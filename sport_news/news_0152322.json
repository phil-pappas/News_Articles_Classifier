Maddie Beaumont (lehighvalleylive.com file photo) \nBeaumont plays goalkeeper in field hockey and has been one of the area’s top players at that position over the last three seasons. She’s started every game since the first game of her sophomore season and says she’s only been banged up once. \n“I was injured my sophomore year when my leg popped out during a game but I played the game after that,” Beaumont said. “I don’t remember who we were playing. I just remember they were rough.” \nBeaumont began participating in gymnastics as a first grader with the Giant Gymnastics organization in Hackettstown. She’s kept up with it to this day. \n“For some reason I fell in love with it,” Beaumont said. “I’ve been doing it ever since.” \nBeaumont has been able to take many of her gymnastics skills and parlay that into success in field hockey. \nRELATED : Kathryn Roncorono winding down a spectacular career for Voorhees field hockey \n“If it wasn’t for gymnastics, I don’t think I’d be as intense as I am,” Beaumont said. “It’s made me tougher. When you’re playing goalie you have to be able to dive and get back up.” \nSecond year Belvidere coach Beth Franceschino has marveled at Beaumont’s success in the cage over the last two seasons. \n“She’s a phenomenal goalie,” Franceschino said. “She has great speed and she’s able to read the ball real well. A lot of times the other team takes a shot and we go ‘oh no,’ and she’s able to come up with a kick save. She’s saved an incredible amount of games for us.” \nBeaumont wasn’t able to save Tuesday’s game against Voorhees, which is ranked 13 th in the state by NJ.com. But she did everything in her power to keep the County Seaters in the game. She registered 11 of her 18 saves in the first half in holding the Vikings to just one goal. \n“She made some incredible saves for us,” Franceschino said. “She’s able to get down on the ground and get back up in a second to get the rebound, which a lot of people can’t do with pads on.” \nVoorhees, led by Kathryn Roncoroni’s hat trick, kept attacking and put it away with three goals in the first eight minutes of the second half. The Vikings outshot Belvidere 22-0. \nBeaumont says squatting, running and vaulting have increased her leg strength, which she’s able to use to her advantage. \n“I just feel they’ve given my legs so much more power,” she said. “Those things just make my whole body ready for the intensity it takes to be a hockey goalie.” \nBeaumont is uncertain of what she’s doing beyond this season. She’d like to play field hockey in college. However, she thinks her days as a gymnast are winding down. \n“I’d like to continue playing hockey because I love it,” she said, “but I really think it’s time to give up gymnastics after my senior year (at Belvidere). It really takes an extreme toll on your body. But I wouldn’t change anything else I’ve done up to now.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
