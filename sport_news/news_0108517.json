Such is the arduous trek that awaits the almost 60 programs that will vie for spots in the NCAA Frozen Four set for April 7-9 in Tampa.\nLast season brought epic highlights, with Providence capturing its first national hockey title, defeating fellow Hockey East entrant Boston University. New England-based teams like PC, BU, Boston College, Harvard, Quinnipiac and Yale all reached the NCAA postseason and more of the same is expected this time around.\nSo here’s a quick peek at what could await:\nTHREE TOP PLAYERS\nSam Anas , Quinnipiac (Jr., F, 5-8, 160): A little scooter on wing who reminds some of ex-BC star Nathan Gerbe with his dynamic breakaway ability. Anas, who was voted national rookie of the year as a freshman, is undrafted. He had 23 goals last season, second-most among returning players, and owns career totals of 45-37-82 in 78 games.\nMatt Grzelcyk , Boston U. (Sr., D, 5-10, 175): Two-year captain from Charlestown is do-it-all player for potent Terriers. Bruins draft pick is among best skating defensemen in college ranks. Shoulder injury curtailed sophomore season, but returned to post All-America campaign last year. Puck always seems to be on his stick.\nJimmy Vesey , Harvard (Sr., F, 6-foot-3, 205 pounds): Senior from North Reading transformed with physical conditioning prior to last season and result was slimmer skater with added speed. It earned the hard worker a Hobey Baker hat trick nomination. Third-round pick of the Predators led the country in goals with 32.\nMOST IMPROVED TEAMS\nNew Hampshire: Wildcats, picked to finish sixth in Hockey East, solved their goaltender issue with midseason addition of Danny Tirone, a sophomore who posted a .924 save percentage and 2.14 goals-against average in 20 games. UNH lost Brett Pesce to the NHL, but returns Matias Cleland and Cam Marks on the back line. Junior forward Tyler Kelleher (18 goals) is small but skilled and linemate Andrew Poturalski (14 goals) can also snipe. “We lost a couple of scorers but I think we have a couple of young scorers that will pick up in that area and in goal I think we’re going to be strong,” said UNH coach Dick Umile.\nUConn: Huskies, slotted for ninth in the preseason HE polls, have quietly been building under the guidance of coach Mike Cavanaugh, who has brought in a slew of talented forwards including Tage Thompson, 6-4 Russian Max Letunov, Senators draft pick Miles Gendron, U.S. National Under-18 player Joe Masonius and Austrian Marco Richter. They join a cast that features junior defenseman Ryan Segalla of Rockland, the first UConn player ever taken in the NHL draft (Pittsburgh, 2013), sophomore forward Spencer Naas (13 goals), and junior Rob Nichols (.918 SP, 1,052 saves).\nYale: Hard to tab a team ranked No. 12 nationally as a surprise in the positive sense, but Bulldogs have pieces to stir the pot. Bruins draft pick Rob O’Gara, a 6-4 senior defenseman, is a first-team All-American, junior goalie Alex Lyon dazzled with 1.62 GAA and .939 save percentage, and junior Mike Doherty of Reading (12 goals) and Frankie DiChiara (team-high 23 points) spearhead the offensive attack. Yale’s penalty kill held foes to under 10 percent and Elis finished plus-32 in goal differential.\nTEAMS WITH QUESTIONS\nNortheastern: The lovable Huskies have a knack for frustrating their fans to tears. In truth, NU will accomplish what it wants to accomplish, especially if it can find good goaltending among the trio of Derick Roy, Jake Theut and Ryan Ruck. A solid defense, led by Bruins draft pick Matt Benning, and clever forwards like All-America Kevin Roy (19-25-44), Dalen Hedges (25 assists) and Zach Aston-Reese (13 goals) bolster hopes. “If you look back at the last two years, we positioned ourselves to take advantage of a playoff opportunity and we failed,” said NU coach Jim Madigan. “So, we talked about it the first day this year: No excuses. We have to win when it counts. We have to win in March.”\nUMass: The Minutemen finished last in the league a year ago and are picked to do the same this season. Fourth-year coach John Micheletto returns just two seniors — forward Shane Walsh of West Roxbury and defenseman Ben Gallacher — so Minutemen must rebuild everywhere. UMass has nine freshmen so defensemen and NHL draft picks Ivan Chukarov (Buffalo) and William Lagesson (Edmonton) will be looked upon to contribute. Newcomer Nic Renyard, the MVP of Alberta Junior Hockey League, is being counted upon to hold the fort in net.\nNotre Dame: The Irish remain an enigma. They return 18 letter-winners, have veteran seniors Ryan Fogarty, Sam Herr, Mario Lucia and Andy Ryan, sport nine NHL draft choices on the roster, and return sophomore goalie Cal Peterson (five consecutive Defensive Player or Rookie Player of the Week honors last season) in net. Coach Jeff Jackson guided Lake Superior State to a pair of NCAA titles (1992 and 1994) and owns a career winning percentage of .658 (408-196-65), second only to Michigan legend Gordon “Red’ Berenson. Yet, the Irish were picked No. 7 in the HE poll. So, what gives?\nTHREE THINGS TO WATCH\nGoaltender interference: In an effort to increase goal scoring, the NCAA and the American Hockey Coaches Association (AHCA) modified the national rule so that now goals will be counted even if an opposing player is in the crease area or has contact with the goaltender. The decision comes down to whether the goaltender is allowed to play the position, according to Dan Schacte, the Hockey East Supervisor of Officials. Schacte said he has instructed HE on-ice officials to use video replay to determine where potential contact occurred, and then for officials to “use their hockey sense.”\nLeague expansion: While Hockey East appears safe (despite persistent rumblings that Quinnipiac would like to join), other leagues could be facing transition. The Big Ten would certainly like to grow.\nCollege age limits: Some coaches have argued that the college game has gotten too old for its own good, as in 24- or 25-year-old seniors. Those same coaches would like to rein in the age limit, requiring players to begin a freshman season within two years of their high school graduating class.
