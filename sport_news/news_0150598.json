With Saudi Arabia leading 2-1, a section of fans in the Shah Alam Stadium let off smoke bombs and flares, causing players from both teams to leave the field. \nThe result will be recorded as a 3-0 victory for Saudi Arabia. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:20:28.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
