University police released a sketch of the man.\nDetectives are urging anyone with information to contact them at (508) 531-1212.\n“Bridgewater State has zero tolerance for misconduct, abuse or violence against any members of our campus community and is committed to preventing and holding accountable anyone responsible for acts of physical and sexual assault,” Jean said.\nThe university did not respond to questions about whether the suspect is believed to be the same man who reportedly raped a female student in a dorm room last month. In that case, the alleged assailant also was not a student and was known to the victim prior to the incident, the university said at the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:04:03.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
