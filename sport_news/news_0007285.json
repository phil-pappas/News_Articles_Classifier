(AP) â€” \nJacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles sprained his throwing shoulder in a 38-31 loss at Tampa Bay on Sunday. The team says Bortles suffered a \"Grade 1 AC joint sprain\" early in the game but played through it. Coach Gus Bradley adds, \"We think he should be in good shape\" to play against Houston on Sunday. Bortles completed 23 of 33 passes for 303 yards, with four touchdowns and an interception, against the Buccaneers. He also was sacked a season-high six times. Bradley says \"don't be surprised if you don't see him out there Wednesday. If he could practice Wednesday, it would be a situation where we don't want him to be sore and affect his throwing mechanics. But we think he should be OK.\" Sign up for our WFTV Sports News Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:00:22.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
