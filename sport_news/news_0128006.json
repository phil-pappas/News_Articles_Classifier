By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nScoop and score. \nNewton High’s Duncan Lee scooped up a Ballard fumble and rambled 48 yards for a touchdown for the Cardinals first score of Friday night’s game. Joseph Banfield, who rushed for 102 yards on 21 carries, capped an eight-play, 58-yard drive with a 5-yard touchdown run for the Cardinals. \nBoth scores came in the fourth quarter of the Class 3A District 6 contest against visiting Ballad’s Bombers at H.A. Lynn Stadium. Unfortunately, the Cardinals were trailing the Bombers, 34-0 at the time. \nNewton’s offense struggled for consistency as it stopped itself with five turnovers and penalties. The Cardinals had four offensive drives in the first half, ending in a fumble after four plays, a punt after 10 plays and two penalties, a fumble after six plays and a penalty, and an interception after seven plays and a penalty. \nIn the second half, it was much the same. The Cardinals were stopped by two fumbles and penalties on three straight drives. At the end of the game, Newton produced a touchdown drive. \n“We were doing things the way we wanted to do them early, and then, we put the ball on the ground,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said. “It took the starch out of us. Our running backs were trying for an extra yard, reaching for it and the ball was knocked out.” \nErgenbright pointed out no matter how disappointing another loss was for his team, he was not disappointed in the effort he saw from his players. He said the Cardinal players worked hard in the game to stay in it against Ballard. \nNewton and Ballard gained the same amount of yardage on the ground — 292 yards. \nFour plays in the game, Newton suffered its first fumble when a Ballard player’s helmet knocked the ball away from Lee. The Bombers took over on the Newton 42-yard line, and Hunter Wright had 34-yard run to the Cardinal 4-yard line. \nNewton’s defense held, turning the Bombers away on a failed fourth-and-goal play when quarterback Maxwell Stoltz fumbled the snap. Stoltz recovered the fumble but at the Newton 13 and the Cardinals took possession of the football. \nRuns by Banfield and Dalton Nevels moved the Cardinals to their own 38. The Cardinals overcame a 10-yard holding penalty on back-to-back runs by Banfield. Another holding penalty stalled the drive and Newton punted the football. \nStoltz guided a nine-play, 87-yard touchdown drive on the ground for the Bombers. Stoltz finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Newton trailed 7-0 with 8:53 left in the second quarter. \nNewton overcame yet another major penalty to begin its next possession. On a first-and-25 play, Nevels, who had 149 yards on 15 carries broke off a 36-yard run to the Ballard 45-yard line. Another Nevels’ gain put the Cardinals at the 26 which was followed by a 14-yard run by Banfield, who lost the football at the 12-yard line. \nWright broke out of the grasp of a Newton defender, reversed his field and scampered 50 yards to jump start Ballard’s second scoring drive. The Cardinal defense put up a battle stopping the Bombers at the 11-yard line, but Stoltz found Tyler Ihle on an 11-yard scoring strike just inside the end zone one a fourth-down play. \n“The zone read offense of Ballard was going to be tough for us to defend. They run it so well. We defended at times. We had guys in position to make tackles and plays. We just didn’t make the plays,” Ergenbright said. \nNewton blocked the extra-point kick so it was 13-0 with 2:27 left in the second quarter. The Cardinals embarked on a drive and was at midfield when on a halfback pass play, Banfield threw an interception with 13 seconds before the break. \nBallard came out of halftime and used two plays to push its lead to 20-0 on a 4-yard touchdown run by Wright following a long run by Kobe Schulze. Ballard recovered a third fumble by the Cardinals and went 45 yards to score on a 6-yard run by Stoltz. \nThe final five minutes of the third quarter were not good for the Cardinals as it was filled with penalties and backward motion. Ballard got the football on the Newton 31-yard line after a punt and Stoltz scored on a 21-yard run with 14 seconds on the clock. \nNewton faced a 34-0 deficit heading into the fourth quarter. It fumbled the ball away at the 10:39 mark of the final period, but the Bombers gave it right back within two minutes. \nThat’s when Lee scooped and scored for Newton. Lee led the Cardinal defense with nine solo tackles, two assisted tackles and a fumble recovery. \nSeeing his first action of the season, Reese Rosenquist made six solo tackles and six assisted tackles. Bryce Tish recorded six tackles and three assisted tackles. Austin James had the lone quarterback sack for the Cardinals. \nWith the defeat, Newton is 0-6 overall and 0-4 in district play. The Cardinals travel to Pella Friday to play 3A top-ranked and defending state champion Pella in non-district play. \n“We have three games left. We’ll stay together and try to get better,” Ergenbright said of his team. “We will keep practicing and playing hard and with the same attitude we had as a 5-1 team a year ago. \n“These are life lessons. It is about how they respond to adversity. Our seniors are great leaders. It’s about believing in themselves and each other.” \nBallard 0-13-21-0—34 \nBallard — Stoltz 2 yd run (Rietz kick) \nBallard — Ihle 11 yd pass from Stoltz (kick blocked) \nBallard — Wright 4 yd run (Rietz kick) \nBallard — Stoltz 6 yd run (Rietz kick) \nBallard — Stoltz 21 yd run (Rietz kick) \nNewton — Lee 48 yd fumble return (Gulling kick) \nNewton — Banfield 5 yd run (Gulling kick) \nNewton Gilbert", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:56:19.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
