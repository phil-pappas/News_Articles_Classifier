Fink had six catches on the drive alone and finished with 10 catches for 127 yards, including a 47-yard reception in the fourth quarter that led to a 36-yard scoring grab for Jarel McGill. \nMcBride finished with 187 passing yards and two scores to go with 48 yards on the ground. \nBrandon Rice paced the Coppell rushing attack with 92 yards on 17 carries. \nWhile Coppell moved the ball effectively, a trio of turnovers proved costly. \nThe first, and interception, occurred in the red zone after Trinity fumbled on the game’s first play from scrimmage. The latter, a fumble, also came in Trinity territory as the Cowboys were on the move and trailing at the time, 7-0. Later in the fourth, Trinity’s Kader Kohou came up with an interception in the end zone. \n“I don’t have a crystal ball, but you sure would have liked to got points there,” DeWitt said of the first turnover. \nOtherwise, it was Trinity and its vaunted ground game controlling the contest. In addition to Wilson’s big night, Javontay Powe chipped in 118 yards on nine carries as the Trojans totaled 539 yards for the game — their third consecutive outing with more than 500 yards rushing. \n“They’re really good,” DeWitt said. “They’re good up front and they have a great scheme. They’re blocking down and arching guys and so you have to try to be plus-one. And when you are, then you have to try to tackle a really good back. Hats off to them. I think they’re going to win a lot of football games.” \nCoppell will look to tighten the screws defensively at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Colleyville Heritage. \n“I was proud of how the kids battled not just here on the field, but mentally having to come out and go back and come out and so on,” DeWitt said. “We’re a tough team and we’ll go regroup and get some rest and get ready for Colleyville (starting) tomorrow.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:09:07.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
