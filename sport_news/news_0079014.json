Yet even if he’s past his injuries, it remains to be seen whether the 34-year-old Calderon, whom the Knicks acquired from the Dallas Mavericks in a trade before last season, still has the foot speed to keep up with the league’s quickest, most athletic position.\nFisher, himself just two years removed from his own career as an NBA point guard, can relate. Strong fundamentals allowed him to play until age 39 and overcome limited quickness and athleticism at the end of an 18-year career.\nENLARGE “Though Fish wasn’t as quick or inventive as some of the younger point guards in the league… he had a gift for pushing the ball up court and making our offense run properly,” wrote Phil Jackson, now the Knicks team president, in his book, “Eleven Rings.” “He was an excellent three-point shooter when the clock was running down.”\nCalderon shares those qualities. His 4-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio over the course of a 10-year career ranks fourth-best in NBA history among players with at least 2,000 assists, behind only Muggsy Bogues, John Paxson and Chris Paul, and ahead of Hall of Famer John Stockton.\nAnd Calderon, who was already one of the league’s premier shooters, has enjoyed his best seasons from behind the arc since turning 30—an NBA-best 46% in 2012, and 44.9% in 2013—suggesting that he still has something to offer on the offensive end. (Based on that, Fisher said he’s been nudging Calderon to look for his shot more.)\nENLARGE Knicks coach Derek Fisher, right, was a 39-year-old guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder during the 2013-14 season.

While he’s always been more perimeter-oriented, Calderon’s inability to pressure defenses by getting into the paint was especially troubling. According to SportVU player-tracking technology, he drove toward the basket just 2.3 times per 36 minutes, last among starting point guards by a considerable margin.\nENLARGE On defense, things were just as bad, if not worse. Aside from getting beat at the point of attack by quicker guards, he struggled to close out on perimeter shooters. In fact, opposing players shot a league-high 48% from three-point range last year when Calderon was the closest defender to the play, per NBA Savant. (Another eye-popping number: He allowed 50% shooting or better from the field in nine of the final 10 games he played in 2014-15.)\nCalderon recognizes that he wasn’t the point guard the Knicks desperately needed last season, and believes he can still get the job done.\n“I don’t need to be the fastest or be able to jump highest to be effective or do the right things to help the team,” said Calderon, who is under contract until 2017. “But it’s tough, because some guys are going to score on you. Someone like [Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook], who averages 25 a game? He’s going to score. But you’ve got to fight through it and do the best you can and trust that a low-post guy will step up and have your back when you need it. Some situations are one-on-one, but when we play as five guys and follow our plan, we should be OK.”\n‘ I don’t need to be the fastest or be able to jump highest to be effective or do the right things to help the team. But it’s tough, because some guys are going to score on you. ’\n—Jose Calderon Fisher said he’ll consider shifting Calderon to shooting guard at times to reduce the defensive pressure on him, similar to how he and Jason Kidd made late-career transitions to that spot. Otherwise, as someone who also had to guard quicker players at an advanced basketball age, his advice to Calderon was relatively simple: Use what you still have left.\n“The greatest of the great, as they go from 20 to 30 to 40, they lose things,” Fisher said. “But what separates you is your ability to still be good at who you are. And being healthy this year, I think Jose will be able to do that. Using his IQ and his awareness of the game the defensive end, he can still be solid on that end.”\nWrite to Chris Herring at chris.herring@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AD934_NYKNIC_9U_20151020154808.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AD935_NYKNIC_9U_20151020154825.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AD934_NYKNIC_16U_20151020154808.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AD935_NYKNIC_16U_20151020154825.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV857_KNICKS_P_20151020155346.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV857_KNICKS_M_20151020155346.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:01:11.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
