Utah (4-0, 1-0) The Utes’ win against Michigan continues to look better and better as the Wolverines move up to No. 18 in the AP top-25 poll this week. Utah is currently the king of the Pac-12, and Salt Lake City will host ESPN’s “College GameDay” for the Utes’ showdown against Cal this weekend. Did anyone see this coming? 2. Stanford (4-1, 3-0) Guessing no one has asked Coach David Shaw if his offense is too conservative lately. Since dropping the season opener 16-6 at Northwestern, the Cardinal has averaged 42.3 points per game. Helmet stickers goes to a punishing offensive line, which is making stars out of QB Kevin Hogan and RB Christian McCaffrey, who leads the nation with 229.8 all-purpose yards per game. 3. USC (3-1, 1-1) The 17-point favorite Trojans better take care of business Thursday against the Huskies because they next face three ranked teams in No. 15 Notre Dame, No. 5 Utah and No. 23 California. Since 1955, USC is 56-16-1 (.767) after a bye. 4. Arizona State (3-2, 1-1) It took a month, but the Sun Devils finally looked like the team many thought they would in the upset at UCLA. Sidenote: Kalen Ballage’s late TD shove, er, run has to be on the shortlist for the Pac-12 touchdown of the year. 5. UCLA (4-1, 1-1) Can’t write off the Bruins after their first loss, but their 38-23 defeat to Arizona State was an ugly setback that exposed some weakness on both sides of the ball. If UCLA can’t run for more than 62 yards, then powder-blue fans can’t expect freshman QB Josh Rosen to be a miracle worker. Especially not this week against a Stanford defense that ranks second in the Pac-12 in yards allowed. 6. Cal (5-0, 2-0) The Golden Bears may be the first 5-0 team in history that isn’t likely be favored in their next four games. They took advantage of a relatively soft early schedule and jumped out to their best start since 2007. Things get decidedly tougher going forward starting this Saturday at No. 5 Utah followed by No. 20 UCLA, No. 17 USC and Oregon. 7. Oregon (3-2, 1-1) The Ducks got away from Colorado by the skin of their teeth. This Oregon team has been exposed for its poor defense and lack of a passing game. That leaky pass defense will be tested against Washington State this weekend. 8. Arizona (3-2, 0-2) Another team that’s struggling on defense. Arizona allowed 111 points in the last two weeks and opponents have averaged 453 yards per game against the Wildcats this season. Sure, losing QB Anu Solomon was a blow, but fixing that defense should be Arizona’s primary concern right now. 9. Washington (2-2, 0-1) Huskies got to sit back and survey their opponents on their much-needed bye. You know they’ll come out fired up this week to play former UW coach Steve Sarkisian, who will be facing his old team for the first time since he left for USC. 10. Washington State (2-2, 0-1) If nothing else, at least the Cougars have the best facilities in the Pac-12 . 11. Colorado (3-2, 0-1) Who are these guys? The trip to Boulder is no longer the rest-and-relax vacation it has been the past few years. The Buffaloes, behind gritty junior QB Sefo Liufau, put up a fight into the fourth quarter against Oregon. The next step is closing out a close Pac-12 game, and they don’t look far off from that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:36:28.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
