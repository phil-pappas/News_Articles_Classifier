There's even a term detractors toss around \"Clemsoning,\" when arguing how unreliable the Tigers can be when in the mix for bigger things. \nBut the Georgia Tech victory was Clemson's 33rd straight over an unranked opponent and proved perhaps these Tigers have more staying power than in the past. \nThe proof began three plays in when Gallman swept around the left end and went 66 yards for the Tigers longest play of the year and a 7-0 lead on the game's third play. \nThomas was intercepted moments later and the Tigers tacked on a field goal to take an early double-digit lead for the second straight contest. While Clemson struggled to build on its 14-0 lead on Notre Dame last week, it little problem piercing the Yellow Jackets defense. Watson went 5-of-5 passing for 68 yards on a second-quarter drive Gallman finished from a yard out for his second TD and a 17-3 lead. \nWatson went to the air in the second quarter, finding Leggett on scoring passes of 29 and 8 yards to take a 33-10 lead at half. \nThe Tigers also got a safety off a blocked punt that looked like something from a Three Stooges short. The ball was snapped over the head of punter Ryan Rodwell, who picks up the ball and boots a low liner that hits off Clemson defender Jadar Johnson before bouncing through several hands and out of the end zone. \nIt was a dominating show by Clemson, which outgained Georgia Tech 318 to 109 in the opening half. \nThe Yellow Jackets, who came in leading the ACC with 311 yards a game on the ground, were held to 56 in the first half by Clemson's defense. They did not do much better after halftime, gaining just 15 on the ground the final 30 minutes. \nGeorgia Tech's previous low rushing during Johnson's time was 79 yards gained on the ground in a 10-7 over Gardner-Webb on Oct. 11, 2008 in the coach's first season. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:41:25.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
