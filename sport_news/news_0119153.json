You don’t have to wait for a play. You just go and drive.”\nStevens, in turn, learned something new last night after not playing David Lee (rest), Avery Bradley (rest), Marcus Smart (illness) or Terry Rozier (knee).\n“Amir worked well with Tyler ( Zeller ), and that’s not (a combination) we’ve used before,” said the Celtics coach. “Amir was great. He hasn’t scored it like that every day in practice, but he has been a threat to make shots every day. He just knows how to play both ends. He makes easy plays with the ball, and in the defensive end he makes everyone better.”\nOf particular note were the back-to-back 3-pointers Johnson hit in the first quarter.\nIn the absence of Smart and Bradley, Stevens started a backcourt of Isaiah Thomas and Evan Turner . Thomas finished with 17 points and nine assists. Turner, in his first action after missing the two European games with a strained knee, added 10 points, seven assists and five rebounds.\nRookie R.J. Hunter continued to show a savvy beyond his age with 11 points last night, including a team-high three 3-pointers.\nCheck it out\nJonas Jerebko played his share of hockey while growing up in Sweden. So when the Nets’ Jarrett Jack flew shoulder-first into him during a second quarter fast break — knocking both players to the floor and earning Jack an ejection-inducing Flagrant 2 foul — the C’s forward must have felt like he was back home, right?\n“No, I never played football,” said Jerebko. “It was just a frustration play from him. I don’t know why, I was just trying to make a layup and got hit pretty hard. I’m good.”\nJerebko admitted to having a sore back from the play. Jack agreed with Jerebko — he threw the check out of frustration.\n“I didn’t mean to do that,” said Jack, who admitted that the referee made the right call. “It was a little bit of heat of the moment, a little bit of frustration more than anything, and my intention wasn’t to do that at all. It was a frustration foul.”\nLonging for change\nAnother preseason, another home-and-home series between the Celtics and Nets, with the latter visiting the Garden next Monday.\nDon’t blame Nets coach Lionel Hollins for wanting some variety.\n“Certainly would prefer it,” he said last night. “I always tell the story that when I was in Philly we played Boston three times in the (preseason), seven times during the regular season, and then a seven-game series against them. Two straight years — it’s a bit much.\n“I wouldn’t mind playing some of the western teams that are close by,” said Hollins. “It is what it is, and it’s easy to get to these teams — not a huge issue, but I would prefer to play some team you don’t play all year long, in your division, in your conference that you’re not battling for playoff position. It was the same when I was in Portland and we played Seattle. It gets real tense as it goes along.”\nToo sick to fly\nSmart’s chances of flying down for tomorrow night’s game against the Knicks are remote.\n“He was feeling a little better, but he actually has strep throat, so it’s doubtful,” said Stevens. . . .\nRozier is learning to simply observe and work on his patience.\n“You still can learn by watching, and it’s especially good to be with the team in a place like New York,” he said. “I look forward to the trip and finally watching other NBA teams. I’m actually working on my patience in coming back. They’ve given me an understanding of how important a healthy body is. I will be back Saturday for practice.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:27:15.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
