The Rams head into their bye week with a 3-4 mark. ( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nFORT COLLINS â€” Sam Carlson didn't want to think about the alternative, and he was glad he didn't. \nColorado State heads into the bye week off a 38-23 victory over Air Force, which is much better than on a three-game losing streak, which was also a possibility before the game was played. \nWhat a nightmare that would have been. \n\"I'd rather not think about it. We won today, so I'm going to enjoy this one,\" Carlson said. \"It will be so much better. I imagine if we would have lost this game it would have left a pretty bad taste in our mouth and made the bye week that much worse, because you'd have to think about it. Now, we're coming off a victory, it will give us momentum going into San Diego State and we're going to worry about ourselves this week, get right and come ready to play two weeks for now.\" \nBut as good as the win feels, Colorado State coach Mike Bobo doesn't want his team to get too far ahead of itself. The Rams (3-4, 1-2 Mountain West) looked good in all three phases of the game against Air Force, but they haven't done anything consistently well enough to be able to count on any type of performance. \nNot yet. \n\"This whole football team needs to realize that because we won this one football game we have not arrived,\" Bobo said. \"We have a lot of work to do, a lot of improvement to do. We're still playing a lot of young players that got to continue to get better. \n\"We're going to enjoy this win, but we've got to go back to work. We have to continue to do what we do to earn the right to win on Saturdays.\" \nThe work will begin on Tuesday, as the Rams practice three straight days. Bobo and his coordinators will meet on Sunday, but the rest of the coaching staff will hit the road recruiting, then go back out to watch players on Friday. As for the practices themselves, Bobo said they will focus more on fundamentals, with just a bit of work being done on the Aztecs. \nThe players already have an idea of what will be addressed, too. \n\"Penalties,\" said cornerback Tyree Simmons bluntly after the Rams were flagged nine more times against the Falcons. \"We get penalties and it messes us up and it gives the other team opportunities. We're playing hard, but we've got to reduce the penalties.\" \nLike the coaches, the end of the week will give the players a chance to check in on their families, and do so without the extra burden of a losing streak. \n\"I can go home at peace. I plan on going home for the bye week, and it just gives us that uplifting spirit for the next home game,\" defensive end SteveO Michel said. \"It gives you something to look forward to because you won before the bye week and coming out, it's like we can win the next one. One-and-0 is what we preach, and we got 1-0 (Saturday). Bye week get rested, then get ready for San Diego State.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:15:43.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
