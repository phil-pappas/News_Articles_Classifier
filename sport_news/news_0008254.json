Surprised that they don't have an interception at this point just because of the way they've been playing throughout their career. It's just one of those things where things haven't fallen right into place. They've had opportunities to make certain plays, and it is what it is.\" \nSeattle head coach Pete Carroll is impressed with what he's seen of Dalton so far this season. \n\"He's been extremely consistent and he's been accurate with the ball,\" said Carroll. \"They give him a lot of chances to put the ball down the field and he's made a lot of big plays, and his receivers have come through for him. They've had extraordinary protection, too (two sacks in the first four games). They've kept people off balance throughout. They're just off to a terrific start and look very difficult.\" \nDalton has not only performed well off the field, but has shown a different side to his personality off it as NFL.com captured here when it put a microphone on him during this past Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs. \n\"I like the way he is,\" said offensive coordinator Hue Jackson. \"I love the fire. I love the passion. I can just go by this year. This year he has been outstanding and he has to continue to be. He's playing well and I want him to continue to play well and he knows that for our offense to go he has to go and he takes that on his shoulders and brings that every week.\" \nJackson was asked if it's the most outgoing he has seen him? \n\"No, you have to remember I'm around him a lot,\" said Jackson. \"I'm in classrooms with him. I'm in all kinds of different settings with him. I think what you guys are seeing is finally his personality is showing. I tell all the guys, let your personality show, it's OK. I don't judge guys by what they are, how they are, all that. I judge them by the way you play. In the end that's what it's all about.\" \nBoth Jackson and Dalton said the Bengals offense can play even better. \n\"We are just scratching the surface,\" said Jackson. \"We've got a lot more games. We are not caught up in any of this. I know everybody else is, but this is the expectation. He's only doing what he's supposed to do. I don't get all enamored like everybody else does because I believe there is still another level for him. He's got to go chase it and go get it.\" \nSaid Dalton: \"I think we're playing to our potential and there's still more out there that we can go grab. That's what's fun about this: We've done well up to this point, but we still haven't played our best.\" \nPhoto: Tony Tribble for Local12 \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
