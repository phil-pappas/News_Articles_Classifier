Starting a drive from their own 2-yard line, the Wildcats slowly chipped their way down the field and hit a 32-yard field goal as time expired. When Eastern Guilford returned from the halftime break, it opened the third quarter with a seven-minute scoreless drive. Despite 16 consecutive minutes of possession, the Wildcats only had three points to show for themselves, leading to a 6-3 loss. “They definitely had the ball more than we would have liked them to,” said Williams coach Dave Grant. “They were nickel and diming it down the field on us there and I was getting a little paranoid. But when we had to make plays, we made plays.” Williams (3-5 overall, 1-4 Mid-State 3-A Conference) showed lots of offensive promise in the first quarter as sophomore running back Isaiah Coleman recorded 77 rushing yards. His most memorable highlight was his 12-yard rushing touchdown with 3:07 remaining in the opening quarter. Our line just stepped up in the first quarter because this was a big game for us to get back on track,” Coleman said. “Plays just opened up for me.” The Bulldogs’ running game, however, grew stagnant as the game progressed. They averaged more than 8 yards per carry in the first quarter but finished the game with around 4 yards per carry. Eastern Guilford (4-3, 2-2) also failed to generate much offensive momentum. Junior kicker Cameron Smith scored the lone points for the Wildcats with a 32-yard field goal to end the first half but missed a 34-yard attempt in the third quarter. Sophomore quarterback Dominique Graves, who’s filling in for the team’s injured starter, also struggled with his passing game. On a couple occasions, he overshot open receivers. When he did make quality throws, his receivers either dropped them or got tackled immediately. With 10:01 remaining in the game, Williams recovered a fumble at their own 18-yard line. Although Eastern Guilford had other opportunities to score late in the game, this blunder swung the momentum in Williams’ direction. “They were making tackles as soon as we caught it,” said Eastern Guilford coach Doug Robertson. “They didn’t give up any big plays, which made us drive down the whole field. It was great to have that time of possession, but we’ve got to score.” The Bulldogs gobbled up much of the clock late in the game and converted on two fourth downs on their final possession to secure their first league victory. “We need to enjoy this moment and soak it all in and do it again next week,” Grant said. “We needed a win and we got one. We’ll enjoy it for a day or two and get back to work on Monday.” By Bryan Anderson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:03:56.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
