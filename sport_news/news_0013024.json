The Patriots quarterback doesn’t do his talking in midweek podium sessions or in toxic newspaper headlines.\nHe does his talking on the field. And Hardy’s comments Tuesday about Brady’s wife Gisele Bundchen probably guaranteed that talking will reveal itself on the scoreboard on Sunday.\nReally now, what’s the Cowboys defensive end thinking? What’s this clown, who just finished serving a four-game suspension stemming from domestic violence, doing riling up Brady and making him all crazy by mentioning the quarterback’s supermodel wife in a creepy message?\n“I love seeing Tom Brady. He’s cool as crap,” Hardy told the Dallas Morning News. “You seen his wife? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game. (I hope) all her friends come to the game.”\nThat little ditty could be construed as an attempt at an all-out mind game with Brady. Yeah, there’s an idea: Let’s just further tick off the guy who’s playing the best of anybody in the league by talking about his wife and sister-in-law.\nHasn’t Hardy been watching what Brady’s been doing with the added motivation of Deflategate? Hasn’t he watched the Patriots quarterback shred apart one defense after another this season? One can only imagine what No. 12 will do now after hearing these warped remarks from a gun-loving football player aimed at the love of his life.\nNaturally, Brady brushed off the remarks yesterday and complimented Hardy’s ability to the hilt. He played it cool and completely professional, although, you could sense some agitation.\n“I’m just getting ready to play. I’ve got to focus on my job,” Brady said when asked if Hardy’s questionable comments ticked him off. “He’s a great player. We’ve got to fix a lot of different things to handle a guy like that. He’s been a great player since he’s been in the league. We’re going to have to prepare for him and be ready for all the different types of moves he’s got. They’ve got a good D-line anyway. They count on getting pressure from their front four to get to the quarterback. So, I don’t really care about his personal feelings.”\nBrady obviously knows the background with this nut job. And he was probably also told about Hardy’s opening salvo to the media on Tuesday?\n“I hope to come out guns blazin’,” Hardy told DallasCowboys.com. “I’m full of excitement and full of juice.”\nGuns blazin ’?\nHardy’s suspension arose from a domestic violence incident in which he was alleged to have thrown his then-girlfriend onto a futon covered in assault weapons. He was also accused of choking her and threatening to kill her.\nSo all of that just played into Hardy’s weird message to Brady and Gisele. Creepy? You bet.\nCowboys coach Jason Garrett attempted to restore a sense of calm during a conference call with New England media, but knew the fire that had been lit not only for Brady, but likely the entire Patriots team.\n“Typically we try to keep things in-house here with the Cowboys,” Garrett said. “Greg’s excited to be playing. Sometimes things come out of your mouth when you’re excited. I think he has an understanding, (that) it’s more important to define yourself by what you do as a player than anything else. So I think he’ll learn from those comments and the reaction to them. I don’t think there was anything . . . there was no bad intent from any of it. I just think he’s excited to get back playing football.”\nHardy might not be so excited after Brady’s through ripping apart the Cowboys defense.\nRemember, Hardy is the guy who was originally suspended 10 games by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell for the domestic violence incident, before having that sentence trimmed to four games after an appeal. Funny how that’s the same number Goodell assessed Brady for deflated footballs.\nIt was pretty obvious the Patriots quarterback had his game face on yesterday while speaking with the media. Don’t worry, it doesn’t matter if the Cowboys don’t have Tony Romo or Dez Bryant Sunday. He’ll be ready for Hardy and the Cowboys, you can take that to the bank. You might say, he’ll have those familiar daggers in his eyes.\n“There’s no letdown for us. We’re trying to establish a certain level of play, and we got off to a decent start this year. So we’ve got to keep it going,” Brady said. “You know, we’ve got to sustain good practices, good games, good weeks, and see if we can just keep building.\n“This (Cowboys) team could easily be 4-0. They’re playing at home. They’ve got a lot of good players, (they’re a) very talented team. Last year, they were one of the best teams in football. They could’ve beaten the Saints easily last week in overtime, so they’re a very good football team. I know it’s going to be a big test for our team.”\nSaints quarterback Drew Brees picked apart the Cowboys defense in their Sunday night matchup, and he was throwing with a bum rotator cuff.\nBrady?\nWith Hardy reigniting his ire with such inappropriate comments about his wife, he will crush the Cowboys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:43:22.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
