Here are this week's selections starting with Thursday night's Atlanta Falcons at New Orleans Saints game: \nNow that the Atlanta Falcons have swept the NFC East, they finally get a taste of their own division. \nThat comes Thursday night at New Orleans, where the struggling Saints try to slow their archrival's march through the conference. \nThe Falcons (5-0) have learned how to win the close ones under new coach Dan Quinn, and only Arizona has scored more than Atlanta's 162 points. A thrilling comeback win over Washington — the Falcons have made a habit of those — gave them sole possession of the NFC South lead because Carolina (4-0) was idle. \n\"We're not going to let anyone else dictate our readiness,\" said Quinn as he looked at a short week to prepare for New Orleans. \"How we play, how we approach each week. We're always prepared to go as long as we to have to. They just won't stop backing off and competing.\" \nAtlanta ( No. 5 in AP Pro32 ) is a 3-point choice over No. 27 New Orleans, which comes off a pedestrian performance in a loss at Philadelphia. The Saints (1-4) can't run the ball or stop the run and only winless Detroit has more giveaways in the NFC. \n\"You just focus strictly on the game ahead,\" Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan said. \"That's something that's proven to help us and I'm hoping to do the same this year.\" \nNope. \nNo. 24 Kansas City (plus 3 1-2) at No. 14 Minnesota \nVikings are well-rested team, Chiefs are banged-up and demoralized one. \nBEST BET: VIKINGS, 23-13 \nNo. 23 Baltimore (minus 2 1-2) at No. 28 San Francisco \nHarbaugh vs. Harbaugh in the coaching rematch — oh wait. Older brother Jim is a Wolverine now. \nUPSET SPECIAL: 49ERS, 21-16 \nNo. 1 New England (minus 7 1-2) at No. 12 Indianapolis \nPatriots continue their get-even-with-everybody campaign by — dare we? — deflating Colts. \nPATRIOTS, 30-20 \nNo. 10 (tie) New York Giants (plus 4) at No. 17 Philadelphia, Monday night \nAnybody have a healthy wideout to lend the Giants? \nEAGLES, 23-17 \nNo. 16 San Diego (plus 10) at No. 2 Green Bay \nAaron Rodgers begins another interception-free home streak. \nPACKERS, 33-20 \nNo. 3 Cincinnati (minus 3 1-2) at No. 13 Buffalo \nBills are too banged-up to slow down the Bengals' express. \nBENGALS, 20-10 \nNo. 4 Denver (minus 4) at No. 22 Cleveland \nDenver's spotless record could get marked here. We think Broncos scrape through. \nBRONCOS, 19-16 \nNo. 7 Carolina (plus 6 1-2) at No. 10 (tie) Seattle \nPanthers' spotless record will get marked, but Seahawks don't do anything easily. \nSEAHAWKS, 20-19 \nNo. 21 Washington (plus 6) at No. 8 New York Jets \nJets come off bye, get Sheldon Richardson back to boost strong D. \nJETS, 20-13 \nNo. 6 Arizona (minus 3) at No. 9 Pittsburgh \nCardinals hung out at West Virginia resort while Steelers needed every second in San Diego. \nCARDINALS, 24-16 \nNo. 29 Houston (minus 1 1-2) at No. 32 Jacksonville \nNot much to like with either of these clubs so far. \nJAGUARS, 17-16 \nNo. 30 Miami (plus 3) at No. 25 Tennessee \nNot much to like with either of these clubs, either. Dolphins coaching change could help. \nDOLPHINS, 17-14 \nNo. 20 Chicago (plus 3) at No. 31 Detroit \nForget about 0-16, Lions finally get it right, but barely. \nLIONS, 17-16 \nKNOCKOUT LEAGUE TIP \nWhen we have a survivor, it's by the skin of the pigskin. Last week, the NEW YORK GIANTS were that team. Whew! \nThis time, we'll go with NEW ENGLAND. \n2015 RECORD \nAgainst spread: Week 8-5, Season (41-32-1). \nStraight up: Week 9-5, Season (50-27) \nBest Bet: 3-2 against spread, 4-1 straight up. \nUpset special: 1-4 against spread, 1-4 straight up. \nPhoto: Tony Tribble for Local12.com. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
