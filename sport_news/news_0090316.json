Liberty won the toss and opted to receive, but it never did as Carson Landis booted a high pooch kick for the Green Hornets. \nThe ball squirted away from the Hurricanes and into the hands of Emmaus’ Brandon Rapose . \nThe Green Hornets ran play-action on their first offensive snap and Derek Sheaffer found Kyle Carraher for a 28-yard pass, which ultimately set up a 23-yard field goal from Landis for the 3-0 lead. \nAfter Kyle Boney ran in one of four touchdowns on the night for the 10-7 lead, Emmaus went back to the pooch kick and again it worked with Rapose falling on the loose ball. \n“We were able to get some turnovers on the short pooch kicks, which we were planning on using,” Cuthbert said. \nThe Green Hornets went into halftime trailing 28-24, but certainly looked to be within striking distance, especially since they were getting the ball to begin the second half. \nBut they were immediately faced with a third-and-18 on their own 40-yard line. Instead of trying to play the field position game with Landis getting off booming punts all night, Emmaus tried the fake punt. It backfired, as Sal Pagano took the snap but only got one yard on the run with no hole to run through. \n“We ran the fake punt and one guy didn’t get the call and didn’t block his guy,” Cuthbert said. “If he blocks him, (Pagano) is running down the sideline. But it’s stuff like that we need to get better, executing overall for a whole game.” \nThe Green Hornets defense did play a better second half to keep their team in the game, limiting Liberty to 17 yards through the air and 108 yards on the ground over the final two quarters. \nBut with a chance to pull off the upset late, Emmaus failed to put together the big drive. Cuthbert said it was his team's best effort since a season-opening win against East Stroudsburg North, but it still wasn't enough. \n“We have to be better in the second half,” Cuthbert said. “Defensively in the second half we played much better so that’s a positive sign. It’s something we gotta build on.” \nThe Green Hornets can take solace in the fact that they have Boney to build around – he finished with 27 carries for 216 yards and four scores – but Thursday proved again he can’t do it all on his own. \n“Kyle’s a warrior. He’s a battler,” Cuthbert said. “He’s a unique back cause he’s that big and he can move that quickly. He can read blocks and he can run around you and run through you. He’s been big for us all year and the offense is centered around him. We’re starting to make some more plays throwing the ball, which is a positive. We need to keep doing that. We just need some plays.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:51:30.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
