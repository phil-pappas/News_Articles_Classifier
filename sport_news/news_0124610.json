IN THE THICK OF THINGS: Matt Burston of the Taipans wins the ball over Steven Marcovic of the Kings. Source: Getty Images \nCAIRNS got a brutal reminder of how tough it will be to replicate last season’s dominance, beaten comfortably by a Sydney Kings side missing their best player in what was the Taipans’ second game in three days. \nThe Taipans, coming off a 79-74 defeat of Illawarra on Thursday night to open their NBL season, were blown away by the Kings to trail by 25 at halftime. \nThey eventually fell 87-63 in a largely uninspired showing, Sydney far too sharp even without NBA ­stalwart and National Basketball League MVP favourite Josh Childress (foot). In his absence Julian Khazzouh assumed the role of tormentor in their home opener, finishing with 22 points, nine rebounds and five blocks. \nSydney were woeful in the pre-season Blitz but showed they would be finals contenders in a result that sent the Snakes crashing back to earth. \nCairns were again without Cameron Tragardh (calf), but unlike on Thursday could not pull themselves out of the hole when needed, shooting four of 26 triples and 33 per cent from the field. \nSydney’s score was almost double Cairns’ in both the first and second quarters before parity was restored, but it was too late. \nIn a season that will feature back-to-back games almost every weekend, the Taipans will have to get better at backing up. \n“You can’t play catch-up on the road like that,” captain Cameron Gliddon said. \nMark Worthington and Stephen Weigh were again consistent for Cairns but neither could match the efforts of Khazzouh or Jason Cadee (19 points, seven assists). After a quiet debut, Cairns import Markel Starks (six points on 30 per cent shooting, five rebounds­ and three turnovers) offered little more in his matinee and did not escape the scrutiny of his coach. \n“It’s early days, but there’s no question they (Starks and fellow import Torrey Craig) need to perform, but it’s not just those two,” Fearne said. \n“It was just a poor team performance. We didn’t match their edge and defensively we were a step behind everything.” \nAt least one Cairns product tasted success, with Redlynch alumni Jeromie Hill scoring eight points and adding two rebounds­ and an assist in his NBL debut for Sydney. \nAnd in Adelaide, Bamaga product Nate Jawai celebrated his return to the NBL with a win. He scored Perth’s first points and finished with 11 plus six rebounds­ and three assists as the Wildcats surged past the 36ers 79-66. \nCairns host Townsville this Saturday night, with Tragardh a chance to play what would be his 299th NBL game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:29:33.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
