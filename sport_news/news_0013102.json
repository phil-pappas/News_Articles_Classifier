(Photo by Matthias Leguire) \nBy TED RADICK staff writer UPPER SANDUSKY — Coach Caroline O’Brien and her Lima Shawnee Indians felt pretty confindent entering Monday’s Division II girls soccer district opener at Upper Sandusky. Shawnee grinds it out game in and game out in the tough Western Buckeye League, and that strength of schedule paid dividends as the Indians made a first-half goal stand up for a 1-0 victory. The Indians, seeded eighth in the Elida district, may have entered the game with a 6-6-4 record, and some may have thought them underdogs against a Rams squad that was 11-4-1 coming in. O’Brien begs to differ.“Absolutely, our league schedule had us prepared for this game,” she said. “It was kind of nice not having to play a WBL school in the first round of the tournament. With Upper having just one seed number higher than us, we thought it would be a good matchup.” Four WBL teams (Lima Bath, Celina, Wapakoneta and Ottawa-Glandorf) won 12 games during the regular season. Shawnee was a competitive 3-4-2 in WBL play and was forged by that caliber of competition.“That is one of the best girls soccer leagues in the state, for Division II, if not the best,” Upper Sandusky coach Patrick Massara said. “Any of the top four teams will battle any of the top teams in the state.“Top to bottom, it’s very strong. Shawnee would certainly be among the top three teams in our league (North Central Ohio Soccer Association). They tied Liberty-Benton who was undefeated and hands down the best team in our league.” Shawnee got the game’s lone goal a little more than 10 minutes into the game. Working down the left side of the field, the Indians used a couple of quick crossing passes to send the ball left. O’Brien said that was the plan on a windy afternoon.“The wind was a little bit of a battle today,” she said. “We told the kids to play a little bit more direct and a little bit more toward feet, so we could keep possession. We’ve really worked on our possession game more this year, and the kids have really embraced it.” Maddie O’Connell took a crossing pass in the middle and crossed it herself to Carly Gronas. Gronas broke free to run onto the ball near the top right of the penalty box. She moved in a few yards and fired low and to the left of a sprawling Makenna Searls for the goal. Upper responded later in the half, but it didn’t come easy. Shawnee’s effective midfield allowed the Indians to keep four defenders back, and the Rams tried to beat the defense with long shots. Upper’s Abigail Gerber fired a long shot that was saved by Shawnee keeper Nikole McPheron with 16 minutes to halftime. Megan Hensel sent a long shot over the crossbar a minute later, and a minute after that Maddy Casey saw her long attempt saved by McPheron.“Our defense did a great job not allowing anyone to get open inside the box, and our mids did a great job coming back and contesting some of their longer shots,” O’Brien said. That strong defense was needed in the second half as Upper was going with the wind.“We knew with the wind at their back the second half, they were going to be ripping some from 35 and 40 yards out,” O’Brien said. Upper’s best chance all game came 10 minutes into the second half. Winger Sierra Carey put a spin move on her defender and broke in alone on McPheron. Carey’s strong, low shot was gobbled up by the Shawnee keeper.“With Nikole back in goal, I knew that we would be OK,” O’Brien said. “That was a nice shutout for her.”“I was hoping,” Massara said of Carey’s chance. “I’m never convinced until the ball goes in.” Massara said the Rams may have pushed too far forward at times, allowing McPheron and the Shawnee defense to cut down angles on shots to the goal.“Sometimes when we moved up we played it too close to the goal instead of at the PK spot or the top of the box,” he said. “We didn’t give ourselves a chance to finish.” That said, Massara liked Carey being aggressive with her run.“It was another one of those, we practice that every time, you cut and you go line. She got the line, and she’s good there,” he said. “She got down low and, like I said, maybe a little too close to the keeper.” Up next for Shawnee, on the road at 5 p.m. Thursday, is WBL foe Ottawa-Glandorf, the Division II state runner-up a year ago. The second-seeded Titans (12-4, 7-2 WBL) beat Shawnee 1-0 in a league game in mid-September.“This should give us a little momentum going into O-G on Thursday,” O’Brien said. “We played O-G pretty well the first time we had them earlier this season. We lost by a goal. I think we have some good chances and some good momentum having won the last three games.“If we keep the passing patterns going and the movement going, we should be OK.” Massara will look for continued improvement for his Upper squad next year. The Rams tied a school record for victories this season, a mark that was set just last year.“We just have to get over the hump,” he said. “We’ve still never finished on top of the league, we’ve still never won a tournament game. Those are definite goals these girls will want next year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:51:11.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
