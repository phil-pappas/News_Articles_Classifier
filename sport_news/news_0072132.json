(Bill Wippert | The Associated Press) Comments \nOrchard Park, N.Y. — In one corner of the Buffalo Bills ' locker room was Kyle Williams. The veteran defensive tackle couldn't unlace his own shoes after getting carted off the field late in the team's 34-21 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals with a knee injury. On the other side of the room, Sammy Watkins gingerly took the tape of his ankle and made his way through the locker room on one crutch. \nThe Bills again lost more than a football game when they dropped to 3-3 on Sunday. They lost Watkins and Williams to what look to be somewhat significant injuries. They also lost starting right tackle Seantrel Henderson to a concussion and wide receiver Marquise Goodwin with injured ribs. \nMeanwhile, quarterback Tyrod Taylor and wide receiver Percy Harvin didn't play Sunday, meaning the Bills limped out of Week 6 with six starters on the mend. There's a chance all six won't play against the Jaguars in Week 7. \n\"I think the thing that's killing me right now. I mean, it's frustrating,\" Ryan said. \"Injuries are a part of the game, there's no question about it, but it's we've been so snake bit. It's just unbelievable to me. \n\"I think it's affecting everybody's morale, mine included. ... You have a vision of what this team can be when we're healthy, and it's just frustrating because you don't have your parts. I know we can compete with anybody, but it just seems like we take a step forward and then we end up taking two steps back.\" \n» Observations | Recap \nThe Bills don't have a ton of time to get healthy. The team travels to London on Sunday night to prepare for a week of practices and a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Injuries are one thing, but injuries to star players are starting to leave players feeling a bit helpless. \n\"It's like we never have our whole group together,\" running back LeSean McCoy said. \"You know, there's one person out, two people out, and every time we kind of get back together, another injury happens.\" \nThrough six weeks, the Bills haven't been as productive in the running game as they hoped, and the defense hasn't lived up to expectations. Ryan took some offense to the idea that his team is underperforming and didn't hesitate to point to the injury report. \n\"I'll be honest: I thought we'd have been a hell of a lot healthier than we've been for six games,\" Ryan said. \"You know, we've had guys in and out of this roster forever. So we lack some consistency that way. That's not an excuse, it's just a fact.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:59:31.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
