Tons of treatment to be honest with you. I could do it all day,” Tulowitzki said. “But just go out there and play and see what happens.” \nTulowitzki drove in four runs, including three with a homer for his first hit in these playoffs, and the Blue Jays cut their deficit to 2-1 in the best-of-five series. \nThe victory was Toronto’s first in the postseason since Joe Carter’s home run won the 1993 World Series. \nMarco Estrada limited the Rangers to one run and five hits over 6 1-3 innings, with four strikeouts and no walks. \nTulowitzki’s drive to left with two outs in the sixth inning put the Blue Jays up 5-0. \n“It was definitely huge and in the moment I was definitely pumped up. Got back to the dugout and everybody’s obviously excited to put us up by five,” Tulowitzki said. “A little breathing room, I think that’s the goal down 2-0.” \nThat was two innings after he drew a bases-loaded walk. He missed most of the final three weeks of the regular season because of a cracked shoulder blade and bruised muscles in his upper back. \n“Tulo needed that, he really did,” manager John Gibbons said. “He had that long layoff after the injury and then it’s been kind of a battle for him. Maybe that sets him off. … If he catches fire, we’re real dangerous.” \nTexas has another chance Monday to clinch the series at home. If not, a deciding Game 5 will be played Wednesday in Toronto, where the Rangers won the first two games. \nGame 3 came a week after the Rangers clinched the AL West title on the final day of the regular season, in their third chance to do so. \n“We’ve been in this situation before. This is not new to this ballclub,” manager Jeff Banister said. “We knew that Toronto was going to be ready to play today.” \nTexas left-hander Martin Perez, somewhat a surprise pick as the Game 3 starter over veterans Derek Holland and Colby Lewis, gave up four runs and six hits while pitching into the sixth. \nHolland (4-3) starts Game 4 against knuckleballer R.A. Dickey (11-11).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:29:53.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
