(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) \nLONDON (AP) — Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho faces more trouble from the English Football Association after being sent to the stands as the champions’ poor Premier League form worsened on Saturday with a 2-1 loss at West Ham. \nMourinho was red-carded at halftime after Cesc Fabregas had a goal disallowed for offside, moments before Chelsea teammate Nemanja Matic was sent off for a second bookable offence. \nThe Chelsea manager watched the second half from the stands, before leaving his spot eight minutes from the end. His assistant first-team coach, Silvino Louro, was also dismissed, when Matic was red-carded. \nMourinho will almost certainly face repercussions from the FA as the incident follows a suspended sentence from earlier this month. The Portuguese coach was fined 50,000 pounds ($77,000) and given a suspended one-match stadium ban by the FA for comments about referee Robert Madeley following a 3-1 loss at home to Southampton. \nHe did not appear for the news conference after Saturday’s game. \nMauro Zarate gave West Ham the lead before Fabregas thought he had equalized. Gary Cahill then leveled for Chelsea 10 minutes into the second half before Andy Carroll headed the winning goal in the 79th. \n“Cesc’s goal, we thought it was marginal and the second yellow card (for Matic), we thought the referee had carried on (play),” Cahill said. “We don’t feel sorry for ourselves, we can’t. It is just a bit of frustration, it is the way the season is going at the moment. The luck is certainly not with us and we work even harder to turn it around. It is a tough time at the minute.” \nWith defeat leaving Chelsea 15th in the standings on 11 points from 10 matches, bookmakers made Mourinho the second-favorite to be the next Premier League manager to be sacked. \nThe current favorite is Aston Villa’s Tim Sherwood. \nVilla lost its sixth league game in a row in a 2-1 defeat at home to Swansea as the pressure intensified on Sherwood. \nHis side went ahead when Jordan Ayew scored a diving header in the 62nd minute, moments after his brother, Andre Ayew of Swansea, saw a one-on-one chance denied by United States goalkeeper Brad Guzan. \nBut Gylfi Sigrudsson scored a stunning free kick six minutes later before Andre Ayew got the winner three minutes from the end. \n“It is not about me personally, it is about the football club and the players, we are all in it together and we are in a bit of a mess at the moment,” Sherwood said. \nElsewhere, Jamie Vardy took his scoring form to nine goals in seven games as Leicester beat Crystal Palace 1-0. \nNorwich lost 1-0 at home to West Brom and Watford won 2-0 at Stoke.
