What I’d say is drugs like cocaine are cyclical and you’ve hit a cycle where it’s an ‘in’ drug again.\n“I’d be shocked if we’re talking about a couple dozen guys. I don’t want to be naïve here … but if we’re talking more than 20 guys I’d be shocked. Because we don’t test in a comprehensive way, I can’t say.”\nThe NHL regularly tests for performance-enhancing drugs. One third of the 2,400 urine samples collected from players last year were also screened for recreational drugs, like cocaine. Those samples, the report said, showed that the use of cocaine is on the rise.\nDaly said those drugs would be a focus as the league tries to educate its players on the dangers.\nNHLPA union executive director Donald Fehr has reportedly already been making efforts to curb cocaine use amongst the players and plans to address it again with this year’s players, the report said.\nThe NHL has dealt with a rise in cocaine-related player arrests as well. In 2014, Tampa Bay Lightning player Ryan Malone was arrested and charged with cocaine possession. Former Los Angeles Kings player Jarret Stoll was arrested for possession over the summer. \nCocaine use in general is statistically on the rise in North America.\n  This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .\nFiled under bill daly ,  cocaine ,  nhl ,  substance abuse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:17:19.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
