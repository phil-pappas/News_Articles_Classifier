He’s currently in Virginia practicing with the team,” said Jackson’s publicist, Denise White. “He had no knowledge of the incident until a phone call last evening. It’s a legal matter. We’re waiting for police to let us know more about the incident.”\nJackson has denied his involvement with gangs, though his alleged ties to gang members hung over his expulsion by the Eagles last spring .\n“I would like to make it very clear that I am not and never have been part of any gang,” Jackson said at the time. “I am not a gang member, and to speculate and assume that I am involved in such activity off the field is reckless and irresponsible.”\nSources in the TMZ report said one of Jackson’s affiliates staying in the house was the intended target. The intruders had been in the house before, and had cased it for the security cameras.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under desean jackson ,  gangs ,  washington redskins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:12:48.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
