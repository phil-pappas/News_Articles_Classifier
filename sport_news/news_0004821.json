A photo of San Antonio Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge was shown on a background slideshow while CNN anchors discussed Odom's living will, a document that describe's a person's end-of-life medical care. The gaffe was pointed out on Twitter, where reporters from across the country sounded off. \"I hope CNN knows the difference between Lamar Odom and LaMarcus Aldridge but telling by their graphics it seems too difficult a task,\" said Vincent Goodwill, a reporter for CSN Chicago. \"U mmm... @ CNN , that's LaMarcus Aldridge , not Lamar Odom ,\" added Nick Price, a news editor at KUJH-TV. It was one of five photos shown during the segment. The other four were of Odom. Odom, a one-time UNLV recruit was taken to a Las Vegas hospital after he was found unconscious Tuesday night at a Nye County brothel.
