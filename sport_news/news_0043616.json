(Richard Shiro / Associated Press) \nWe have reached the halfway point of a season that has already taken on a half-life of its own. \nWhat the prognosticators never, in a million years, could have seen coming: \n• Both USC coaches are off the job two weeks before Halloween, one fired, the other resigned, on the same day. \nThe University of Southern California dismissed Steve Sarkisian on Monday, a few hours before the the resignation of the University of South Carolina's coach, Steve Spurrier, became known. \nAs news goes, that's like dropping the microphone and walking offstage. \nThe schools have tangled in court over the use of \"USC,\" but never did we think they'd meet like this. \nThe events were equally shocking, in different ways. Pat Haden hasn't had much luck hiring coaches at USC. Ask any Trojans football or basketball fan about that. However, he has become an expert at firing. Too bad Donald Trump no longer has a reality show. Some people still erroneously think Haden is to blame for hiring Lane Kiffin and then setting... (Chris Dufresne) \nIt took something as traumatic as Sarkisian coping with personal demons to imagine he would not be coaching USC's game at Notre Dame. \nAnd who could have guessed his last game as USC coach would come against Washington, the team he left? \nSpurrier is 70, and sort of hinted at retirement after last year's 7-6 finish. Yet, the Head Ball Coach sounded rejuvenated last summer and talked about coaching four or five more years. \nHe joked at Southeastern Conference media days that he was \"the youngest coach in the SEC that's won four straight bowl games.\" \nThen the season happened, and South Carolina fell to 0-4 in SEC play. Spurrier never could stand losing. \nHe poked, prodded and agitated his way through a career in which everyone, and thing, was fair game. \nAbout Georgia he said: \"I sort of always liked playing them that second game because you could always count on them having two or three key players suspended.\" \nHe said FSU stood for \"Free Shoes University\" and once lamented a fire in the Auburn bookstore because \"Twenty of the books hadn't been colored yet.\" \nMost of all, Spurrier could coach. He won one national title, at Florida in 1996, and his Fun 'n' Gun offense revolutionized the stodgy SEC. \nSpurrier was the first to dare suggest offense, not defense, wins championships. He landed at Florida in 1990 and went 122-27-1, winning six SEC titles. After a regrettable two-year detour to the NFL's Washington Redskins, Spurrier went to South Carolina in 2005 and restored pride and victories against Clemson. \nSpurrier is the only coach to have compiled the most career wins at two SEC schools: Florida (122) and South Carolina (86). \n• Iowa (No. 17) ranked ahead of UCLA (No. 18) in the Associated Press media and USA Today coaches' polls. \nIowa finished 7-6 last season under Coach Kirk Ferentz, whose program seemed to have been regressing for years. Yet the Hawkeyes are undefeated, with a win over Wisconsin, and perched ahead of a UCLA team many thought was playoff bound. \n• Michigan State entering as the underdog when it plays at Michigan on Saturday. \nThe Spartans entered the season coming off a major bowl win over Baylor at No. 5 in the AP preseason poll. Michigan was coming off Brady Hoke. \nEveryone thought Michigan would turn around under Jim Harbaugh, but not on a dime, and especially not after getting muscled around in an opening loss at Utah. \n• Florida's national title hopes derailed by starting quarterback Will Grier's testing positive for a banned substance. \nWhat? Who? \nFlorida wasn't supposed to be in the national title chase this season, and Grier didn't even start the season opener. \nThe starter in the opener was Treon Harris, who now steps in for Saturday's trip to Louisiana State. \n\"I really hope people can learn from this and learn from my mistake,\" an emotional Grier said at a news conference. \n• Oregon and USC, the teams picked to win the North and South divisions of the Pac-12 Conference, both have two home losses. \nThe Ducks and the Trojans have gone from preseason No. 7 and No. 8 to unranked. \n• Pac-12 road teams with a 10-5 edge. What happened to home-field advantage? \nThe road wins: UCLA over Arizona, USC over Arizona State, Oregon over Colorado, Stanford over USC, Washington State over Oregon, Utah over Oregon, Washington over USC, Arizona State over UCLA, Stanford over Oregon State, California over Washington. \nOther \"when pigs fly\" moments: \n• Temple is 5-0 for the first time since 1974. That season, the Owls moved to 6-0 with a win over Delaware before losing consecutive games to Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. \nThe Owls' next three games are against Central Florida, East Carolina and Notre Dame. \n• Toledo (5-0) hasn't been this highly ranked (No. 22 in AP and No. 25 by coaches) since finishing No. 22 in the final AP poll of 2001. \nHow high can the Rockets fly? Toledo's highest ranking was No. 12 in the final AP poll of 1970. \nFollow Chris Dufresne on Twitter @DufresneLATimes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:43:47.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
