He’s been here before.\nWith UCLA coming off back-to-back losses to Arizona State and Stanford — losses that have knocked the Bruins down to fourth place in the Pac-12 South — the fourth-year head coach leaned on his experience. He counted all the games he’s had to prepare for over the past two-plus decades, losing track somewhere between 590 and 600.\nBeing around the game that long ensures a few losing streaks. And hopefully for the Bruins, it also built the experience to navigate past them — starting with Thursday’s 6 p.m. kickoff against No. 20 Cal.\n“The important thing is that you don’t rush to the other side of the boat, and start taking on water, then you rush over here,” said Mora, gesturing from side to side. “If you believe in what you’re doing, you do it. You keep trying to do it better, and you make improvements. You get rid of the things that aren’t working and you improve on the things that are working. You try and put your players in the best position you can.\n“But you don’t panic. And we’ve learned that.”\nIt’s worth noting that in that long resume, only 112 games featured Mora as a head coach in either the NFL or college. His three-year stint with the Atlanta Falcons included three losing streaks of at least three games. His lone season with the Seattle Seahawks included two.\nHis body of work at UCLA (4-2, 1-2), however, is more promising. The Bruins’ only losing streak of that length came in 2012, when they ended the season with two losses to Stanford (one in the Pac-12 Championship), and one to Baylor in the Holiday Bowl. Under Mora, they have never lost more than two straight in the regular season.\nThe other side of that coin is that UCLA has now lost back-to-back games in October in three straight years — keeping in line, perhaps, with the need for consistency that Mora so often espouses. In 2013, they fell to Stanford and Oregon by a combined score of 66-24. Last year, Utah and Oregon put up a 72-58 scoring margin over UCLA. And in their last two games, the Bruins fell to the Sun Devils and the Cardinal, 94-58.\nEach time, the losing streak happened after UCLA climbed into the top 10 of The Associated Press poll. Now unranked again, the Bruins need to recapture whatever it was that helped them rebound in the last two seasons, which saw them finish at No. 16 and No. 10 in the final rankings.\nAsked what the key is, Mora cited the need for his players to build a positive attitude while being honest in self-evaluation, to “hang together” in the face of adversity.\n“All those coach cliche things,” he said.\nWorking against the Bruins are mounting injuries, compounded by a coaching staff that has not yet figured out how to tweak its scheme to compensate. Season-ending blows to lineman Eddie Vanderdoes, linebacker Myles Jack and cornerback Fabian Moreau have reduced a once-boisterous defense to a whisper. In their last three games, the Bruins have surrendered 5.5 rushing yards per carry. Extrapolated across an entire season, that number would rank 120th nationally and dead-last in the Pac-12.\nAdvertisement\nThose performances have Mora a bit on edge. During a teleconference on Tuesday, he took issue with a reporter’s assumption that UCLA’s expectations are to win every game.\n“There’s a realism in every season,” Mora said. “The reality changes as the season goes on, based upon who’s playing, and injuries, how you’re playing, momentum — things like that. I think it’s important every day to focus on being the best you can. I think that’s what leads to success.”\nWorking in the Bruins’ favor is, well, belief. Although UCLA has beaten a higher-ranked team just four times since 2012, it has also displayed a knack for performing its best when the bandwagon starts to empty. Mora excels at fostering an us-against-the-world mentality, and that’s instilled these Bruins with conviction — whether warranted or not.\n“We’re confident,” said receiver Jordan Payton. “We’re still confident. We still play hard. That’s one thing we saw on film. We just have to clean the mistakes up. It’s little things that are killing us. We just have to get back to work.”\nAdded running back Paul Perkins: “We all have to carry the team. We need all hands on deck.”\nAbout the Author Reach the author at jack.wang@dailynews.com or follow Jack on Twitter: @thejackwang .\nFull bio and more articles by Jack Wang Back to top", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/thejackwang", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=37", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:12:06.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
