For Middlesex (5-2) it was an afternoon of Coke and smiles. Teammates A.J. Abate, Dan Ffriend and James Esposito each added rushing touchdowns for the Blue Jays, which led 40-0 early in the third quarter. \nKeansburg quarterback Daniel Vital threw three touchdown passes, one each to Arkeyel Brown, Ian Terry and Danny Bauman. \nCoke played running back as a sophomore for the junior-varsity team, then played varsity safety last season. He expected to play mostly safety again in 2015. When Middlesex starting fullback Anthony Marshall broke his leg in a preseason scrimmage in early September, though, Coke got his chance. The 6-foot, 190-pounder has rushed for over 700 yards and 12 touchdowns this season. \nCoke has brought his defensive mentality to running. \n“I like being aggressive,” he said. “When you bring it to them, it makes it a lot harder for them to stop you.” \nHe’s also quickly learned to thank his offensive line and the blocking receivers “so I’m just doing the easy work.” \nThe “easy work” is part of a triple-option attack that keeps defenses off-balance. \n“They just run the thing good, where they’re getting downhill and making the right reads,” said Keansburg head coach John Bird, whose team also runs the offense. “And that’s kind of where we’re hoping to get to because when you can do that it’s a little unstoppable.” \nAt times, especially Coke, Middlesex did seem unstoppable. The Blue Jays scored on their first three possessions to open a 19-0 lead heading into the second quarter. It was Coke and Abate doing most of the damage. On the Blue Jays’ first possession, Coke reeled off a 38-yard run. The six-play drive was capped by Abate’s 1-yard score for a 6-0 Middlesex lead just under two minutes into the game. \nAfter a short Keansburg punt, Middlesex scored in three plays, the drive finished by a nine-yard touchdown run by Coke with 6:27 remaining in the first quarter. Matt Semon kicked the first of his four extra points to give his team the 13-0 lead. Following another Titans punt, Middlesex scored in eight plays. Coke gained 32 yards on three carries, including a two-yard touchdown run with 27 seconds remaining in the quarter for a 19-0 Middlesex advantage. \n“The kids just executed it,” Middlesex head coach P.J. Jankowicz said. “We sort of took what was there and just made some plays. That’s pretty much it. That was one of the last things that we said today, was just we wanted to come out, play hard, play fast. And we did that.” \nKeansburg (1-6) moved the ball at times. Brown had four long kickoff returns, including a touchdown that was called back because of a penalty. Keansburg was missing six starters to injuries, including running back/linebacker Joe Osterbye. Keansburg’s coaches moved Bauman, an offensive lineman, to running back, and the 6-foot, 240-pound senior barreled for 96 yards on 13 carries. \nPerhaps Keansburg’s biggest highlight occurred early in the second quarter. Linebacker George Burdick hit Middlesex’s quarterback as he was throwing, causing the ball to float up in the air. Jared Bell, a 5-foot-11, 275-pound lineman caught the ball for the interception at Middlesex’s 18-yard line. But the Blue Jays, aided by a false start penalty, got the ball back on downs and cruised to the victory. The Titans were able to score three late touchdowns. \n“I’m always happy when our guys play 48 minutes and we did,” Bird said. “They played until the end. … We’re building something and every little step we take we just hope to go in the right direction.” \nKEY PLAY: With five minutes left in the first half, Coke rambled for a 77-yard gain, tackled by Brown at Keansburg’s three-yard line. Dan Ffriend scored the touchdown on the next play, which made it 26-0 and helped put the game out of reach. \nOFFENSIVE GAME BALL: Middlesex’s Ryan Coke had six runs in the double digits, while Keansburg quarterback Daniel Vital threw three touchdown passes. \nDEFENSIVE GAME BALL: Middlesex had a defensive team effort, and Bernal Murillo, Kevin Ambicki, Garry Joaquim were among the Blue Jays with sacks or tackles for losses. \nUP NEXT: Keyport travels to Asbury Park next Friday, while Middlesex goes to Spotswood next Saturday. 11 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1S3mKZL TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:02:22.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
