The Yellow Jackets’ seven straight victories over Nease. Their 50 consecutive wins in district play, a run that dated to Oct. 30, 2003. \nNease is celebrating a district championship thanks to a shoeless quarterback, an untested receiver and an unyielding spirit. \nLeighton Alley’s touchdown pass to Mikey Cotter in overtime capped a stunning comeback and lifted the host Panthers to an unforgettable 23-20 victory over county rival St. Augustine in District 4-6A. \nAfter the Yellow Jackets’ Bradley Meeks kicked a 30-yard field goal on the first possession of overtime, Alley found Cotter in the flat and the senior receiver lunged for the pylon to score the first touchdown of his high school career. \n“That kid just played so hard all year,” Nease coach Tim Krause said. “He blocks, he’s a great teammate, and to be able to make a play like that is just phenomenal.” \nWith four minutes to go, that finish seemed impossible. \nSt. Augustine took a 17-7 lead on a Jahquise Russell 15-yard run, leaving the Panthers (6-2, 3-0) in a 10-point hole and pinned back at their own 20. \nAlley didn’t lose heart. \nThe junior quarterback, playing for part of the drive with only one shoe, marched Nease up the field, capping the possession with a 1-yard sneak. \nSt. Augustine’s EJ Eldridge recovered an onside kick, but the Yellow Jackets failed to run out the clock as Nease used its timeouts and then forced Russell out of bounds on third down, stopping the clock. \nAlley then took over at his own 23, advancing upfield with key passes to Reidar Hubbard and Zach Sheffer before the drive stalled inside the Jackets’ 5. Michael Leisle kicked the field goal to force overtime. \n“I just knew our defense would take them three-and-out,” Alley said. “Once they gave us a shot, we knew we’d make the most of it.” \nThe Yellow Jackets (7-1, 2-1) went ahead early after a miscue when Alley bobbled a snap and St. Augustine defensive end Jacob Jones recovered at the Nease 20. On the next snap, Donald Sapp caught a 20-yard strike to the corner from junior Cole Northrup. \nOne play. One score. That start could have demoralized the Panthers, who had lost their previous two games against St. Augustine by a combined 100-0. \nIt didn’t. \n“We had our backs against the wall early and the kids just kept playing, kept fighting,” Krause said. “They did some crazy things that I don’t think they thought they were capable of.” \nThe durable frame of Kendric Harris carried Nease back into the contest, hitting the line again and again for steady chunks of yardage. \nNease tied the score in the second quarter when a two-yard Harris plunge capped an 80-yard marathon drive that included four conversions on third and fourth down. \nJordan Willis and Tyric Reid led a sterling defensive effort for Nease. St. Augustine’s Connor Evans tallied 17 tackles. \nThe Panthers can make their playoff reservations for the first time since 2008. For today, they’re savoring the moment. \n“That’s everyone’s dream. ... Bartram came close, but we wanted them undefeated. We wanted them not to lose a county game. We wanted to be the ones to stop the streak,” Alley said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:38:50.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
