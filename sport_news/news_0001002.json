After a kickoff that was not returned, 18 seconds ran off the clock. The side judge is in charge of monitoring the game clock, which is kept on the stadium scoreboard.\nVernatchi “will not officiate in Week 6 as a result of the failure to notice that the game clock was incorrectly started,” league spokesman Michael Signora said yesterday. Signora added Vernatchi is being taken off the field for one week and then will return to referee Pete Morelli ’s crew.\nSuch a move is unusual for the NFL, which rarely publicly reprimands game officials. Vernatchi could file a grievance through the officials’ union.\n“The mistake will also impact the evaluation of the other six members of the officiating crew,” Signora said. “Had the side judge or any of the other six on-field officials noticed the timing error, they could have corrected it.”\nSignora said the status of the clock operator in San Diego, an NFL employee, is under review.\nThe NFL also reassigned Greg Wilson , the back judge who missed an end-zone penalty in the final moments of Detroit’s loss at Seattle the previous Monday night. Wilson did not call Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright for batting the ball out of the end zone, and Seattle held on for a 13-10 victory.\nA source said Wilson has been moved off Sunday night’s Patriots-Colts game and will work Dolphins-Titans instead.\nIncluding the mess-up in Seattle, it was the second straight week the NFL acknowledged an officiating error in a nationally televised game, after saying the officials made the wrong call in the Seattle win.\nGiants lose DB\nNew York Giants cornerback Prince Amukamara is going to miss 2-4 weeks because of a chest injury.\nGiants coach Tom Coughlin disclosed the pectoral injury before yesterday’s practice for Monday night’s game at Philadelphia. Amukamara was hurt in the victory over San Francisco. . . .\nA source said the Oakland Raiders plan to put defensive end Justin Tuck on season-ending injured reserve because of a torn pectoral muscle.\nTuck was hurt while trying to tackle Denver running back C.J. Anderson in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s 16-10 loss to the Broncos. He spent the rest of the game on the sidelines wearing a sling. He is expected to undergo surgery soon. . . .\nSt. Louis Rams guard Rodger Saffold will require season-ending surgery for a right shoulder injury. Saffold was the most experienced player on the offensive line, which has two rookie starters.\nAlso, tight end Lance Kendricks underwent surgery for a torn ligament in his finger and is questionable for next weekend’s game against Cleveland. . . .\nTitans rookie outside linebacker Deiontrez Mount will miss the rest of the season after tearing his right ACL at practice on Wednesday in a non-contract drill.\nKelly not interested\nPhiladelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly says he has not heard from Southern California athletic director Pat Haden or any other schools with openings.\nKelly’s name frequently comes up when colleges are looking for head coaches. He was successful at Oregon but has yet to match that in the NFL.\n“I get it. We’re not successful and we’re not winning,” Kelly said. “I came from college, (so) I’m going to go back to college.”\nKelly hopes to become like the Giants’ Tom Coughlin , a former Boston College coach, “where I win enough games that the speculation ends.” . . .\nSeattle Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman was suspended indefinitely by the team after his arrest in a hit-and-run investigation.\nColeman was booked into King County Jail in Seattle early yesterday. Bail was denied until his court appearance today. He was arrested but details were not available. Coleman is being investigated for vehicular assault and felony hit and run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:30:58.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
