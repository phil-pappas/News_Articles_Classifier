He averaged 12.25 yards per carry, ran for a two-point conversion and threw for another two-point conversion as he eclipsed 200 yards rushing for the second consecutive game. Hobbs had 209 yards against Greenbrier the previous week. \n\"When you control the line of scrimmage like that, you'll win some games,\" Farmington Coach Mike Adams said. \nClarksville (1-5, 0-3 5A-West) scored first when Mason Schucker connected with Keonnis Graves for an 18-yard touchdown, but Hobbs took over from there. \nAfter downing the ensuing kickoff on the 12, the Cardinals (3-3, 1-2) gave the ball to Hobbs for the rest of the drive. It took seven plays for Hobbs to cover the full 88 yards, capping the drive with a 13-yard run. Hobbs then broke a tackle on the two-point conversion and got a pass off to Jake Oskey for an 8-7 lead. \nThe Cardinals poured it on from there. \nOskey blocked and recovered a Clarksville punt to set up Farmington at the 29, and Hobbs scored on a 24-yard run two plays later. Farmington then forced a three-and-out, and two plays later Hobbs broke free for a 55-yard touchdown run up the middle. \nClarksville went through another quick three-and-out, and this time Farmington needed only six plays for Hobbs to score again. \nClarksville opened the second drive behind Jason White, who finished with 107 yards, but the drive stalled in the red zone when White was tackled for a 1-yard loss and Schucker was sacked on fourth down by Stephen Piha. \nFarmington set up deep in its own territory, but a couple of holding penalties kept the Cardinals from moving the ball. Facing a third-and-17 situation, Farmington took a shot downfield and it paid off with Brice Waggle connected with Xavier Staten down the middle of the field for an 85-yard touchdown pass. \n\"It was huge,\" Adams said. \"[Clarksville] scored and it was keeping it close, but Staten just did a super job to take it all the way.\" \nGREENBRIER 42, MAUMELLE 40 \nHarold Ross threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Alex Massey with 3:53 left to help Greenbrier (4-2, 3-0 5A-West) hold off host Maumelle (2-4, 1-2). \nRoss completed 10 of 25 passes for 215 yards and 3 touchdowns for the Panthers, who started 1-2 in nonconference play, but have won three consecutive. \nMassey caught three touchdown passes and also returned an interception 97 yards for another score. \nJacob Acklin led the Hornets offensively, rushing for 174 yards and 3 touchdowns on 35 carries. \n5A-SOUTH \nDE QUEEN 42, HOT SPRINGS 7 \nHOT SPRINGS — Cirilo Resendiz’s 170 yards and 4 touchdowns on 11 carries spoiled Hot Springs’ homecoming. Resendiz scored on runs of 52 and 53 yards for De Queen’s final two scores. De Queen (2-4, 1-2 5A-South) rolled to four first-half scores. Drew Dykes completed 9 of 10 first-half passes for 146 yards. Hot Springs (3-3, 0-3) scored on Chris Kinnon’s 3-yard with 14 seconds left in the game. \nCAMDEN FAIRVIEW 51, MAGNOLIA 20 \nCAMDEN — Kevin Franklin rushed for 112 yards and two touchdowns as Camden Fairview (3-3, 2-1 5A-South) beat Magnolia (2-4, 1-2) in a 5A-South conference matchup. Kimonte Wilson rushed for 157 yards and one touchdown, and Raymond Hill finished with two rushing scores. \nSports on 10/10/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:07:36.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
