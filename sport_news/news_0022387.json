It had to be. With less than 8 minutes remaining Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium, the Bears took possession at their 12-yard line facing a two-score deficit with a short-handed offense. The Chiefs led 17-6 and seemed to be administering an inescapable sleeper hold.\nOn the Bears' first nine drives, their offense had given up more points (seven) than it had scored. And with a 26-0 loss in Seattle in Week 3 factored in, they'd tried 19 possessions on the road this season without a touchdown.\nIn that context, it made sense that the upper bowl at Arrowhead had emptied, the parking lots encircling the stadium filling again with people as the Chiefs sauntered toward a pride-saving win.\nWhere was the hope for the Bears? How could there have been any?\nYet for those who stuck around — maybe one-third of whom were Bears fans — the highlights they carried back to the tailgating grounds proved difficult to comprehend.\nTwo Jay Cutler touchdown passes in the final 3 minutes, 5 seconds. A missed 66-yard field-goal attempt by Chiefs kicker Cairo Santos at the final gun. An 18-17 Bears win.\nWait. Really?\nJubilance spread across a cramped visitors locker room. For the second consecutive week, the Bears pulled off a final-minute magic act.\n\"There's a lot of fight in this team,\" Bears guard Matt Slauson declared. \"And we're going to keep on fighting and fighting until the clock says we can't fight anymore. I was so proud of this team for doing that. Because it was tough sledding for a solid three quarters. But nobody panicked or gave up. Which is completely different from the past. We would have packed it in a lot earlier.\"\nOfficially, the Bears went ahead for the first time with 18 seconds left when Cutler found Matt Forte on a 7-yard touchdown toss. Cutler saw what he wanted pre-snap — Forte facing man coverage in the slot from safety Husain Abdullah. And the Bears quarterback knew he'd be throwing that way as long as Forte could successfully loop behind Marquess Wilson on his route.\nYet Cutler dropped a low snap from rookie Hroniss Grasu and had to scoop it off the grass and throw while Chiefs nose tackle Jaye Howard hung from Cutler's calves.\n\"Jay put the ball where only I could get it,\" Forte said.\nA few minutes earlier, Cutler revived the rally efforts with four completions on an 88-yard touchdown march, the last going to Wilson for 22 yards on Cutler's most magnificent throw all day.\nWilson, running a schoolyard corner route, got a step on defensive backs Marcus Peters and Ron Parker. And while Cutler's mechanics were off kilter in the face of a blitz, his throw dropped into Wilson's hands as he crossed the goal line.\n\"Just perfect,\" Wilson acknowledged.\nRight tackle Kyle Long had a more chaotic view.\n\"I'm out there trying to block Justin Houston,\" Long said. \"Which is freakin' hard. But you see the ball's out. And you look up and you just see the ball drop from the sky right into Marquess' hands. I'm looking around like, 'Did anybody else just see that?' \"\nTry to figure it all out, how a Bears offense that averaged 15 net yards on six first-half possessions, managed to chew through 155 yards on its final two drives.\nThe Bears awoke from their lengthy slumber even with two starting receivers (Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal) inactive and two opening-day offensive line starters (Jermon Bushrod and Will Montgomery) out as well.\nAnd Cutler, who appeared anxious in the pocket at times, had to trust a group of young, green receivers to come through — especially late.\n\"I tried not to huddle,\" Cutler admitted. \"I tried to keep them at the line so they're not thinking. Just keep 'em going, keep 'em going, keep 'em going.\"\nRookie Cameron Meredith opened the winning drive with a 20-yard catch. Wilson finished a career day with six grabs and 85 yards while also drawing a pivotal 24-yard pass-interference penalty on the final drive.\nCoach John Fox called Sunday's triumph \"a very gutsy, good football character victory.\"\n\"It comes from inside, man,\" Forte said. \"It's continuing to believe. And if you have all 11 guys that believe in that one thing, then no matter what happens in the game, eventually you're going to have a breakthrough.\"\nSunday's breakthrough proved as heartening as it was improbable.\ndwiederer@tribpub.com\nTwitter @danwiederer\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Matt Forte Kansas City Chiefs Kyle Long Arrowhead Stadium Ron Parker Will Montgomery", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561b12fd/turbine/ct-bears-chiefs-super-sider-spt-1012-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:21:02.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
