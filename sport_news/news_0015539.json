Nikkin Thimmaiah, Akashdeep Singh and SV Sunil continuously attacked the Kiwi 'D' and did not allow hosts' defence to settle down.\nThey were well-supported by midfielders, led by captain Sardar Singh, who covered almost all parts of the field and kept the home side players busy. Dharamvir Singh, who scored the last minute goal in the previous match, SK Uthappa, Devindar Walmiki and Chinglensana Singh would look to continue with their control at the midfield in the final match also.\nNew Zealand will have to prepare themselves better to avoid three defeats in a row.\nSpeaking ahead of the final match, India chief coach Roelant Oltmans said, \"The team is very positive after the consecutive victories against the home side.\n\"I have seen a significant improvement in the boys and they have immensely worked on their strategies and tactics by rectifying their mistakes committed in the first match. Our defence is a huge strength for us and I hope we conclude the final game of the tour on a winning note,\" he said.\nCommenting on his team's preparation, captain Sardar said, \"The team is now more confident after last two wins against the Black Sticks. The aim will be to put pressure on New Zealand from the onset and work on all departments beginning with defence, ball possession and attack.\n\"I hope we continue the winning streak and confront the opponents confidently tomorrow to come up as winners,\" said Sardar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:40:01.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
