The Tigers managed to convert on the next play, an 18-yard pass, and came right back with some up-tempo play a seven-yard run, both by Kerryon Johnson. An 11-yard pass on a later first down was followed by a five-yard loss on a reverse with Marcus Davis, but the Tigers managed to convert on second down again before a one-yard run on first down from the MSU 12-yard line and White was intercepted two plays later. \nA fumble on the opening play doomed Auburn's second drive from the start and its third drive featured a personal foul on a first down. \nEven when Auburn managed to find success on first down during its drive before halftime, with six first downs in 12 plays, a bad snap on third-and-goal kept the Tigers, who missed the ensuing field goal, out of the end zone. \nIn the second half, a penalty following a fumble recovery and a false start on first down slowed another drive. Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee: Sept. 30, 2015 Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee talks to the media after practice Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2015, in Auburn, Ala. (Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) \n\"You can't do that,\" offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee said. \"It's unacceptable.\" \nTo combat predictability of so heavily favoring the run on first down – only LSU's 81.18 percent run plays on first down is higher in the SEC this season – Auburn has tried to get the ball to the perimeter with screen passes. Auburn's 80.8 completion percentage (21 for 26) on first downs is tied for fifth nationally, but due in large part to quick, short passes in an attempt to get a playmaker one-on-one, as Ricardo Louis' 10 receptions for 76 yards, but a long of 13, in the Jacksonville State game illustrates. \n\"If they bring some extra guys into the box,\" Malzahn said, \"if you throw the ball to the perimeter usually that's a good thing. We've done that a few times.\" \nThe lack of up-tempo play is caused in large part due to lack of first down production as well as an enormous drop in success on plays of third-and-10-plus, which though low percentage plays t all levels of football, was an area Auburn excelled the last two seasons. \nHalf of college football couldn't complete more than 50 percent of its passes on third-and-10-plus last season, but Auburn was fifth nationally at 72 percent, up from No. 10 in 2013 at 63.3 percent. Those completions, many resulting in long conversions, gained large chunks of yards and allowed Auburn the opportunity to exploit favorable matchups on ensuing first downs as defenses typically utilize pass-rushing personnel on the defensive line and Nickel and Dime in the secondary in such situations, setting up potential big run plays for Auburn on first down. \nHowever, this season Auburn has converted just once on 15 plays on third-and-10-plus and barely has more completions (three) than interceptions (two) to go with its 27.3 completion percentage (119th nationally) and 22.98 passer efficiency (123rd) on such plays. \n\"It's a fair assessment,\" Lashlee said, \"that a lot of it goes together hand in hand.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:59:54.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
