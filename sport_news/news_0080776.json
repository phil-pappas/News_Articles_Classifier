On Memorial Day, he took off in what police say was a stolen SUV, and got away. Ten days later, a band of APD detectives tracked him to a southwest Albuquerque intersection.\nFrom the get-go, shots were fired by an officer. But it seemed for a moment that cooler heads would prevail.\nThen, detectives tased Gabaldon and fired bean bags at him.\nBut Gabaldon ran again. That’s until police ran him down. Eyewitness video was given to the police.\nThere is also video from behind the wheel. An APD detective who arrived on scene just moments earlier jumped back into his unmarked pickup truck, closed the distance to Gabaldon in six seconds, cranked the wheel to the right, drove up onto the curb - and into Gabaldon. The detective gets out of the truck and runs to Gabaldon.\nHe is unarmed, on the ground, being tased on the back of the head and then struck with the butt of the taser, and then elbowed.The officer even accidentally tases the detective.\nAPD’s spokeswoman said it was an accident, that detective was not trying to run Gabaldon down, but to cut him off. Gabaldon was resisting and that the department’s use-of-force policy speaks for itself.\nThat policy says, “Officers shall use only that force which is reasonably necessary,” and says officers shouldn’t expect suspects to comply without being tased.\nGabaldon is now in jail, charged with crimes from the Memorial Day incident, but not the day he was hit.\nAPD, which refused to release this video for four months, said the case is going to internal affairs.\nCopyright 2015 KRQE via CNN.\n(Source: KRQE, cell phone video, Albuquerque Police)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:23:07.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
