He threw 2 yards to Quenton Bundrage and then 4 yards to Jauan Wesley with 7:47 left to get the Cyclones within 35-20. \n\"When you're down 35-nothing or whatever it was, you don't really think about it,\" Lanning said. \"You've just got to come out and start chipping away at the game. Forget about the score and keep playing.\" \nWhile Corey Coleman had two more touchdown catches, Shock Linwood ran for 171 yards and the Bears stretched their FBS-best home winning streak to 20 games, they were held under 60 points for the first time in six games. \n\"It's hard to stay at a level that we've been at, energy-wise, emotionally and then production-wise,\" coach Art Briles said. \"It's been insane.\" \nThe only other NCAA team with five consecutive 60-point games was Oklahoma in 2008. The Bears (7-0, 4-0) had 485 total yards, leaving them well below their national-leading averages of 64 points and 720 total yards a game. \nIowa State, which has lost its last 14 games against ranked teams, gave up 156 points and 1,882 yards in its last three weeks. But the Cyclones led fourth-ranked TCU 21-14 in the first quarter at home a week earlier before the Horned Frogs scored the game's last 31 points. They opened the stretch losing 66-31 at Texas Tech. \nBaylor finished the game without quarterback Seth Russell, who sustained a strained neck on a 4-yard run without about 5 1/2 minutes left. The extent of the injury wasn't known, though there is extra time before the next game. \n\"He's a tough guy. It's hard to see tough guys hurt,\" coach Art Briles said. \nColeman had a 36-yard score on Baylor's opening drive, then had a downfield block that helped Russell break free on a 37-yard TD run for a quick 14-0 lead. Coleman caught a 12-yarder from Jarrett Stidham in the closing minutes, his FBS-best 18th TD catch this season and the 31st of his career to break Kendall Wright's school record. \nRussell was 16 of 37 for 197 yards and two touchdowns, pushing his FBS-leading total to 29 scores. \n\"We're going to take the blame, but the weather was bad, and we couldn't do lot of stuff we usually do,\" Coleman said. \"It was kind of tough catching the ball. It's kind of hard to play when the ball's waterlogged and (for Russell) to try to throw the ball like a shotput. ... It was an ugly win, but we got it.\" \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:19:47.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
