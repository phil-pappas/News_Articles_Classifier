Daniels and RB Rod Smith, the Seattle Seahawks have reportedly filled the two open spots on their active roster.\nAccording to a tweet from CBS Sports' Rob Rang , Seattle signed free agent cornerback Crezdon Butler -- a move that was first reported on Monday -- and linebacker Nick Moody, who had been on the team's practice squad.\nPete Carroll confirmed the moves when he met with reporters on Wednesday. Both additions will seemingly help add depth to positions weakened by injury.\nButler, a five-year NFL veteran, will compete for playing time at cornerback with Marcus Burley (thumb) and Tye Smith (hip) battling injuries and Tharold Simon (toe) placed on injured reserve. The 6-foot, 183-pounder has 19 combined tackles, two forced fumbles and a pass defensed in 36 career games with Pittsburgh, Arizona, Washington, Buffalo, San Diego and Tampa Bay.\nThe 28-year-old Bulter was a college teammate of former Seahawks cornerback Byron Maxwell at Clemson.\nSeattle signed Moody to their practice squad on Sept. 12 after the 25-year-old was released by the San Francisco 49ers in their final round of cuts a week earlier. The 6-foot-1, 236-pound Florida State alum was a special teams ace with the Niners and had been in the mix to replace the retired Patrick Willis at inside linebacker.\nHis elevation to the active roster could be a sign that Bobby Wagner is likely to miss time after straining a pectoral muscle in Sunday's 27-24 overtime loss at Cincinnati.\nOn Monday, head coach Pete Carroll said he didn't have an update on Wagner's status after the 2014 first-team All-Pro played through the injury versus the Bengals.\nIf Wagner missed Sunday's game versus the 4-0 Carolina Panthers, Seattle would likely start Brock Coyle at middle linebacker or move K.J. Wright over from his usual weakside spot. In the latter case, Moody would provide extra depth outside with Mike Morgan and Kevin Pierre-Louis, who has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury.\nMoody had 25 total tackles in 20 games with the 49ers, including two starts in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:32:12.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
