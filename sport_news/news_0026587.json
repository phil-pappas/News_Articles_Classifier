By PAUL BOGGS Sports Editor The Jackson County Times-Journal \nAs it turns out, there’s no such thing as rest for the wicked. \nIndeed, only a week after defeating previously-unbeaten Logan for their most important victory of the season, the Ironmen are right back at it in another enormous game. \nEven, in fact, a ‘must win’ game. \nSure enough, in the Ironmen’s master plan of clinching not only a playoff spot but also a second consecutive regional quarterfinal home bout, Jackson can’t let its guard down against Meigs. \nIn aiming to avoid a Logan letdown, the Ironmen invade the land of the Meigs Marauders for another important duel on Friday night. \nHow important you ask? \nAnother truckload’s worth of playoff points are at stake. \nKickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. at Meigs High School’s Farmers Bank Stadium, as the Ironmen and Meigs match up for the first time — in the regular season — since 1982. \nBut given the Ironmen’s present position, atop the Ohio High School Athletic Association’s Division III, Region 9 computer ratings at 6-1, it’s actually a ‘must win’ situation, said Jackson head coach Andy Hall. \nThe Marauders are 5-2, and “have had a heck of a season and they have talent.” \nMeigs also has what Jackson wants — another bucket-full of computer points. \nBecause, as Hall discussed in his weekly media interview on Tuesday, anything less than winning out does not guarantee Jackson joining this year’s (Region 9) playoff field. \n“It’s another big week for us, because they have a lot of computer points if we can win,” said Hall. “People look at our computer points and see we’re number one in the region, but the last two teams (Oxford Talawanda and Gallia Academy) on our schedule haven’t won a game. That’s going to hurt us in the long run, and the teams that are behind us have games where they can pick up a lot of points. A loss to Meigs can really hurt our chances of even getting in the playoffs. I told our kids that this is a ‘must win’ in the sense of us controlling our own destiny. At 8-2, that doesn’t guarantee us a playoff berth. We want to control our own destiny and if we win out, we know we’ll be in and hopefully that will be enough to get us a home game.” \nAt regular season’s end, the top eight teams in each region qualify for the playoffs, while the top four teams in each region host first-round home tilts. \nJackson jumped to first following its colossal 35-21 win at Logan, which is a Division II club that enters this week with six wins. \nThe Ironmen are over the century mark in secondary points (101.5), while Zanesville at 90, Hamilton Township at 88 and Columbus DeSales at 76 sit the next highest in Region 9. \nMore points await with a potential triumph over Meigs, which lost at Logan 27-22 in week three before falling 49-34 at Athens a week ago. \nThe loss at Athens marked the Marauders’ first in the competitive Tri-Valley Conference Ohio Division. \n“I wasn’t surprised it (game against Athens) was a shootout, but I didn’t figure it would be that big of a shootout. Meigs has scored on everyone this year including Logan (27-22 loss), but I was surprised they gave up that many points (49),” said Hall. “But we know the Meigs coaching staff is not going to allow that to happen again. They are going to make adjustments, whether it be personnel or scheme or both.” \nMeanwhile, the Ironmen answered each Chieftain touchdown with one of their own last week. \n“That was a big win (at Logan) for us,” said Hall. “The first half was a slug match that had gone back and forth tied at 7-7. In that second half, we set the tone by taking that opening drive, putting the ball in the end zone, getting the lead and making them play from behind. With them having to throw the football as much as they did, it put them in a tough situation. I really liked our emotion, especially on defense. Even in the fourth quarter, when our guys were just dog tired, they showed a lot of emotion when we made big plays. They didn’t quit or lay down. That game was in still in doubt until about the last minute. Every time we got a 14-point lead, Logan scored again. Then we were able to answer. Offensively, we found a grove because we didn’t turn the ball over. When we held onto the ball, we made some big plays. We still had too many penalties and we’re trying to rectify that with technique.” \nAside from 10 penalties for over 100 yards, the Ironmen did suffer key knee injures to two standout performers. \nLinebacker Raymon Potter and cornerback Reagin Conley were injured and did not return, with their status at Meigs — said Hall on Tuesday — currently doubtful. \nPotter is the team’s leading tackler, with Conley a three-year starter in the secondary. \n“Their injuries looked bad on film and looked bad live. Fortunately, they suffered no ligament tears, but their return is a week-to-week situation. We are going to prepare to play without them this week. If they have a chance at the end of the week to give us some minutes, that would be great,” said Hall. “We’re going in this week as if those two kids won’t be able to play.” \nThat will surely test the Ironmen’s defensive depth, which faces — as is often the case —another spread-the-field oriented offense. \nThe Marauders are coached by Mike Bartrum, the former Meigs and Marshall University standout who later played in the National Football League. \nBartrum’s son, Cody, quarterbacks the Marauders, having completed 109-of-223 passes for 1,516 yards and 12 touchdowns. \nHe has also rushed 100 times for 296 yards, as Kaileb Sheets — the transfer back to Meigs from across-the-river Wahama (W. Va.) —leads the Marauder rushers with 487 yards on 81 carries. \nSheets is also the leading receiver with 514 yards on 41 receptions, as he has scored five rushing touchdowns and another five receiving. \nColton Lilly is right behind Sheets, with 34 catches for 509 yards and five scores. \n“The head coach’s (Mike Bartrum) kid Cody Bartrum is the quarterback and he can throw it all over the place. The Sheets kid who transferred back from Wahama is a great athlete. They have size up front,” said Hall. “Cody Bartrum is just a great athlete. He understands the offense and everything revolves around him. If they want to run the football, they put Kaileb Sheets in the backfield and if they want to throw it to him, they put him at wide receiver. He is their main offensive weapon besides Cody, but they also have some other kids they throw the ball to. Colton Lilly, I really like him. I like his toughness and the way he goes up and gets the football. He does a nice job making plays. They have a big offensive line. They are a junior and senior-dominated team. When have upperclassmen like that, you have a chance to be very successful. With a 5-2 record, they’ve shown they can win ballgames. This is a big game for our program moving forward.” \nEspecially for the Ironmen linebackers and secondary, which include Hunter Sexton, Kendall Neal, Austin Leach, Austin Edwards, Johnny Farley and Kyle Kirby. \nCameron Williams, the junior linebacker who missed the first five games due to OHSAA transfer rules along with a torn ACL, was a difference-maker on both sides of the ball at Logan. \n“Meigs will show a lot of trick plays, a lot of reverses, a lot of reverse passes,” said Hall. “They run some really crazy formations that we don’t normally see. We have to be prepared for a lot of different things on defense. But I expect them to throw the football. That’s what their bread-and-butter is and our secondary will be tested again this week. Still, it’s the same formula each and every week with these spread teams. It’s defending in space and tackling in space. This week also, it’s being able to handle field conditions. We’ve had a lot of rain games this year, and this week we’re on grass again. We’ll have to make those adjustments if we need be.” \nHowever, Hall said he is glad his Ironmen are playing Meigs, as the two teams scrimmaged each other for several years, prior to Bartrum and Hall taking their respective reigns. \nJackson leads 8-7 in the all-time series, as the two former Southeastern Ohio Athletic League rivals played every year from 1967 thru 1982. \nThe 1979 game got cancelled, as the Ironmen earned wins in the next three meetings. \nIn 1982, the Marauders left the SEOAL in favor of the TVC. \n“This is a good game that we should be playing. We’re excited about getting Meigs back on the schedule,” said Hall. “It’s an old Southeastern Ohio Athletic League rival and our kids know each other through other sports. We scrimmaged them for years, and I’m good friends with and think the world of (former Meigs head coach) Mike Chancey and his family. Jackson and Meigs have been involved with each other for many years, and a lot of that is through Mike and the people here in Jackson. So there is a lot of familiarity there.” \nAnother Ironmen aspect of familiarity is controlling their own destiny for a playoff berth, which they have a chance to do again against Meigs. \n“You always want to control your own destiny and I think that will be enough motivation for our kids,” said Hall. “We have to keep this thing rolling. Our kids are excited and playing hard and we’re going in the right direction right now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:43:22.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
