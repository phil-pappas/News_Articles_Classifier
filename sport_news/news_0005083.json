NEW YORK JETS (2-1) in London, Sunday, 9:30 a.m., CBS \nDave Hyde Sports Columnist Prediction: Dolphins 20, Jets 17 Comment: There's absolutely no reason to pick the Dolphins other than the fact I'm going to keep doing this until I'm right. The Jets aren't a good team right now, either. They have a talented defense, but a limited offense behind another mediocre-at-best quarterback, just like all the Dolphins opponents to date. \n\nDolphins Writer/Columnist Prediction: Jets 21, Dolphins 20 Comment: The Todd Bowles-led Jets have an aggressive style that the Dolphins typically struggle with, which hints that the offensive line will have issues protecting Ryan Tannehill. If the Dolphins don’t establish a running game, this game won’t be close. The Dolphins need their defense to be dominant, or for Tannehill to play like he did during the Dolphins’ last London trip. \n\nDolphins Writer Prediction: Dolphins 24, Jets 14 Comment: I refuse to believe the Dolphins will fall to 1-3. They’re not that bad. That’s my logic, and I’m sticking to it. \n\nSports Editor Prediction: Dolphins 20, Jets 17 Comment: Tea and crumpets for all. The Dolphins finally get their pass rush going, force a couple turnovers and convince Steve Ross that they should play in London every year. \n\nOnline Sports Editor Prediction: Jets 17, Dolphins 16 Comment: Expect the Jets to put plenty of pressure on Ryan Tannehill, as the Dolphins have struggled picking up blitzes. The Dolphins also have one of the worst running games in the NFL with just 218 yards on the ground and no rushing touchdowns. If the Dolphins can't establish the run, look for the Jets to add to their league-leading 11 takeaways. \nMultimedia Reporter Prediction: Dolphins 24, Jets 9 Comment: Banking on a repeat of last year, when the Dolphins, at 1-2 after two brutal losses, headed to London in Week 4 and destroyed the Oakland Raiders. The Dolphins, following the Bills disaster, face another team with stud, young defensive tackle talent. A loss could pave the way to Miami's third midseason coaching change in the past 12 seasons. \nCBS12 Sports Director Prediction: Jets 20, Dolphins 11 Comment: The Dolphins have a laundry list of issues - rushing offense, rushing defense, rushing the passer, basically any stat that includes the word “rushing” - and I don’t see them fixing them all by Sunday. And the Jets’ defense is beastly. You always have a chance when you’re playing a team with Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback, but I think the Dolphins’ offense will struggle too much to win this game. \n\nHow do you think the Dolphins will fare this week?
