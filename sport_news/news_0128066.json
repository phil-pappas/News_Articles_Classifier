One of the tougher things revolved around his mother.\n“My mom is a drug addict,” Tavin says, almost matter-of-factly. “She’s been in and out of prison. (But) I don’t try to dwell on it. I love my mom.”\nTavin’s mother slipped into drugs not long after his first brother Tristan, now 14, was born. Not long after that, she left. \nHis mom wasn’t the only family member Tavin watched fall victim to drug addiction. Several years ago, drugs took the life of a favorite uncle, dad Brian Montgomery said.\nAt the time, Tavin’s older cousin Jacob Jones was living with the family. When his uncle died from a drug overdose, Tavin and Jones made a decision.\n“At the time, the two of them got together and just vowed not to let that happen to them,” Brian Montgomery said.\nDespite the troubles, the family has seen glimpses of hope. Tavin’s mother cleaned up and the family welcomed her back. For about three years, things went well. She gave birth to two more boys, now 4 and almost 2. But things turned bad again not long after their last child was born.\nBy December 2013, she had relapsed and was out of the house again, said Brian Montgomery, who is raising the four boys himself. \nTavin is focused on football — leading the Rebels to what they hope will be a successful 2015 season, and then starting the next chapter with a college scholarship. Tavin is getting letters, yes. But he has not been contacted by the school he covets most, the Washington Huskies, and so far, Montgomery‘s talent has not translated into a place to play next fall.\n“It’s going to be a hold-your-breath season,” said Steve Montgomery, Tavin’s grandfather and the Voice of Hydroplane Racing. “He doesn’t have an offer from a college yet. People are waiting to see if his knee holds up.”\n“If he played for Skyline or somewhere that threw the ball, he’d have a million offers,” said former Seahawks defensive tackle Sam Adams, who coached a junior team Tavin played on beginning in sixth grade. “He’s got one of the best arms in the area. If somebody gets a hold of him, he’s going to do really well for them.”\nTavin showed promise early. His great grandfather, Bob Blackburn, spotted his talent years before. \n“He was one of the first to tell me he was going to be great,” Steve Montgomery said. \nBlackburn had plenty of first-hand knowledge seeing “special” in athletics. He was the original voice of the Seattle SuperSonics, a post he held until 1992.\nBrian Montgomery, a former Sonics ballboy, played football and basketball in high school, basketball for a year in college, and even once traveled Europe with a youth team coached by legendary Mercer Island coach Ed Pepple.\nBut almost before he could walk, Tavin Montgomery gravitated to football.\n“I’m not sure who Tavin is without football,” Te’o said. “He’s just a football junkie.”\nIt’s been that way since Tavin was 4 years old, when “the ball was bigger than he was,” Brian Montgomery said. Even while chaos, at times, swirled around Tavin and his family, football was a constant.\nA four-year starter, Montgomery has arrived at the moment he’s been working toward for more than a decade. The Rebels are off to a 4-1 start, with a KingCo 2A/3A matchup against Bellevue this Friday.\nMontgomery leads the conference in passing with 900 yards, 11 touchdowns and a 77 percent completion rate. And that’s in four games, since one win came by forfeit. \nThe Montgomerys and Te’o believe interest in him will grow, so long as Tavin continues to show that his knee is healthy. Tavin said that knee is stronger than ever, partially a by-product of adding 22 pounds to his frame during rehab.\n“Tavin turned from a boy into a man over this past year,” Brian Montgomery said of his son’s work to overcome the knee injury.\nMontgomery continues to chase his dream of playing college football despite the ACL injury.\n“My dream is to be a state champion,” Tavin Montgomery said. “I want us to be the best senior class ever. I want to leave the best legacy for Juanita.”\nOnly after that will Montgomery turn his attention to the next challenge. But when he does, one thing is certain. Tavin Montgomery will do so with his family in mind.\nDoug Drowley", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:29:55.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
