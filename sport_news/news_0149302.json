Admission to the ceremony is completely free of charge and open to the public. \nBelow is a list of the 2015 LMU Athletes Hall of Fame class with a note on their accomplishments. There will be a live broadcast of the event for those unable to attend. That video link can be found at www.LMURailsplitters.com. \nRick Byrd - Men's Basketball Coach (1983-86) Despite only spending two seasons on the sidelines for the Lincoln Memorial men's basketball program, Byrd, a native of Nashville, Tennessee, left an indelible mark on the players and fans. \nByrd compiled a 69-28 (.711) overall record during his two seasons with the Railsplitters with a dominant 32-4 (.889) mark in Volunteer State Athletic Conference play. During his tenure with the Railsplitters, Byrd coached the likes of NAIA All-American Keith Brooks, who is ranked second in program history in scoring and field goals, fourth in career scoring average and first in rebounds, and Darrell Cox, who is the school's sixth all-time leader in scoring. \nByrd is entering his 30th season as the men's hoops coach at Belmont University, where he has established a reputation as one of the most successful and respected coaches in the country. He has compiled a 619-312 record with the Bruins, taking his overall head coaching record to 711-367 (.659). Under Byrd's direction, Belmont has reached the postseason in 10 of the last 12 seasons with NCAA Tournament appearances in seven of the past 10 seasons. He ranks seventh among all active NCAA Division I head coaches in career victories. Moreover, Byrd is first among all active NCAA Division I men's basketball head coaches (minimum of 10 years of experience) in terms of percentage of a school's all-time wins, as he has posted nearly 60 percent of Belmont's total all-time victories. \nQuote from Mike Smith, Associate Athletics Director, LMU Class of 1994 and Athletes Hall of Fame committee member: \n\"Coach Rick Byrd stands out to me because he is a rare combination of someone that is obviously a great coach but an even better person. If I had a son, I would be proud to have him play for Coach Byrd.\" \nBrad Froning - Baseball, Basketball and Golf (Class of 1990) Brad Froning is on a short list of student-athletes to have played three sports at Lincoln Memorial University. He was a member of the Railsplitters' 1988-89 basketball team that lost in the NAIA region final, receiving the team's academic award that season. He also competed for the golf team during his junior and senior seasons, but he made his name on the baseball field. \nFroning made an immediate impact for the LMU baseball team as a freshman, ranking fifth in NAIA in triples and 10th in runs scored. As a sophomore, he had 11 stolen bases and led the team with a .369 batting average, earning the aptly-named LMU Thunder Stick Award at the end of the season. Froning received All-Tennessee Valley Athletic Conference first team honors and the team's MVP award as a junior, when he led the Railsplitters in runs, home runs and stolen bases while ranking second in RBI. As a senior, Froning helped lead the Railsplitters to the NAIA playoffs. \nHe graduated from Lincoln Memorial in 1990 with a Bachelor of Science in business. He is the Vice President and Corporate Sale Manage of Emmet Vaughn Lumber Company in Knoxville, Tennessee. \nQuote from Dan Burns, Director of Athletic Development, LMU Class of 1974, Hall of Fame committee member and baseball coach from 1975-87: \n\"Brad Froning was the fiercest competitor I have ever met, including those I played with, played against and coached. Yogi Berra coined the phrase, and Brad Froning lived by it - 'It ain't over till it's over'.\" \nJerry Loftice - Basketball (Class of 1971) Better known as \"Satch\" during his time as a student at Lincoln Memorial University, Jerry Loftice, a resident of Commerce, Georgia, played two seasons of basketball for the Railsplitters. Loftice began his career at nearby Clinch Valley Junior College, now known as the University of Virginia at Wise, before transferring to Lincoln Memorial to play for legendary coach Dean Bailey. \nThe following information about the 6-5 center/forward combo appeared in the March 10, 1971 issue of the Blue & Gray student newspaper: \n\"When Loftice was up for a game, he was a player to strike fear in the hearts of those opposing him. When he was not up he still played better ball than the average player. During his two years with the Railsplitters, Jerry scored 776 points. This past season, he scored 387 points in 24 games. Jerry was also the man in charge of collecting rebounds, and collect he did. All in all this man will be sorely missed by the LMU basketball team.\" \nLoftice received a B.S. in health and physical education from Lincoln Memorial in 1971. \nQuote from Greg Carter, Loftice's teammate and LMU Class of 1971: \n\"Jerry was our Dennis Rodman without the tattoos. When we needed a rebound, Jerry took his big broad shoulders and determination and attacked everything in sight. He always came away with the ball.\" \nQuote from Rick Trivett, Loftice's teammate and LMU Class of 1972: \n\"Adding Jerry to our team was a big part of us winning the Eastern Division VSAC championship. Jerry was an excellent rebounder and defender. He was very physical inside which was what we had been lacking.\" \nKelly Kiser Roberts - Tennis (Classes of 1997 & 2008) A resident of Maryville, Tennessee, Kelly Kiser Roberts played tennis at Lincoln Memorial from 1994-97. She completed her career by being selected to the All-Gulf South Conference first team as a senior. \nWhile playing in the top three flights throughout her entire career, Roberts compiled a 50-32 singles record. In doubles competition, playing mainly in the top flight for all four years, Roberts went 53-23. She is ranked sixth in program history in both singles and doubles victories. \nRoberts earned a B.S. in psychology from Lincoln Memorial in 1997 before returning to earn a Master of Education in guidance and counseling in 2008. \nQuote from Mandy Ray Brassfield, Roberts's teammate and LMU Class of 1996: \n\"What I loved most about being Kelly's teammate was her positive attitude. Whether winning or losing, good day or bad, she always had a smile along with a great attitude. She was such a hard worker on and off the court. This, combined with her work ethic, made us all strive to be better student-athletes.\" \nQuote from Tracy Kennedy Mullins, Roberts's teammate and LMU Class of 1996: \n\"Kelly is from Lebanon, a small town in Southwest Virginia. Southwest Virginia is noted for producing some top-notch athletes, mostly in football and basketball, but Kelly found her niche on the tennis court. Although she excelled in other sports in high school, her fierce competitive nature and ability to dig deep within herself was showcased on the tennis courts. It was the 90s and she played with a style reminiscent of Monica Seles. Natural ability coupled with relentless determination made Kelly a standout in the Gulf South Conference.\" \nHelena Sokolova - Tennis and Cross Country (Class of 2007) Arguably one of the best female athletes to ever represent the Blue and Gray, Helena Sokolova played tennis at Lincoln Memorial from 2004-07 and also ran for the cross country team in 2005 and 2006. \nAn ITA All-American in 2006, Sokolova still holds the career record for singles wins at LMU with 60. He career singles winning percentage of 92.3 percent is the second-best mark in program history. In doubles career history, the Knoxville, Tennessee resident ranks second and fourth all-time respectively with 63 wins and a 78.8 wining percentage. \nShe was a three-time All-Gulf South Conference first team selection (2004, 2005, 2006). She would have undoubtedly been an All-Conference pick in 2007, but Lincoln Memorial was in the midst of a transition to the South Atlantic Conference. She was the 2004 GSC East Freshman of the Year. \nDuring her two-year stint with the cross country program, Sokolova's best finish in a race was 10th place. \nShe received her B.A. in kinesiology from Lincoln Memorial in 2007. \nQuote from Mandy Mills Seal, Sokolova's teammate and LMU Class of 2010 & 2011: \n\"Tennis is a sport of athleticism, strategy, patience and strength, and someone who embodies each of those things is a force to be reckoned with on the tennis court. Helena was a force! When I met Helena my freshman year in 2006, I automatically knew this girl could hit a tennis ball. As the saying goes, 'she may be little, but she is fierce'. Well, that describes Helena to a tee. She fought to win every point, every game, every set and every match. Boy was she successful! It was an absolute honor to play tennis with Helena at Lincoln Memorial University, but it is an even bigger honor to be her friend. Sometimes we only remember people by how many trophies sit on their shelf, but I will remember Helena as a caring teammate and loving friend. I know that Helena continues to be successful every day as a wife, mother and employee. Congratulations on such an honor. There is no one more deserving.\" \nKenneth Woods - Baseball and Basketball (Class of 1978) The 1978 Male Athlete of the Year at Lincoln Memorial, Ken Woods, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, was a standout four-year athlete with the Railsplitters. \nWoods played two seasons of basketball with the Railsplitters, starting for the better half of his freshman season (1974-75) while also playing for the 1975-76 Final Four team as a sophomore. \nAn infielder for the baseball team, Woods completed his career with a lifetime batting average well over .300. The highlight of his career came during his junior season, when he hit a walk-off double against Tennessee Wesleyan to send the Railsplitters into the playoffs. \nAfter graduating from LMU with a B.S. in business administration in 1978, Woods coached baseball and basketball from 1979-2008. He was the 1981 Southeastern Kentucky Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year in 1981 while setting the school record at Pineville High School with 22 wins. That amounted to the largest turnaround in Kentucky basketball history as the team had won just two games the season before. \nQuote from Mark Cartwright, Woods's teammate and LMU Class of 1978: \n\"I am always delighted to hear that a teammate is being inducted into the LMU Hall of Fame, and when it is one of my great friends it's even better. Ken Woods was a gifted athlete who played both basketball and baseball. Ken had a great high school coaching career in Kentucky, raised a family and has touched many lives. His greatest accomplishment is his character and love for humanity. Please join me as we celebrate this joyful occasion for Ken.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:14:53.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
