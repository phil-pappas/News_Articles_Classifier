But by Saturday?\nIt could happen. Everybody's All-American -- especially in Baton Rouge -- comes into Saturday's Eastern Michigan game with 631 yards through his first three games. The Eagles give up an average of 373 rushing yards, worst in the FBS.\nFeel free to do the math. With 369 yards, Fournette would reach 1,000 in only four games, setting an NCAA record.\nMore likely, Fournette gets some rest after piling up a ton of yardage against EMU and ties the record by reaching 1,000 in the season's fifth game on Oct. 10 at South Carolina.\nWe already know LSU's sophomore star is capable. The Tigers can pretty much name their score on Saturday against a run-down program that is close to Michigan only in proximity. (Ever been to Ypsilanti?)\nIndiana's Jordan Howard (675 yards) and San Jose State's Tyler Ervin (641) are both closer to 1,000 yards than Fournette, but they each got there in four games. The competition is also tougher for Howard (Ohio State) and Ervin (Auburn) on Saturday.\nThe rush to a grand boils down to a function to how long coach Les Miles wants to play his star. If not for an 87-yard touchdown run called back last week against Syracuse, Fournette would already have one record in the books -- the SEC single-game rushing mark.\nIf the Tigers get to the College Football Playoff National Championship, the kid could stay on pace and reach 2,944 yards. Yeah, we're looking ahead. So what? LSU RB Leonard Fournette ran all over Syracuse last Saturday.
