Kelly, USA TODAY Sports Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports CLEMSON, S.C. — Of all the impressive things Dabo Swinney has done at Clemson, and the list grows longer with each 10-win season he rings up and tradition-rich program he beats, nothing is more striking than the identity shift he has overseen while remaining nationally relevant and cycling through new groups of highly rated recruits.\nAdChoices When Clemson first broke back into the top 25 under Swinney in 2011, it was a program built on perimeter skill and Chad Morris’ spread offense imported from Texas, and it was good enough to win an ACC title.\nBut when No. 6 Clemson closed out a 24-22 victory against Notre Dame late Saturday night in miserable conditions brought by the remnants of Hurricane Joaquin, it stamped itself as a program finally built to do much more.\nSure, Clemson still employs Morris’ offense (even though Morris is now at SMU) and still has a pipeline of fast receivers out of Florida. But the Tigers are built these days to win in the trenches, which is to say they’re now to be taken seriously as a program and not a gimmick.\n“Listen, our guys have been in games like this and not only been in them but they've won them,” Swinney said. “They expect to win. That’s the biggest change in our program.”\nSure enough, among Clemson’s victims the last four years are Auburn, LSU, Georgia, Ohio State, Oklahoma and now Notre Dame. There is no longer any doubt that Clemson can win games on the biggest stages against the best opponents.\nBut the way in which they beat Notre Dame was validating for the Tigers, even though the game itself was not always a work of art. For all their injuries in September, the Fighting Irish still boast one of the nation’s best defensive fronts and a renowned offensive line. And Clemson won both battles in ways that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.\n“Our guys physically really stepped up to the challenge,” defensive coordinator Brent Venables said.\nIf you’ve watched Clemson’s emergence closely the last few years, two games illustrate how much the program has grown. After winning the ACC title in 2011, Clemson got obliterated in the Orange Bowl by West Virginia 70-33, underlining a late-season fade in which the Tigers gave up more than 30 points in four of their last six games.\nEarly the following season, Clemson went to Florida State and used pretty much every trick in the book to build a 28-14 lead. They created turnovers. They put the Seminoles on their heels with tempo and play-calling wizardry. And it still wasn’t enough, as Florida State’s overwhelming physical advantage eventually produced a 49-37 win.\nThough Clemson could continue to win a lot of games that way, it wasn’t a sustainable model on which to build a national contender.\nBut when you look at the Tigers now, you see the stuff that usually results in consistency and a championship-level foundation.\nClemson ran for 199 yards on Notre Dame, which is even more impressive when you consider that the Tigers got up 14-0 early and went pretty conservative the rest of the way. On the other end, they held Notre Dame’s highly productive running back C.J. Prosise to 50 yards on 15 carries, sacked quarterback DeShone Kizer four times and came up with nine tackles for losses.\n“I thought we really owned the line of scrimmage,” Swinney said Sunday.\nThere really hasn’t been any magic formula to Clemson’s pivot from the flash-and-dash days of Tajh Boyd, Sammy Watkins and Nuke Hopkins to a night like Saturday when it big-boyed one of the big boys.\nThe Tigers recruit, recruit, recruit — starting left tackle Mitch Hyatt, for instance, was a five-star prospect who provided plenty of push as a true freshman Saturday — and have remade their defensive identity under Venables.\nWhereas a number of teams who got ahead of the game with the spread, up-tempo offense have struggled to incorporate the defensive component, Clemson appears to have figured it out. Last year the Tigers were the nation’s No. 1-ranked team in total defense but lost eight starters, sending stars such as Vic Beasley, Corey Crawford, Grady Jarrett and Stephone Anthony to the NFL.\nMany had the idea coming into this season that Clemson would take a significant step back on defense but would make up for it offensively with sophomore quarterback Deshaun Watson and other skill players such as running back Wayne Gallman and receiver Artavis Scott growing into their own.\nInstead, Clemson’s defense has kept right on trucking with guys who played secondary roles last season — such as defensive end Shaq Lawson — emerging as top-level players. It was no coincidence that when Notre Dame lined up for a tying two-point conversion with seen seconds left, they ran the quarterback option away from Lawson, who spent most of the night winning his individual matchup with highly -regarded Irish tackle Ronnie Stanley.\n“Everyone swore we were going to have a huge drop-off and we were going to (stink),” linebacker Ben Boulware said. “They were wrong. We’ve shut down the four teams we’ve played and we’re going to continue to do so. We had the best D-line in the country last year and we have one of the best in the country this year. There’s no drop-off.”\nThough Swinney knows Clemson isn’t as deep defensively as last year, he is not surprised by its production, which ranks 12th nationally in scoring defense (14.8 ppg) and is allowing just 3.05 yards per rush. That depth may have been a problem in the fourth quarter — Clemson looked a little tired as Notre Dame came back from a 21-3 deficit to nearly tie the game -- but this was a victory that will set the Tigers up to make a run at the College Football Playoff if they can keep duplicating the recipe of running the ball, stopping the run and limiting turnovers.\nThat’s a far cry from the Clemson of just three years ago.\n“There’s nothing I’ve seen that I didn’t expect and talk about in the preseason,” Swinney said. “We haven’t even come close to playing our best football.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:47:24.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
