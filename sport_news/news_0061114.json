But in the meantime, Mets players want “The Belt.”\nThis season, outfielder Michael Cuddyer began bestowing a WWE-style belt to each game’s most valuable player.\n“Guys look forward to it at the end of the game,” Cuddyer told Post reporter Mike Puma in June . “I just pick somebody whether they had the best game or biggest impact.”\nThe Belt was designed for the team by an online company with the Mets logo and colors. Cuddyer alone decides who gets it.\n“I’m always kind of thinking about it and obviously when the game is over, I’ve got to make a pretty quick decision,” he said.\nRight after The Post revealed the Belt, the Mets went on a seven-game losing streak, but Cuddyer laughed off the suggestion it might be jinxed: “I promise, we’ll be giving out the belt again this season.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under michael cuddyer ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:12:34.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
