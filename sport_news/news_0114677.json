The scandal prompted the resignation of longtime CEO Martin Winterkorn, and Mueller - previously head of the Porsche division - was appointed Sept. 25 to succeed him.\nChief employee representative Bernd Osterloh is also expected to address Tuesday's meeting - a previously scheduled gathering that has taken on added urgency since news of the scandal broke. Officials said it would be closed to the media.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
