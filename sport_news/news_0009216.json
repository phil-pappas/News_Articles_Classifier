Assistant coach Billy Phillips said Relyea missed the game because “he’s having problems with his Achilles tendons.” \nHighland led 7-6 at halftime, receiving its score on a touchdown carry by Mike Malheiro. In the second half, the Huskies added four more touchdowns. Quarterback Mike Doxey passed for a touchdown and rushed for a touchdown, while Paul Hansut caught two touchdown passes. \n“We came together in the second half and really played well,” Phillips said. “I think (the difference) was a confidence boost; us settling down, getting together and talking to the team (at halftime) calmed them down.” \nPhillips also praised the play of Doxey, who hasn’t seen a lot of time at the quarterback position. \n“We’ve been shuffling kids around in different spots,” Phillips added. “It was a tough spot for him (Doxey) because he doesn’t get a lot of reps at quarterback. He stepped up and did real well.” \nHighland (2-6) receives a bowl game next week against an opponent yet to be determined. \nA.J.
