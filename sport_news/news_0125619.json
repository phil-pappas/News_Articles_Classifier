No respect. I am not speaking about football. Football I will expect every type of critic, even the stupid ones. \n“But private life and stupid things that you bring to the light….. I don’t like it, so we go to a different level of professional relations.” \nAnd when asked if Eden Hazard will start against West Ham, after he came off the bench against Aston Villa, Mourinho said: \n“I don’t know, I don’t have to answer you. Lots of people with an opinion have been speaking about him I prefer not to individualize. I am happy with his contribution against Dynamo and that’s it.” \nMourinho, however, says he has seen an improvement from his players in the last two games. \n“The victory against Aston Villa was a very good result an the draw against Dynamo was a positive result,” he says. \n“We could feel some individual performances. One example: Matic went from being on the bench against Villa to being man of the match for UEFA three days later. \n“But other players also improve.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:09:43.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
