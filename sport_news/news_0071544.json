She started running after recovering from surgery in preparation for the 1995 Dallas Race for the Cure.\nOn Saturday, Clift finished the 5K in 31 minutes, 30 seconds. She finished among the top 10 fastest survivors and unofficially placed first among the women over 70.\nOfficially, there were no age group awards for the second consecutive year.\n\"You like to know where you fall within your age group,\" Clift said. \"If you're competitive at all, it means something to you. It would be neat if they bring it back.\"\nThe Dallas County affiliate of the Susan G. Komen had several changes in leadership over the last year. Chris Packard, the interim executive director, stepped in to help make sure Saturday's race came off.\n\"With the change in leadership, there were a lot of activities that needed attention,\" he said. \"The attention was on the overall participation and survivor experience. We have every intention of having age group awards next year. We understand the value it provides our loyal Dallas runners.\"\nFrankmann, 31, placed fourth overall among women in 18:35. She would have won her age group, but she didn't care.\nFrankman said she races this event every year in honor of her mother, a breast cancer survivor, and in memory of her grandmother, who died from the disease.\nOn Saturday, she used the 5K as a tempo run in the middle of her marathon buildup for the Dec. 6 California International Marathon. She has run multiple 100-mile weeks.\n\"It wasn't the significant race it has been,\" she said. \"It was very different than years past. If that was just communicated more to the racing community, all would have been fine.\"\nShe said she thought Komen wanted to focus on the charity side, not the race side. She said she will continue to support the race and its cause regardless of how it handles timed runners.\n\"Komen is a significant organization for me,\" she said. \"I have the desire to support it.\"\nPackard said the event is on track to meet its $1.2 million fundraising goal. Participants have until Nov. 13 to turn in funds.\nDallas 13.1: Saturday's Michelob Ultra 13.1 Dallas Half Marathon and Life Time 5K will have a combined field of more than 2,000 runners.
