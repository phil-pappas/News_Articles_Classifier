After all, there were 81 points scored and 143 offensive plays run.\nBuy this photo Greg Latushko was one of five different Ramapo players to score in its win over Indian Hills on Friday. Latushko was one of five different Ramapo players to find the end zone in his team’s 49-32 win, the Green Raiders’ fourth straight overall and eighth in a row head-to-head against their intra-district rival.\nIndian Hills fell behind, 21-6, and rallied for two touchdowns late in the first half to pull within two.\nRamapo (5-1), the No. 6 team in The Record public Top 20, countered by scoring on its first three drives in the second half to open up some breathing room.\n“At halftime, the coaches gave us a good speech, and we came out tougher,” Latushko said. “We made some changes and were able to create some turnovers.”\nThe specifics of the pep talk remain a mystery – the senior receiver/cornerback “was so in the zone, I don’t remember all of it” – but there were no secrets when it came to the teams’ fast-paced style of play.\n“We knew that their offense was almost exactly like ours, and they gave a good fight,” said Latushko, who caught touchdown passes of 30 and 15 yards from Keith Woetzel.\nThe second of those two scores gave the Green Raiders a 35-25 lead. No. 13 Indian Hills (4-2) took the ensuing drive into Ramapo territory, aided by a personal foul penalty on a fake punt pass that fell incomplete.\nThree plays later, Woetzel forced a fumble that senior linebacker Jack Allen recovered, and the Raiders capitalized when Ryan Curtiss took a sweep 9 yards to give them a 42-25 edge.\n“That [fumble recovery] was a good play at a good time,” Allen said. “Woetzel made a heck of a play, and I’m just glad I was able to get the ball.”\nAllen also centers the Ramapo offensive line, which helped move the Ramapo ground game to the tune of 285 yards rushing. Woetzel carried 13 times for 195 yards and two scores, and Joe O’Hagan ran 19 times for 80 yards and a touchdown.\nSenior Jack Schofield added a 15-yard TD catch, and two-way linemen Chris Ditomasso and Brian Raguseo had a sack apiece.\nThe Green Raiders will look to continue climbing the North 1, Group 3 power point standings when they host West Milford next week.\nIndian Hills returns home to face Tenafly off of two straight losses, albeit against two of the top six teams in The Record Top 20.\n“We played Old Tappan and Ramapo in back-to-back weeks, and I think we got better even with losing those two games,” Braves coach Joe Sabella said.\nIndian Hills quarterback Tim O’Brien completed passes to seven different receivers, finishing 23-of-45 for 311 yards with four TDs and one interception. Derek Anderson was his favorite target with six catches for 192 yards and touchdowns of 57 and 77 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:54:40.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
