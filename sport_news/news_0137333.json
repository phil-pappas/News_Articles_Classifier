The cracker, which was kept as a souvenir by James Fenwick, a passenger on board SS Carpathia which helped rescue some of the Titanic’s passengers, was stored by him in a Kodak photographic envelope with an original note which read “Pilot biscuit from Titanic lifeboat 1912”. The Spillers and Bakers pilot biscuit – a type of cracker made from flour and water – survived the sinking of the Titanic on April 15. “It is the world’s most valuable biscuit,” Andrew Aldridge from Henry Aldridge & Son auctioneers in Wiltshire, UK said. “It is incredible that this biscuit has survived such a dramatic event — the sinking of the world’s largest ocean liner — costing 1,500 lives,” he added. The cracker, which will go under the hammer on October 24, was part of a survival kit stored within one of the ill- fated ocean liner’s lifeboats, the Mirror reported. It is estimated to fetch between 8,000 and 10,000 pounds. The biscuit will be sold alongside the Fenwick archive - a unique photographic history of the rescue of the survivors from the Titanic. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:45:38.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
