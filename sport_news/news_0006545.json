By Jacob Thorpe The Spokesman-Review \nPULLMAN — It has been said that the Washington State football program lost its innocence when it hired Mike Leach in 2012. Now it’s lost its anonymity, too. \nThree-and-a-half years down the line, here is the dividend on WSU’s investment: The Cougars are about to play a nationally-televised game in late October with pole position in the Pac-12 North at stake. \nIf the Cougars (5-2, 3-1 Pac-12) can topple No. 10 Stanford (6-1, 5-0) on Halloween Night in Pullman, the Cardinal will still be a half-game ahead in the conference standings. But each team would have just one conference loss, and the Cougars would own the tiebreaker. SATURDAY \nStanford @ Washington State, 7:30 p.m., ESPN \nWin this weekend’s ESPN game and the road to the Pac-12 title will go through Pullman. There might be concern of a letdown after winning three straight, but the players say otherwise.
