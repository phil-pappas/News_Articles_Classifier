Three plays later, Theissen found Hunter Trinidad for the first score of the game on an 8-yard scoring strike to the front of the end zone.\nTheissen scored on a 1-yard run to start the second quarter to put the Jaguars up before Roosevelt could answer.\nRoosevelt started the season with two wins after going winless in 2014 but have been unable to win since and have dropped its second straight district contest.\nThe Rough Riders did tighten up their defense in the second half, limiting Johnson to 16 passing yards. But two costly turnovers in the game cost them any chance to catch the Jaguars.\nRoosevelt quaterback, Bryson Carroll , finished the night with 181 yards rushing on 15 carries to lead the Rough Riders.\nHe also passed for 93 yards.\nsports@express-news.net", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:25:39.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
