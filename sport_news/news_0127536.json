If we play the best down the stretch, then we could be the best. But there’s a big difference there, I think.” \nThe Hall of Fame coach – who said he didn’t care when the ’09 squad was the first ever unanimous AP No. 1 team because he knew they were the best – is still waiting to see what this year’s team can do. Very simply, they’ve got to see if the talent and the experience translate into the court. \nUNC, which welcomes just two freshman this year and returns its core and its starters from last season, has played through enough situations that it feels that experience should carry over. \n“It’s a big thing, I think it’s key,” senior Joel James said. “There’re so many situations that happen in a game that, if you’re a freshman or if you haven’t played that much for three years, if you’re not experienced in it, you can get caught up in what’s happening. But because we’re such experienced guys, I feel like we’ve seen a lot of things on the court and it’ll just help us in all game situations.” \nThe team has lived and learned from its mistakes – pointing clearly to the games from the 2014-2015 season in which it lost first-half leads because of errors or lack of effort. \n“Last year we had the lead eight times in the first half and then things shut off,” Williams said. “A lot of that is toughness. It’s not who’s going to stand up and fight somebody, it’s just doing the simple things, little things that you’re supposed to do. Remembering things you’re supposed to do, taking care of all your business, touching every base, that’s something we’ve got to improve on in every area. That’s something we’ve discussed over the summer and touched on in the first six practices.” \nNorth Carolina has those eight games – the halftime score, the point differential and the final score – posted in its locker room and weight room as a reminder of what happens when the details are neglected. The repetition of the consequences of blown details is as important, players say, as playing through the experience a few times too. \n“We just have to go out there and just do what (coach) tells (us) to do – get away from the defensive let downs, get away from not boxing out,” senior Brice Johnson said. “It’s a proven fact that when we do those things, we’re a better team. We win more games when we do the little things that he preaches.” \nJohnson recognizes the deeper level of understanding those details in his fourth year, even though the repetitive concept is nothing new. \n“Over and over, he points you out, slows it down, goes over it three or four times,” Johnson said. “There were games where we lost a game because we missed a box out. He’s going to show you where your mistakes were and if it’s significant, he’s going to show them over and over. It’s going to hurt but it’s the truth and you just have to take it.” \nThe Tar Heels on this roster have taken it and they’re heeding the knowledge. \n“After you’ve been through it a couple times, it becomes almost like second nature,” senior Marcus Paige said. “Experience and older teams definitely have an advantage as long as they’re still talented.” \nAnd the team believes this season they are definitely still talented. The loss of JP Tokoto is a blow to the Tar Heels defense – the forward forced a team-high 85 turnovers last season – but in general, the team has gotten better player-by-player in more ways than it lost anything from last season. \nSophomores Theo Pinson, Joel Berry II and Justin Jackson all say they’re more comfortable and their peers say the confidence shows in practice – “It’s hard to come in as a freshman and be that guy,” Paige explains, understanding the learning curve. The junior class – Nate Britt, Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah in particular – also feels it has its feet firmly beneath it now. \n“The first two years here are always the toughest,” Hicks said. “Junior and senior year is probably better. Just having those two years down is probably the help needed.” \nAcross position and class, this year’s team is an older and improved version of the Sweet Sixteen squad from last season and the hope is that the maturity translates into being able to finish in game circumstances like those eight in which leads were blown. \nThe difference of the outcome translates to earning the record to be a national No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the tournament and in advancing to another weekend of the tournament, the team understands. It’s a comprehensive understanding that the little things translate to the biggest results. \n“This team has talent and experience and we did last year,” Paige said. “But this year I feel like our core guys that were freshman aren’t freshman anymore so that kind of helps. And everybody else is a little bit better too.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:49:14.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
