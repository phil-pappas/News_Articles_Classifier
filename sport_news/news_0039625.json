Some have had them in their first two. We're 2-1 and played well enough to win two and didn't play well enough here,” said Jets head coach Paul Maurice. “We do a good job of not sugar-coating things or sweeping things under the rug. We weren't quick enough today to have an opportunity to win the game.\n“We'll move on to the next one. We deal with our problems and our issues directly and quickly. I'm not being casual about the loss, but the fact that we had one doesn't shock me.”\nNo, Maurice didn't expect his group to go 82-0 this season and the truth is he probably didn't envision a scenario where this group was even going to sweep this four-game road trip to start the season.\nIt's not the loss that is going to bother Maurice, but some of the factors that contributed to it.\nDiscipline was a concern, beginning in the first period when the Jets had a parade to the penalty box, taking five minors and finding themselves shorthanded on four separate occasions.\nSure, there was at least one and probably two head-scratchers handed out by the men in stripes (an interference call on Nikolaj Ehlers on a faceoff play and a roughing call against Ben Chiarot immediately stand out), there were a couple of others that were avoidable.\n“We spent too (much) time in the penalty box and it cost us energy to play five-on-five,” said Jets goalie Ondrej Pavelec, who made 40 saves and was outstanding. “It was too many penalties.”\nThat Islanders power play struck twice, including a back-breaking goal from Ryan Strome with 11.8 seconds left in the first period after a Kyle Okposo shot caromed off the end boards and landed right on Strome's stick.\nJohn Tavares paced the attack with a goal and two assists, though he was stopped on a penalty shot with 2:15 left in the third period.\nBrock Nelson had the other goal for the Islanders, who improved to 1-2.\nThe Jets got goals from Mark Scheifele (his third) and Dustin Byfuglien, who scored on the power play before leaving the game with an apparent injury to his right leg.\nIt's a new season, but it's up to the Jets to make sure the trend doesn't continue and become a bad habit – like it did too often last season.\n“Hopefully it was just an isolated incident and it was just (Monday),” said Jets centre Bryan Little. “For the most part we’ve been pretty disciplined for the first two games. A bit of it had to do with how much we were chasing the puck and how much puck possession they had. I mean, they’re going to take a lot of penalties when you have to haul guys down on breakaways and 2-on-1s and stuff like that. It was a bit undisciplined and it was a bit chasing the puck all (game).”\nSpeaking of potential trends that can't continue, the Jets have come out flat in two of three games this season.\nThe skating legs just weren't there and that high-paced physical style was nowhere to be found, at least until later in the game when the Jets found themselves in striking distance.\nThe Jets faced a similar problem in their season opener against the Boston Bruins.\n“I can’t really explain it,” said Little. “That’s been two games out of the three this year where we’ve come out a little flat. It’s tough to put my finger on. I don’t know if we were just a little comfortable at winning the first two games, but we came out flat and they came out hungry and ready to play. It wasn’t an easy (game) for us.”\nAnd according to captain Andrew Ladd, it shouldn't be a game to be simply swept under the rug either as they prepare to face the 3-0 New York Rangers on Tuesday.\n“They were just ready and we weren't,” said Ladd, who went on to discuss what the Jets need to do in order to bounce-back from their first loss. “Getting a little angry at how it went. We have a group in here that understands there's a lot more to give in a lot of different areas.”\nPavelec prevents greater loss\nThere was only one reason the Winnipeg Jets weren't blown out on Monday afternoon and his name is Ondrej Pavelec.\nThe Jets' netminder was under siege early, making 15 saves in the opening period and finishing with 40 overall, as the Jets fell 4-2 to the New York Islanders at Barclays Center.\n“Our goaltender stood on his head and if he didn't, it would have been a completely different scenario,” Jets captain Andrew Ladd said matter-of-factly.\nThis was the second time in three games the Jets came out flat and could have easily found themselves with a larger deficit after 20 minutes of play.\n“(Pavelec) kept us in it and we were lucky to be down just by one after the first,” said Jets centre Bryan Little. “I’m not sure how many shots they ended up with, (it was 44, one into the empty net) but that definitely wasn’t the goalie’s fault we lost.”\nPavelec has made two starts this season and while it's obviously a small sample size, his often-discussed numbers are still strong, as he's 1-1 with a 2.52 goals against average and .932 save percentage.\nThe Jets are back in action on Tuesday against the New York Rangers to close out the four-game road trip and it's not clear whether Pavelec will be back between the pipes or if Michael Hutchinson will be tapped on the shoulder to make his second start of the season.\nken.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter: @WiebeSunSports\nJets fall flat against Islanders\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 04:05 PM EDT | Updated: Monday, October 12, 2015 07:28 PM EDT\n BROOKLYN – One team looked like it was desperate after dropping consecutive games to the defending Stanley Cup champions to open the season.\nThe other?\nWell, it looked like they left their legs in New Jersey, hanging goalie Ondrej Pavelec out to dry for much of the contest as they fell 4-2 to the New York\nIslanders on Monday afternoon at Barclays Center.\nIslanders captain John Tavares was key in the offensive attack with a goal and two assists.\nThe Jets are back in action at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night against the New York Rangers (3-0), as they close out a four-game road trip.\nMuch like they did against the Boston Bruins in the opening game of the season, the Jets came out flat, only this time discipline was a considerable\nissue, as they started a parade to the penalty box – a theme that was all too common last season.\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Blue Jays complete comeback in crazy Game 5 win over Rangers\n0\nLittle oversight over city's LTD claims\n0\nHazel McCallion slams Harper in Liberal ad\n0\nTFC clinches first-ever post-season berth\n0\n‘Shy Tories’ among poll oddities\n0\nTFC clinches first-ever post-season berth\n0\nJays, fans make statement with Game 5 win\n0\nLamar Odom on life support after being found in brothel\n0\nBlue Jays complete comeback in crazy Game 5 win over Rangers\n0\nIowa teacher takes his 'McDonald's diet' to schools, irking critics\n0\nWhitby Crash\nNorth Korean Yeonmi Park's View of Canadian Freedoms\nParking enforcement blitz in Toronto\nPredictions for the Jays in ALDS\nBlue Jays playoff excitement unprecedented\nMore from Hockey Babcock\n'Personal reasons'?
