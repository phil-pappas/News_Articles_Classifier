Their builds and speed are unique. \nOne might even be a different kind of quarterback. See where this is going? \nThe fact is, there likely is an advantage if, say, a certain Indianapolis-based organization withholds information about a certain Pro Bowler as long as possible . Like, say, until someone snaps a chin strap just prior to the Colts' first offensive play tonight. \n\"Guys will say (secrecy) is gamesmanship, but football at the NFL level is a very sophisticated game,\" former Colts coach Rick Venturi said today. \"It's a game of matchups, physicality and scheme, and that's why coaches bend the envelope to gain an advantage.\" \nReporters from the NFL Network and ESPN posted morning tweets saying Andrew Luck will throw passes in pre-game but will not play . \nUntil it's known for sure, the opponent in Houston must wonder how the visiting team with a quarterback mystery plans to attack. Clearly, an offense will be more productive with Luck than backup Matt Hasselbeck, who has been ill this week, or recently signed third-stringer Josh Johnson. \n(Who is Josh Johnson, by the way? Answer: The Oakland native was a brief starter in Tampa Bay -- four games in 2009 -- making an appearance in only three NFL games over the past four seasons. The Colts hope he's just insurance. Or a clipboard holder. Or someone to catch long snaps from Matt Overton when he wants to warm up.) 5 storylines: Luck out; Andre Johnson returns to Houston \nAt any rate, regulating the flow of information is what sports teams do, especially when the player(s) in question means as much to the flow of the game as Luck does. It seems so simple. It would be called gaining a competitive advantage if the team wasn't already disadvantaged by its player being banged up in the first place. \nAs an aside, the Colts have kept information about Pro Bowl cornerback Vontae Davis (foot) on the down low, too. Like Luck, his availability surely impacts what the Texans do in tonight's game (8:25 p.m., WTTV-4, NFL Network). \nAs seems obvious, Venturi said there's a difference between Luck, Hasselbeck and obviously Johnson, and the Texans will approach all aspects of the game depending on which Colt plays. \n\"If (the opponent) knows who's playing early in the week or middle of the week, it can adapt the amount of repetitions and emphasis placed on the game plan,\" Venturi said. \"If I know Andrew's arm is 80 percent and he can't throw the deep fade or the deep ball, I'm going to play more Cover-2 or (single) press (coverage). I'm going to do things that sit on (receivers). \n\"If I know Hasselbeck is playing – he's a quicker-rhythm quarterback – I know I'm going to get a dink-and-dime team, a West Coast offense, and I'm going to play certain coverages that match that. In layman's terms, we're going to sit on the short routes.\" Doyel: Andrew Luck and the magical mystery Colts offense \nVenturi said a defensive's rush plan also changes with the type of quarterback playing. With Hasselbeck, the emphasis will be on forcing the ball out quick without concern for him running. Luck is one of the best running quarterbacks in the league. It's a defensive give and take. \nMaybe this is a case where the Colts just didn't know how Luck's right shoulder feels, and there couldn't be a final reading until just gameday. All week there's been a public back and forth about the level of soreness he has and how it was achieved. Fox59's Chris Hagan was the first to report concerns for subluxation, and that sent people scrambling for the definition. Turns out it's different than a separation, which might have required a procedure. \n\"Subluxation is obviously much better than a dislocation and portends a much better prognosis to return to play,\" said Dr. Scott Lintner, a shoulder specialist at OrthoIndy who has not examined Luck. \"But man, you've got to be 100 percent and the concern isn't that you won't get over it, it's that it's going to happen again.\" \nGames? Just playing it safe? The Colts will show their hand – or at least something related to the status of Luck's very important right shoulder -- tonight. The inactive list will be released just prior to 7 p.m. \n\"I couldn't even give it to you,\" Venturi said of a prediction. \"If they didn't re-sign that kid (Johnson), then I say it's a slam-dunk that (Luck) plays. That totally put it in turmoil for me.\" \nFollow Curt Cavin on Facebook or Twitter: @curtcavin 1 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1Lk1kX9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:33:53.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
