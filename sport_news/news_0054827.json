New York Giants tight end Daniel Fells will reportedly never play football again, and it sounds as though he is fortunate to be alive.\nAdChoices According to Jason Cole of Bleacher Report, Fells has already had five procedures on his foot in an attempt to fight off a MRSA infection. One of the surgeries involved removing a portion of the 32-year-old’s foot, which has put an end to his NFL career.\nHowever, football is likely the furthest thing from Fells’ mind at the moment.\n“Doctors have, in fact, advised Fells that he may lose the foot to avoid a blood infection that would go throughout his body,” Cole reported. “At this point in time, Fells career is over. He will never play football again.”\nCole added that Fells is in “good shape” at the moment but that the infection was considered life-threatening at one point. He will remain in the hospital and continue to receive antibiotics, which can hopefully save the remainder of his foot.\nAstonishingly, Fells is the second Giants player to lose a part of his body this season. Though, it doesn’t sound like Jason Pierre-Paul’s life was ever in danger despite photos showing he suffered a pretty gruesome injury .\nOur thoughts are with Fells and we hope he is able to make a full recovery.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2578373-insider-buzz-fells-infection-could-be-life-threatening-nfl-career-is-over", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/jason-pierre-paul-hand-pictures/274301", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:49:33.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
