(Photo: Karen Fucito/Correspondent) 49 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMORRISTOWN - On the opening kickoff Saturday afternoon, West Morris fumbled the ball away to Morristown. \nThe Wolfpack didn't do many other things wrong for the rest of the day. \nWest Morris' defense held and then the Wolfpack poured it on throughout the first half on the way to a 34-7 victory in the NJAC-National. \nIf ever there was a mid-October game with playoff implications, this was it, since each team needed a win to keep its playoff hope alive. \n\"Coach (Kevin) Hennelly emphasized that this was as close to a playoff game as you are going to get,\" West Morris running back Cole Draghi said. \nThe 5-foot-8, 170-pound Draghi might be one of the smallest of the Wolfpack, but he had a huge impact on the game. He rushed 14 times for 184 yards and scored the game's first touchdown. \n\"What makes him good is that he has good vision and he runs hard,\" Hennelly said. \"He's not one of the biggest kids that we've ever had, but he's patient and he gets the (yards after contact).\" \nDraghi grew up watching former standout West Morris running backs Michael Burton and Shane Thompson and wanted to be just like them. The junior is making the same impact with the ball that they did. \n\"I like how they were physical,\" Draghi said. \"I just try and keep my legs moving.\" \nWolfpack blockers Dominic Grauso, Pat Egan, Erik Henwood, Rourke Colligan, Will Modla, Tyler Miller, Tom Galayda and Thomas Pellegrino, gave Draghi plenty of room to operate. \n\"It may have been our line's best game,\" Hennelly said. \nAfter Morristown's Ethan Bolson missed a 46-yard field goal four minutes into the game, West Morris went 80 yards in 11 plays, with Draghi going in from 2 yards out and Pat Egan making the first of four extra points. Draghi's 33-yard run spearheaded the drive early on. \nOn Morristown's first play from scrimmage after touchdown, West Morris linebacker Camero Beltram — making his first varsity start — intercepted a pass and returned it 5 yards to Colonials 24. But Beltram turned his ankle on the play and did not return. \nA short time later, Draghi ran for 18 yards, setting up quarterback Cooper Sloan's 1-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Pruss. \nThe rout was just beginning. The teams traded possessions before West Morris struck again, this time when Bryce Sokolowski went in from 3 yards out to end a 50-yard drive that began when Pruss recovered a Morristown fumble at midfield. \nA short time later, West Morris' Solomon Holzworth scooped up another Morristown fumble and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown, making it 27-0. \nMorristown drove downfield midway in the third quarter but fumbled the ball away inside the 5 and Grauso recovered, setting up West Morris' 95-yard drive that ended when Jake Congdon scored a 2-yard touchdown run. \nThe key plays during the drive were a 45-yard run by Draghi and Sloan's 30-yard pass to Willie Ruppel, who made a leaping grab over a Morristown defender. \n\"It was a solid effort,\" said Hennelly, whose team was coming off a 21-0 loss to Roxbury. \"We had a good, hard week of practice.\" \nWest Morris 13 14 7 0 -- 34 \nMorristown 0 0 0 7 -- 7 \nW--Cole Draghi 2 run (Pat Egan kick). \nW--Ryan Pruss 1 pass from Cooper Sloan (kick failed). \nW--Bryce Sokolowski 3 run (Egan kick). \nW--Solomon Holzworth 22 fumble return. \nW--Jake Congdon 2 run (Egan kick). \nM--Patrick Meringolo 2 run (Ethan Bolson kick). \nTeam records -- West Morris 4-2, Morristown 3-3. 49 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dailyre.co/1ROIUik TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:15:34.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
