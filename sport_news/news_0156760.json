By Seattle Times staff The Associated Press \nLOS ANGELES – Jacob deGrom struck out 13 over seven scoreless innings in his postseason debut and Daniel Murphy homered off a star-crossed Clayton Kershaw to help the New York Mets defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-1 on Friday night for a 1-0 lead in their best-of-five NL Division Series. \nDeGrom (1-0) limited the Dodgers to five hits and walked one. The right-hander’s strikeouts tied the franchise playoff record set by Tom Seaver in Game 1 of the 1973 NL Championship Series. \nKershaw (0-1) endured his fifth straight postseason loss after giving up the seventh playoff homer of his career. Last season’s National League most valuable player and Cy Young Award winner allowed three runs and four hits in 62/3 innings, struck out 11 and walked four. \nRuns might again be at a premium when the Dodgers try to even the series Saturday night in Game 2.
