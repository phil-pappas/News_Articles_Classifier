Officers did not initially find a victim, but another 911 caller guided officers to a man suffering traumatic injuries.\nThe man, who has not been identified other than being described as a known gang member, has been taken to a Portland hospital with injuries that left him in critical condition, Portland Police Bureau spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said in a news release. Medical personnel believe that he may survive from his injuries, Simpson said, but homicide detectives are on site in the case that changes.\n\"What we know at this point is very little,\" Simpson said. \"We have a shooting victim; we have numerous reports of gunfire ... and we have no witness information at this point.\"\nAll access to the apartment complex is restricted as Gang Enforcement Team detectives and forensic experts conduct their investigation.\nNo suspect information is available.\nâ€” Nuran Alteir\nnalteir@oregonian.com\n503-294-4028\n@whatnuransaid", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/whatnuransaid"], "published": "2015-10-14T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:27:45.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
