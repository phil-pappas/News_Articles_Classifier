New York trailed 2-1 in the decisive Game 5 of the NL Division Series when with three infielders on the right side and no one near third, Murphy strolled to second on Lucas Duda's walk and sprinted to third. Travis d'Arnaud followed with a sacrifice fly, and Murphy homered in the sixth. Jacob deGrom allowed runners in all six of his innings but just two runs. Noah Syndergaard pitched the seventh, and Jeurys Familia got the first six-out save of his career. Despite a record $289-million payroll, the Dodgers remained without a World Series title since 1988.
