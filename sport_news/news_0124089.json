Here's a look at the biggest movers and shakers in his poll this week. \nTeam on the rise \n* Memphis: After beating the SEC’s Ole Miss, the Tigers jumped from No. 25 to No. 13 on my ballot. Memphis is 6-0 and while the strength of schedule leaves something to be desired, the Tigers have an NFL-caliber quarterback and just beat a team that won in Tuscaloosa, so they’ve earned a nice jump. \nTeam on the fall \n* UCLA: The Bruins took their second straight loss, a 21-point defeat to Stanford, which is playing as well as any team. UCLA has lost eight straight to Stanford, most of them lopsided. The Cardinal is the Bruins’ Kryptonite. UCLA dropped from No. 16 to 24 and would have been unranked if not for a soft final five. \nThe quiet undefeateds \n* Two Power 5 undefeated teams continue to ride under the radar, one being the Big 10’s Iowa and the other the ACC’s Florida State. Iowa’s remaining schedule is exceptionally easy. Florida State still has two big games ahead in Clemson and Florida. Keep an eye out for these two teams the rest of the way. \nBoise’s NY6 bowl bid dashed? \n* Boise State was crushed by Utah State, 52-26, thanks to eight turnovers and most likely kissed its chances for a New Year’s Six Bowl goodbye. The Broncos got into a New Year’s Six last year with two losses, but the AAC, with three undefeated teams, is the strong bet to get the Group of 5’s New Year’s Bowl spot. \nChris Murray’s AP Top 25 \n1. Ohio State (previously 1) \n2. Utah (2)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:46:34.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
