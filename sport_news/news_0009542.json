The Tigers were determined not to share — and it showed — as they rolled past Winchester 25-10, 25-16, 25-9. \nThat gave Hagerstown a perfect 7-0 mark in the TEC, a potential accomplishment that kept the Tigers focused after knocking off perennial contenders Union County and Centerville a week ago. \n\"We didn't want to lose it,\" Hagerstown junior Aimee Hoodlebrink said of sole possession of the TEC's top spot. \"We played very well tonight.\" \nThe Tigers can say that just about any night in their 27-5 season. Hagerstown repeated as Wayne County Tournament champion earlier this month before winning the program's first conference crown since 1991. \n\"It's a really great feeling. We weren't even alive the last one,\" said senior Morgan Masters. \n\"We were pretty focused. We needed to make sure that we did everything right.\" \nThis was the Tigers' third overall TEC title in volleyball. They shared the championship with Winchester and Northeastern in 1979, then won it outright in 1991. \nSince then, more often than not the road to the TEC has traveled through Union County. The Patriots have won 19 conference championships, all of which came from 1992 on. \nHagerstown halted Union County in four sets last week to snap the Patriots' 26-match conference winning streak, then defeated Centerville in five two days later to assure the Tigers no worse than a share. \n\"It's been a long time coming,\" said Hagerstown coach Brian Dale. \"We did not want to share it with anybody. \n\"Anytime you go on the road in the TEC, you're going to get a good match. I was really glad with the intensity we brought in. I was able to play everybody and finish it how we wanted to finish it.\" \nThe start was strong, too. \nThe Tigers surged ahead 9-3 in Game 1 before a Winchester timeout. Hagerstown didn't let up after the break, building the lead to 17-4. \nThe Falcons matched the Tigers early in Game 2 until a Hoodlebrink kill and three consecutive service points created some separation. \nBeth Jenkins closed that game out on the service line, with a tip by Hannah Rogers giving Hagerstown its final point. \nGame 3 was more of the same. The Tigers led 9-1 to start, with Masters serving seven straight points late in the game. \n\"We played very well tonight. We played very sound ,\" Dale said. \"We didn't make many mistakes, and we played good Hagerstown volleyball. Hopefully, we'll carry this into next week.\" \nThe Tigers took Union County to five sets in the regular season last year and advanced to the sectional final. \nExpectations were high entering 2015. \n\"We only lost two hitters and we got some new middle hitters,\" Masters said. \"We had players to fill in for our seniors from last year.\" \nJenkins had six kills for the Tigers on Thursday, with Brytni Dale contributing five kills and 12 digs, Hoodlebrink five kills and Rogers 10 digs and 20 assists. \nEmily White had 17 digs for the Falcons while Mykah Keener added 13. \nHagerstown's next match will also be at Winchester as Class 2A Sectional 41 opens play there on Thursday. \nThe Tigers will face Lincoln at 7:30 p.m., following the Union County-Winchester match at 6. \n\"We'll be right here again,\" Brian Dale said. \"I hope we'll bring the same intensity — I know that we will — and be ready to play Cambridge and hopefully move on.\" \nJosh Chapin: (765) 973-4463 jchapin@pal-item.com or twitter.com/JoshChapinPI 21 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1RLjO3I TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:40:06.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
