Comments \nThe Massachusetts football game had their first 2015 home game back up in Amherst on Saturday, and the UMass Marching Band was there to make sure fans at the tailgate were pumped and ready. \nLeading into kickoff the band broke up into smaller groups and weaved through the tailgate outside McGuirk Alumni Stadium, stopping and playing for fans throughout the parking lot. Most fans got a nice faceful of the UMass fight song right at their tailgate spots. However, some lucky fans got a serenade of \"Hey Baby,\" including the Dusel family, and their daughter Charlotte (seen in the video above in the purple hat). \nThe band also made a stop at the port-o-potties at the fair end of the parking lot, playing another round of \"Hey Baby\" to confused fans inside. \nCheck out the video above for these performances and one more from a big group setup outside the student entrance to the stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:53:51.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
