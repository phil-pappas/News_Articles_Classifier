The win over a Wildcats team that was receiving votes nationally elevates BU into a first-place tie in the America East standings. After the teams played 54 minutes of scoreless soccer, they combined for all three goals in a 15-minute span early in the second half. Roberts snapped a 1-1 tie by deflecting home an initial shot off the foot of freshman midfielder Harrison Weilbacher. It was Roberts' second goal in the last three games. \"The guys played great tonight ... we were very pleased with their performance,\" head coach Paul Marco said. \"To come here on the road and get that result ... it was terrific. Everyone played their part. Robert (Moewes) made an outstanding save in the first half and I thought our back four of Tucker (Sandercock), Zach (Galluzzo), Mike (Kubik) and Adam (Blackwell) was very good.\" Weilbacher set up BU's first goal of the game when his cross in the 55th minute found the head of Galluzzo. The junior back buried it for his third goal of the season. But UNH evened it five minutes later on a one-time volley off a long ball from midfield, setting the stage for Roberts' deciding tally. New Hampshire held a 12-7 edge in shots but BU's back line limited the looks and Moewes had to make just three saves. Binghamton returns to action Saturday night at Hartford. NOTES The seven wins are the most since the 2009 squad won nine ... the Bearcats improved to 9-6-2 all-time against UNH ... the win snapped a five-game BU losing streak in Durham and was BU's first road win in the series since 2003 (2-0 win) ... UNH was \"receiving votes\" in this week's NSCAA National Poll and was positioned third in the East Region.
