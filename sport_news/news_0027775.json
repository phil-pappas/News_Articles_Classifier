It takes time, and Wood-Ridge is the perfect example. When head coach Charlie Trentacosti took over three years ago, the Blue Devils were in the middle of a string of losing seasons. \nThe Blue Devils have made strides, and after a 44-14 victory over Wallington on Saturday, they stand a game away from reaching .500. \nIt is so much more than a step toward average, though. Take, for example, senior Joshua Paez, who is in his fourth season. \n“This is the first time that we’ve won a game before Week 5 since I’ve been here,” he said after a dominant performance against the Panthers. \n“We’ve had to learn how to take a loss and build off of it instead of just accepting the loss, and now we’re figuring out how to win.” \nThe Blue Devils (2-3) are doing it with just six seniors on the roster, which means the upperclassmen are not only looking at their own success in their final season but aiding the continuation of the rebuilding process. \n“We’re looking to leave our mark on the program as well as set a standard for the younger guys,” Paez said. “We’re working as hard as we can to be an example, and we’re getting the chance to enjoy winning as well.” \nPaez had a solid two-way game, running 24 times for 164 yards and two touchdowns and making eight tackles on defense. He also passed for four two-point conversions on option plays. \n“He’s been amazing the past three weeks,” Trentacosti said. “He’s been all over the field on both sides and absolutely led by example.” \nWallington (1-4) scored 1:48 into the game when Tyshaun Horton broke two tackles on the way to a 75-yard touchdown run. It was the kind of score that would have deflated previous Blue Devil teams, but not this one. \n“We just had to answer,” sophomore quarterback Mike Giancaspro said. “It was early and we knew we just had to go out and play our game.” \nGiancaspro pounced on a fumble forced by freshman Jake Colon at the Panther 15, and then found junior Chris Musante for a 7-yard score on fourth-and-2. \nPaez got the ball to junior Vincent Giordano for a two-point conversion that had Wood-Ridge up, 8-6, and it stayed that way until 1:13 remained in the first half, when Giancaspro rolled right and hit Colon for a 20-yard touchdown. \n“He might only be a sophomore, but he plays like a senior,” Trentacosti said. “I’m glad we’ve got him for two more years after this.” \nWallington missed a 40-yard field goal attempt in the waning seconds of the first half, and the Panthers trailed even though Horton, a senior, had run for 192 yards on 17 carries. \nThe second half was all Wood Ridge. \nPaez had touchdown runs of 9 and 71 yards in the third quarter to make it, 30-6, and senior Tony Parisi had a 10-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter. \nSophomore Elijah Mitchell had the other touchdown for Wallington, a team that also has only six seniors on its roster. \nWood-Ridge senior Dennis Luzba took a kickoff 95 yards for a TD to end the scoring. \n“The last two years, we had players,” Trentacosti said. “This year, we have a team. You can see the development that’s taking place, and the way this group has bonded.” \n“You walk down the hall in school and now everyone is saying ‘great game’ instead of sorry,” Giancaspro said, and Paez added, “people are like, ‘when is the next game.’ It’s great to be a part of this.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:20:02.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
