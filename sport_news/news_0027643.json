The Spartans were No. 2 and have slid to No. 7. \n“I’m not worried about it,” he said. “At the end of the year, all that matters is how many you have in the win column. \n“Sometimes, you don’t win pretty. As long as you’re winning football games, (that’s all that matters). \n“Coach (Mark) D’Antonio will be the first to tell you: ‘You have to overcome all that and win a football game.’” \nStanton hopes to see the Spartans go to 7-0 this week with a win over arch rival and No. 12-ranked Michigan in Ann Arbor. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. \n“Obviously, it’s a pressure weekend,” he said. “I can’t talk much, because we never beat (the Wolverines). \n“I have to keep my mouth shut during the week and ride the coattails of other people if we win. \n“Everybody always throws it back in my face. ‘You never beat them.’ So, touche!” \nThe rivalry and the fact Michigan is on a roll, too, is good for the state of the game in the state, Stanton added. \n“It’s better overall for the state when we have this top-25 matchup and people are looking forward to it,” he said. “Hopefully, it’s a perfect fall Saturday, and you can go in and support your team. \n“Obviously, (U-M coach) Jim Harbaugh is doing a tremendous job and it speaks for itself. He’s done that everywhere he’s gone. He’s got those kids believing, and that’s half the battle.” \nStanton was at Harrison to support the Taylor Haugen Foundation and its YESS (Youth Equipment for Sports Safety) program. \nThe foundation donated EvoShield body protection equipment to the Harrison football program. Stanton wears the same pads as an NFL quarterback for the Arizona Cardinals.
