(Photo: LSJ file) No. 7 MSU at No. 12 Michigan When: 3:30 p.m. Saturday, Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor TV/Radio: ESPN / WJIM 1240-AM and WMMQ 94.9-FM Line: Michigan by 8 \nEAST LANSING — Twenty years later, the essence of Nov. 4, 1995, still lives in those who danced that evening at Spartan Stadium. \nThe snow flurries. The crisp air. Day turning to night. The intense focus during the final drive. The euphoria. The hug from Nick Saban. \"That was the only and last time that I think he hugged anyone,\" said Nigea Carter, who caught the winning touchdown. The scoreboard: Spartans 28, Wolverines 25. Back when that didn't happen too often. \"I remember vividly after the game Michigan not shaking our hands, (their) players being in shock,\" former Michigan State quarterback Tony Banks said. \"And that, even though it was my last time playing them, really solidified the fact that I didn't like those guys. They weren't like us.\" Before Mark Dantonio took over this rivalry, MSU's wins against Michigan in the modern era came infrequently and usually with dramatic flair and a smudge of controversy. That probably never collided with hope for a new day more than in 1995. Saban's first season as coach. A flawed but talented collection of George Perles holdovers. A 4-3-1 record. And, late in the fourth quarter, 88 yards to go to beat No. 7 Michigan. \"When we'd go out on the field and know it was do-or-die, you'd kind of see some guys with nerves, but (on that drive) I just remember the razor-sharp focus in everybody's eyes, just how much they wanted it,\" Carter said. \"Just how clear Tony was on every play call. Just how silent the linemen were. The linemen they get antsy, especially moments like that. But they were silent. We listened to Tony and made sure no one jumped offsides.\" Banks at quarterback. Muhsin Muhammad, Derrick Mason and Carter at receiver. Marc Renaud at tailback. Scott Greene in front of him. The cast is familiar all these years later in part because of what happened next. An 11-play drive, defined by three plays. \nFirst, facing fourth-and-11 from the MSU 33-yard line, Banks found Mason for a tiptoe catch against the Michigan sideline. To this day, Mason appears to be short of the first down. \"Thank goodness for the spot,\" Banks said. \"He did a good job with his feet, but it was a fortunate spot.\" MSU's top 50 football players: No. 48 Derrick Mason \n\"When I look at the TV copy of the game, you couldn't tell this from the field, I still don't believe D-Mas got the first down,\" said linebacker Ike Reese, the Spartans' leading tackler that day. \"But somehow the marker there had to be off (it's spot), because he still comes up short of that orange marker. But the chain length was the exact length (of the spot).\" Four plays later, Banks connected with Mason again in hold-your-breath fashion — a 22-yard pass zipped toward the left side, tipped and nearly intercepted by freshman defensive back Charles Woodson. Mason corralled the ball while falling on his back at the 25-yard line. \"That's the most memorable play on the drive,\" Reese said. \"It was just fantastic concentration by Derrick Mason.\" \nMichigan State celebrates the game-winning touchdown catch by Nigea Carter (81) in its 1995 win over Michigan at Spartan Stadium.

But it was just a back-shoulder catch. Once I caught it, I knew I was in and I knew that was it. Everybody just rushed the field. Nothing really can compare to that.\" Except that wasn't it. MSU had left 1 minute, 24 seconds on the clock for Reese and Co. to stop Michigan one last time. \"I can still remember the message in the huddle: To the young guys that were our safeties, 'Get back. Get deep. Don't let the ball get thrown over your head. Guys up front, pin your ears back. Reggie (Garnett) and I, we'll take care of a screen play, anything short.'\" That game remains the legacy of Banks and Carter at MSU. Both are grateful for it. \n\"Without that game, other than my NFL career, I don't know if I'm ever remembered in East Lansing,\" said Banks, who completed 26 of 34 passes for 318 yards and two touchdowns that day. \nCarter, who settled in Michigan, still gets recognized as the guy who caught the pass to beat Michigan 20 years ago. \"Every now and then I'll be talking to someone or I'll present my credit card at the store and someone will say, 'Are you the receiver?'\" Carter said. \"I know it's an unusual name and pretty easy to recognize, especially if you're a fan.\" For Reese, who resides in Philadelphia where he hosts a radio show, the 1995 win over Michigan brought not only lasting joy, but confidence. As with Banks, it may have propelled his NFL career. \nScott Greene rushed for two touchdowns and caught seven passes in MSU's 1995 win over Michigan at Spartan Stadium. (Photo: MSU Athletic Communications) \nBut Reese hoped it would be more for MSU. He thought it might be the beginning of what's happening now. Instead, it was a false start. \"That's what that vibe really was, in Nick's first year, it should have been the spring board toward letting us know we had the ability to do those things. It sort of gives you confirmation that you can play on the same stage with those guys, and you can believe in what the coach was trying to instill in us in his first year. It really did, it made us believe in coach (Saban). Unfortunately, it did not carry over because we still had other issues in the infrastructure of the team that it took a while for us to learn how to win and do it on a consistent basis.\" \nSaban later told former Lansing State Journal columnist Jack Ebling that he wished he hadn't won that game, that it created a false sense of where the program was. \nThe coach who would eventually take program where Saban couldn't was there that evening in his first season as MSU's defensive backs coach. \n\"I've always been really good friends with defensive backs,\" Banks said. \"I talk trash to them in practice. I talked trash to Dantonio. He was very stern-faced. Some days he didn't like me very much. But I've got a lot of love for the guy.\" \nBoth that year began to understand the MSU-Michigan rivalry. \n\"I remember Muhsin diving over the top of the group celebrating in the end zone,\" said Banks, who lives in Dallas but still follows MSU football religiously. \"Me and Muhsin reminisce on occasion. We're like that Troy Aikman commercial. We say we don't live in the past, but every chance we get, we talk about it.\" \nGraham Couch can be reached at gcouch@lsj.com.
