And we we play like that on offense, it's pretty hard to stop.\" \nCertainly the Lions (3-3, 2-1) had a tough time -- especially against quarterback Coey Watson. The sophomore completed 22 of 33 passes, with three touchdowns and 1 interception, for 271 yards, while also rushing for 136 yards and three scores. It was a stellar performance -- one that helped deny a stunning second half fightback from Franklin after the visitors fell behind 28-0 but closed within one possession on three separate occasions. \nEach time the Lions charged, Watson was there to answer, however -- tossing a 15-yard touchdown pass and then leaping into the end zone from one-yard for two crucial fourth quarter touchdowns. \n\"He's always a winner; he's humble and he's always ready to go,\" Maxwell said of Watson, who completed passes to four different receivers. \n\"It was all up to our offensive line; they blocked great for me tonight, and then everybody was also keying on (Dawson County running back) Hunter (Mitchell) because he's been running so well, and that opened some lanes up for me,\" Watson said. \"Right now I feel like the offense can move the ball and score on any defense.\" \nMitchell finished with 107 yards rushing, while receivers Austin Young (12 receptions, 114 yards, 1 TD) and Tucker Maxwell (7 receptions, 131 yards, 2 TDs) proved Watson's top targets. \nFranklin County's offense also had moments of astounding potency, as running backs Conner Williams, Eshun Hall and Bud Woods took turns gashing the Tigers on the perimeter. \n\"That's what happens when you play an option football team; they did a good job getting outside, and sometimes it makes you look silly,\" Maxwell said. \"But we finally adjusted on that last series.\" \nThe Tigers forced a turnover on downs with 1:44 remaining -- the lone possession of the second half in which the Lions did not score. \nIt was a far cry from the start of the contest. \nDawson County actually punted on third down on their opening possession -- it was about the only lowlight of the entire first half for the Tigers’ offense however. \nTaking over at its own 23 -- after forcing a turnover on downs -- Dawson County pieced together a 12-play drive culminating in a three-yard touchdown run from Watson. Hunter Mitchell then scampered in for a two-point conversion and an 8-0 lead with 4:42 left in the quarter. \nDawson County was only warming up, however, and the Tigers scorched the visitors in the second quarter, as Watson threw two touchdown passes and ran for another to help Dawson take a 28-0 lead. \nWatson completed seven straight passes at one point during the quarter -- part of a stellar night through the air for sophomore, who put up 202 yards passing in the first half alone. His 32-yard scoring strike to Tucker Maxwell -- a pump-and-go route worked to perfection -- made it 14-0 early in the second quarter. The signal caller added a five-yar scoring scamper for a 22-0 lead and then hooked up with Austin Young on a five-yard touchdown pass for a 28-0 advantage with 4:27 remaining in the half. \nWhile the body blows rocked Franklin County, the Lions recovered to land two big blows of their own, however, scoring twice before the interval. \nEshun Hall ran through tackles before finding a crease to make it 28-6 on a 32-yard touchdown run (the point after kick failed). The Lions continued their fightback on the last play of the half -- quarterbackTyrique David lofting a 32-yard Hail Mary that eluded two Dawson County defenders and dropped into the hands of Brooklon Wright to make it 28-12 (a two-point run attempt failed). \nFranklin continued its surge after the interval, moving within 31-26 just before the fourth quarter on the strength of a long touchdown run from Williams and a heads-up defensive play from Jacob Brown, who jumped a Watson pass and returned the interception 40 yards. \nInstead of panicking, the Tigers simply put the ball back in the hands of Watson, who conducted three fourth quarter touchdown drives, capping two of them with a scoring pass and a scoring run of his own. \n\"We came into this game nervous, but we fought through that,\" said Watson, who will lead Dawson County on the road to Fannin County next week. \"That's huge for us. We don't want to slip up; we want to keep our momentum going next week.\" \nSCORING SUMMARY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:25:46.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
