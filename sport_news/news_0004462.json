Morry Gash / AP FOX Sports Wisconsin Dave Heller Share This Story Updated Sep 30, 2015 at 3:40p ET \nTwo more freshmen for Wisconsin played this past week against Hawaii, running the season total to 18. However, of those, only four are \"true\" freshmen, the rest redshirts. \nAgainst Hawaii, Alec Ingold became the latest to have his redshirt burned (figuratively, of course, but a ceremony like that might be interesting). Having just moved to running back from linebacker, Ingold made an immediate impressio, getting seven carries against the Rainbow Warriors. Of course, the freshman who had the biggest impact against Hawaii was another running back, Taiwan Deal , who scored twice and rushed for 147 yards. \nThe other freshman that played, by the way, was spring game start Evan Bondoc , a safety. That leaves only four redshirt freshmen who have yet to see the field this year: offensive lineman Beau Benzschawel , who could be back shortly, third-string quarterback D.J. Gillins , nose tackle Jeremy Patterson , despite being listed as No. 2 on the depth chart, and wide receiver Peter Roy , a walk-on from Muskego. \nFinally, if you are comparing to last year, Wisconsin used 20 freshmen in 2014. Of those, 11 were redshirts (compared to 14 of 18 this season). \nHere's the complete list of playing time and season totals for the young Badgers: \n\"TRUE\" FRESHMEN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:28:32.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
