This is despite having constructed a three-storeyed house and having three daughters-in-law and two daughters. To add to their misery in this ripe age, the shanty lies opposite to their house, but none of the daughters-in-law and daughters has even bothered to enquire about their condition, forget about helping them at the fag end of their lives. Their three sons have passed away. The couple is largely dependent on the mercy of the villagers and few octogenarians who are paying the electricity and water supply bill of the room they are putting up in. As Gurdev is unable to walk much due to an accident, Tej Kaur is compelled to work in a nearby private factory for Rs 100 a day to arrange two meals a day for the duo. Gurdev Singh, after slight hesitation, said that he belonged to Mardanpur village near Shambu. His 40 bigha land was fraudulently taken away by his brother, who was a kanungo, almost 45 years back. He then shifted to Patiala with his wife, three sons and two daughters and started from scratch. Gradually, they constructed their own house in the city’s Bishan Nagar area and married off their daughters. One of their sons went on to join the Army. The couple later purchased more plots in Chaura village near Patiala and shifted there, leaving the earlier house to the eldest son as he had started troubling them all. “When my son, who was serving in the Army retired, we purchased 6 acres in Bhucho Mandi village near Bathinda. “But my daughter said she wanted to send her son to Canada and wanted our help to show money in his account. My son sold the land and gave her the money that she promised to return but never did. “As a result, my son went into depression and died. His wife immediately threw us out of the house,” said Gurdev. Gasping for breath, Tej Kaur, who had returned from the factory just to ensure that Gurdev had eaten his food, said that due to the infighting among brothers, we divided our property among our sons so that they would not fight after we are gone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:10:48.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
