The Wolves moved to 6-0 with the win and 4-0 in the district. \nBY ANDY KRUTSINGER \nMt. Pleasant News \nNEW LONDON — Winfield-Mt. Union and New London had a Henry County showdown on the football field Friday night. The Wolves picked up a road win over the Tigers, 46-14 and extended their undefeated season to 6-0. \nThe Wolves continued to roll on defense and forced three turnovers in the win. The first of which was one of the biggest plays of the game. On just the second play from scrimmage, New London fumbled the ball inside the five. The ball rolled to the one-yard line and Matthew Niebuhr scooped it up and fell in the end zone for a defensive score that made it 8-0 after a two-point conversion by Darren Hunter. \nLater in the first quarter, Hunter made it a two-score game with a 39-yard touchdown run. Bryce Robison ran the ball in for the two-point conversion and W-MU led 16-0 after one quarter of play. \nThe Wolves started to break it open in the third quarter. W-MU quarterback Kolt Rossiter found Garret Baker for a 20-yard touchdown pass early in the quarter and a two-point catch by Hunter made it 24-0. \nThe New London offense started to pick it up in the second. Blake Nehring attempted a season-high 34 passes and found success by spreading the ball to six different receivers throughout the game. \nThe Tigers drove the length of the field with their passing game midway through the second quarter. Austin McBeth, Jayden Flowers and Tyler Stevenson were catching passes and the Tigers made it into the red zone with a chance to cut the lead. \nStevenson caught a ball inside the five and looked to score the Tigers’ first touchdown, but the official said he stepped out of bounds. A few plays later, New London coughed up the ball at the one-yard line and Baker recovered the ball for W-MU. \nOn the first play of the W-MU drive, Rossiter found Baker with a bomb pass from the one-yard line and Baker hauled in the catch behind the defense. He outran the Tiger secondary, and scored for a 99-yard touchdown catch. After a two-point conversion, the Wolves led 32-0, and that’s where it would stay until halftime. \nThe Tigers continued to move the ball well through the air to start the third quarter but the W-MU defense stopped New London in the red zone with a sack on fourth down. The Wolves’ offense made the Tigers pay again, this time with a 34-yard touchdown reception by Baker to bring the score to 38-0. \nWith the lead surpassing 35-points, the clock was running continuously, but McBeth and the Tiger offense put a stop to that early in the fourth quarter. After the defense stopped the Wolves in the red-zone, the Tigers gave McBeth the ball, and the senior was able to work his magic. \nMcBeth started the drive off by running from the New London nine-yard line to the W-MU 26 for a 65-yard run. The Tigers moved the ball inside the five, and McBeth capped off the drive with a four-yard touchdown run that cut the lead to 38-6. \nZach Davis bumped the score back up later in the fourth. Davis caught a 51-yard pass from Rossiter and brought it to the end zone for his first touchdown reception of the game. The two-point conversion made it 46-6 for the Wolves’ biggest lead of the game. \nNew London scored once more late in the fourth quarter. Nehring ran the ball up the middle on fourth down for a five-yard touchdown run. Keontae Luckett scored on a two-point conversion to cut the score to 46-14 where it would stay. \nRossiter finished the day 13-26 for 279 yards and four touchdowns through the air. Baker was his favorite receiver on the day, and the senior wide out finished with 194 yards and three scores. Davis’ one catch for a 51-yard score made him the Wolves’ second leading receiver. \nSam Jennings led the Wolves in tackles, with nine. Baker finished with 7.5 tackles and a fumble recovery. Warren Krieger-Coble and Robison each had six tackles and Niebuhr had 5.5 with a fumble recovery and a defensive touchdown. Davis had one interception in the game and brought it back for 18 yards. \nNehring went 20-34 passing for New London. He had 242 yards through the air and an interception. He also ran the ball for 16 yards and one score. McBeth had 127 yards receiving, 81 yards rushing and one touchdown on the ground. \nOther big performers for the New London offense were Tyler Stevenson, with 53 yards receiving, and Jayden Flowers, with 38 yards receiving. The defense was led by McBeth, with seven tackles, Cole Helmerson, with six, and Colton Francis, with five. \nWith the win, the Wolves moved to 6-0 overall and 4-0 in the district. They’ll be at WACO (3-3, 3-1) this week. New London falls to 2-4 overall and 1-3 in the district. They will host Van Buren (0-6, 0-4) this week for homecoming. \nW-MU is starting to look like a lock for a playoff spot. The Wolves need just one more win to clinch a spot. New London will likely need to win out to grab the fourth spot. \nClass A D6 standings (overall record in parenthesis) \nT-1. W-MU 4-0 (6-0) \nT-3. Lone Tree 3-1 (4-2) \nT-3. WACO 3-1 (3-3) \nT-5.
