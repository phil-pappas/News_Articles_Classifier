HACKENSACK – Jordan Hunter isn’t pretending this is any ordinary football game.\nNeither are his Hackensack teammates.\nPassaic Tech, the Comets’ opponent tonight at home, is 7-0 against them since the teams began playing regularly in 2009. Worst still, Hunter, a senior receiver/cornerback, and five other three-year Hackensack starters have been beaten badly by the Bulldogs three times since 2013.\nHackensack’s average margin of defeat in those three games is 30 points, including a 40-6 loss in the first round of the North 1, Group 5 playoffs in 2013.\n“We feel like we have to beat them,” said Hunter, who has made 18 tackles and intercepted two passes this season. “We beat them, we have a chance to go to MetLife [Stadium]. Mentally, if we beat them, it’ll give us more of a swagger. We’ll play with a different vibe if we beat them.”\nBy MetLife, Hunter referred to the North 1, Group 5 championship game.\nThe Comets believe they’re good enough to get there this season, former Paterson Catholic coach Benjie Wimberly’s fourth at Hackensack.\nThey know, though, that they must end their losing streak to Passaic Tech – probably Hackensack’s most formidable competitor in its section – to prove it.\nHackensack (2-1), ranked No. 4 in The Record Public Top 20, demonstrated its legitimacy as a championship contender during a 34-29 home loss Sept. 5 to second-ranked Pascack Valley (3-0) in its opener. Pascack Valley has won the past two North 1, Group 4 championships and played in three straight sectional finals.\nStill, the Comets acknowledge a close loss tonight to fifth-ranked Passaic Tech (3-0) won’t suffice.\n“The Pascack Valley game was the game where we showed we’re legit,” Wimberly said, “that we’re not just happy to be in the playoffs, we’re not just happy to win one round. This is our second shot in five weeks.\n“This is our chance. We don’t want to hear any excuses. We don’t want to hear about officials or weather or any other stuff. We just have to get out here and get to work.”\nThe Comets have improved steadily under Wimberly, a Passaic Tech graduate whose Paterson Catholic teams won seven sectional titles in 15 seasons.\nHackensack went 5-5 and 6-4, respectively, and reached the playoffs in his first two seasons. The Comets finished 9-2 last season and lost at eventual champion Montclair in the North 1, Group 5 semifinals.\nTheir other loss last season was a 35-7 defeat at Passaic Tech, which lost to Montclair in the sectional championship game at MetLife Stadium.\n“We have to get this win,” said senior guard/defensive tackle Dylan Theiss, another three-year starter for Hackensack.\n“We’ve been losing to them the past couple of years. We’ve got to pick it up. … It’s about the push up front. On offense and defense, we have to win the line of scrimmage. We have to play harder than them.”\nPassaic Tech has gotten off to a strong start, despite the graduation departures of quarterback Zaire Weaver, leading rusher Elijah Dolson, standout defensive linemen Kenny Alston and Todd Drysdale and middle linebacker Drew Lindsay – The Record’s 2014 Defensive Player of the Year.\nThe Bulldogs easily have defeated Eastside (35-0), Passaic (39-3) and Kennedy (29-8), but those teams are a combined 2-7-1.\nSenior tailback Kevin Copper has rushed for 329 yards and four touchdowns on 35 carries to help Passaic Tech account for 34.3 points per game.\n“This game is huge because this is a team that went to the Group 5 championship game last year,” said Hackensack senior linebacker Jaysen Thompson, the Comets’ leading tackler (34 total, 12 for losses) and a three-year starter.\n“This is a team we could see in the playoffs, so we need to get this win to get over the hump, to show everybody we’re a true contender.”\nEmail: idec@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:57:29.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
