It’s been here the whole time ... just now that we’re getting to the playoffs and on a national stage ... it’s a shock to a lot of people.\" \nKeuchel, who shut down the Yankees in the AL wild-card game, worked out of jam after jam, allowing five hits and one run with seven strikeouts after going 15-0 at home this season — a modern major-league record. He has a 1.45 ERA at Minute Maid Park in 19 starts this year. \n\"The ball in Dallas Keuchel’s hand brings an awful lot of confidence to a lot of people. Including me,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \"And he came up with some excellent pitches.\" \nLuke Gregerson gave up a leadoff homer in the ninth to Alex Gordon before finishing off the Astros first playoff game in Houston in 10 years with a four-out save. It was his first save of more than three outs in three years. \nJason Castro drove in two runs with a single in the fifth that made it 2-1. Carlos Gomez, who has a rib muscle strain, started for the first time in the series and had an RBI single in the sixth. \nCarter’s soaring solo homer, which landed on the train tracks atop the wall in left-center and came on Danny Duffy’s first pitch of the seventh, pushed the lead to 4-1. \nCarter, who hit .199 in the regular season but is batting .455 in the postseason, was a triple shy of the cycle for the Astros. \n\"After struggling so much this year and just having the success I’ve been having in the last couple of weeks, it’s been nice to contribute and helps us win games,\" said Carter, whose team hosted a playoff game for the first time since the 2005 World Series. \nLorenzo Cain hit a solo homer in the fourth for the Royals, who are on the brink of elimination after reaching the World Series last season. \nKansas City starter Edinson Volquez fell to 0-3 in his postseason career by allowing five hits and three runs in 5 2/3 innings. \nHouston took the series lead in front of a rowdy, playoff-starved sellout crowd of 42,674. The group was mostly clad in orange and dotted with fans sporting fake beards in support of the star lefty, who has become all but untouchable at home. \nThey were given inflatable orange sticks at the door and spent the afternoon beating them as they cheered, making the roar in the closed-roof stadium deafening at times. \n\"Electric crowd, and it was 10 years coming,\" Keuchel said. \nKeuchel wasn’t as sharp as he was at Yankee Stadium, but he was able to tiptoe out of trouble again and again and got deep in the game despite a pitch count that got high early. He finished with a season-high 124 pitches. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:28:28.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
