Mattingly even suggested he “will be friends like forever” with his former bosses.\n“I don’t really want to get into details of our conversations. They were good conversations, they were open and they were honest,” Mattingly said by phone from his offseason home in Evansville, Ind. “It just became evident that this was the best thing for both parties.”\nAt Dodger Stadium, president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman and general manager Farhan Zaidi parroted the same vacuous message.\nMost Read Stories Fugitive felon, linked to motorcycle gang, captured in Lynnwood after 4-month hunt 5 ways CaliBurger is better than In-N-Out Files for lawsuit against CIA stolen in 'suspicious' break-in at UW Bill the Butcher workers still seeking CEO who vanished with their pay Seahawks’ Fred Jackson crashes car; Cops say no evidence of drag racing Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. “It was kind of organic,” Friedman said. “It just kind of crystallized that is something that potentially made a lot of sense.”\nBefore they came to that conclusion, the parties discussed extending Mattingly’s contract beyond next year, its final season.\nZaidi said a contract extension was discussed, but no official offer was made.\n“I’ve had my own level of cynicism hearing about people mutually parting ways,” he said. “We can sit up here with all level of sincerity and say that’s how it came about.”\nLos Angeles was 446-363 in five years under Mattingly, finishing with a winning record in every season and claiming the last three NL West titles. But the Dodgers have not reached the World Series since winning the championship in 1988.\nThe 54-year-old former Yankees star ranks sixth in wins among Dodgers managers and may not be out of a job long.\nMattingly’s name surfaced last month for the Miami Marlins’ opening. Owner Jeffrey Loria, a New York native, is said to be a big fan of Mattingly.\nThere also are managerial openings in San Diego, Seattle and Washington.\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Kansas City Royals have established a reputation for dramatic postseason comebacks the past couple of years, beginning with last season’s wild-card victory over Oakland.\nTurns out, the Toronto Blue Jays have some never-say-quit spirit as well.\nAfter going on a second-half run to make the playoffs, then rallying from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Texas in a best-of-five matchup, the Blue Jays will try to beat the Royals in another win-or-else situation in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series on Friday night.\nToronto forced the series back to Kansas City with a 7-1 rout on Wednesday, closing to 3-2.\n“You look at all the elimination games, our offense has really come to life,” Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. “We’ve said all along that’s the key to our team, scoring runs. You hate to make a habit of it, but maybe we can pull it off again.”\nDavid Price will take the mound for the Blue Jays after his collapse in Game 2, when he tossed six shutout innings and then surrendered five runs in the seventh.\nYordano Ventura will oppose him for Kansas City. He was only marginally better, allowing three runs and eight hits in 51/3  innings before watching the comeback win from the dugout.\n“I’m very fortunate and happy that this game has landed on my turn, here in Kansas City, and with the opportunity to take this club to the World Series,” Ventura said through catching coach Pedro Grifol, acting as a translator. “I’ll be ready for this game.”\nNotes • The Box Red Sox said manager John Farrell’s cancer is in remission. Farrell has non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\n• Oakland Athletics left-hander Drew Pomeranz has undergone surgery on his pitching shoulder.\n• The NL Championship Series had its largest television audience since 2010 despite lasting just four games. The New York Mets’ sweep of the Chicago Cubs in a matchup of big-market teams averaged 7.9 million viewers on TBS. The network said that was the most since the six-game Giants-Phillies series five years ago on Fox.\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:27:37.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
