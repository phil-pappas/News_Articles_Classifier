The project costs about $200,000 each day, and the company doing the work hasn't received a dime from a mitigation bank designed to take in money from companies that destroy wetlands and use that money for projects like this one, below Jesuit Bend on the west bank of Plaquemines Parish.\n\"Formally, we haven't received our mitigation banking credit, so we are at risk there,\" Howard said.\nThe dredge and the pipeline work 24-7, pumping new earth into Plaquemines Parish at the rate of 40,000 cubic yards a day. The pipes have been laid, there's plenty of land to rebuild, and project proponents hope to pump more sediment, as far as 15 miles away, into the depleted marshes of the northern Barataria system.\n\"We'd like to do a lot more of this work, we've learned a lot in this process,\" Howard said.\nAnd there's another bonus. This land will be preserved as wetlands forever, and will never be used commercially again. Last year, the land appeared as open water, after being devastated by farming and other activities.\n\"It's been disturbed by cattle and agriculture, and a variety of different insults to the ecology that we're setting right now,\" Howard said.\nJust like the meter is running on Louisiana's wetlands, so is the meter for a company that hasn't received a dime for this project.\n\"We're in the final phase of being approved, out of the 240 acres we're restoring we will get credit for that,\" Fell said.\nIf all goes well, this company believes it's setting up a road map to speed up coastal restoration projects in a state where the need is great.\nWhen all said and done, the Jesuit Bend project will have pumped 1.3 million cubic yards of river sand into the marsh. Restoration Systems now waits for approval from seven different agencies, in order to receive mitigation credits to cover their costs.\nCopyright 2015.
