The companies employees aren't allowed to bet on their own sites but until recently could play on competing sites. \nThe unregulated industry is facing questions from lawmakers, investigators and consumers. \nDraftKings says the investigation led by the former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts now with firm Greenberg Taurig confirms its earlier internal review. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
