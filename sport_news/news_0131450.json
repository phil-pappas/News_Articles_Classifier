They have ailments and questions in every phase of the game heading to No. 12 U-M (5-1, 2-0), which crushed Northwestern, 38-0.\nThe Spartans are dropping in the polls (from No. 4 to No. 7 in the AP, from No. 3 to No. 4 in the Amway Coaches Poll), for whatever that's worth. The Wolverines are favored, and the line immediately jumped to seven points, also for whatever that's worth.\nSome national media already are billing the game as a program referendum of sorts â€” USA TODAY's Dan Wolken wrote Sunday: \"If Michigan wins this game, effectively ending the Spartans' hopes of making the College Football Playoff, it may be years before Michigan State fans recover from the gut-punch.\"\nDantonio, whose program has won 32 of its past 35 games and is working on possibly his best recruiting class, will preview the U-M game Tuesday. Immediately after escaping Rutgers and before encountering the plane issues, he didn't want to delve into the matchup when asked.\n\"I'm gonna just delay that response right now and focus on the present, like I keep telling our football team,\" he said. \"Focus on the present, get on the plane, get back home. Collect ourselves, look at the things we did well, look at the things we've got to get better at, make decisions, and we'll worry about our football team.\"\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com.
