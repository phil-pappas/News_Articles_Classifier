We go out there and race each other.” \nLogano certainly wasn’t about to issue any apologies from wrecking Kenseth. \n“It’s a tough sport,” he said. “It’s like that in any professional sport. It’s not supposed to be easy. \n“It wouldn’t be that much fun if it was easy. We wouldn’t be doing this, so that’s why this is the top level of motorsports here in the Sprint Cup level. \n“It toughened me up pretty quick in the first two or three years of my career. You don’t really have an option sometimes but to toughen up.” \nAnd if you think that Logano is about to take his foot off of the gas pedal this week at Talladega Superspeedway with a free pass already in his pocket to the next Chase round, you would be wrong. \nHe said he will not be doing any defensive driving at the big, bad Alabama oval \n“That’s our job is to go out there and win,” Logano said. “I’m pretty sure you look at some of our legends in our sport, they didn’t go out there to run second. \n“They didn’t become Hall of Famers by saying, ‘Second is good this week. We won last week.’ \n“We’re able to go into that race and be relaxed and that’s something to feel good about because our goal coming into this weekend was to win the race and keep everyone not feeling too comfortable about Talladega.” \nHe goes forward in his quest for a first Sprint Cup championship knowing that his owner has his back regardless for what others may think of his driving. \nPenske said on Sunday all he does is give Logano the best car possible to start the race and the rest is up to him. \nAnd he doesn’t expect Logano’s recent tough driving style to change anytime soon. \n“He’s got to race the guys around him,” Penske said. “We don’t race the car. We prepare the car and bring it to the track. Each one of these drivers know what the circumstances are and with that they’re gonna make the moves that are necessary to try to get ahead. \n“To me, that’s gonna be the pattern as we go the next four or five races.” \nCANADIAN ‘STILL ALIVE’ IN CHASE \nCanada’s contribution to the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship took a hit at Kansas Speedway but is still alive. \nThe No. 78 Furniture Row Chevrolet team of Martin Truex Jr. with London, Ont., native Cole Pearn running the show on pit lane started the day in third place, but fell to the eighth and final Chase position after a 15th place result in the Hollywood Casino 400. \nIt was all because of stop and go penalty after an errant tire got away during a pit stop on Lap 213. \nPrior to the penalty Truex was running in the top-10 but after he made his pass-through penalty, he fell a lap down. \n“It was a tough day,” Truex said. “We fought hard on the car all day and got much better right when we got the penalty. We were fast at the end, but not enough time to get back up there.” \nThe good news is that Truex is still in the thick of the playoff battle going into next week’s wild-card race at Talladega Superspeedway when only eight of the 12 drivers now in the Chase advancing to the next round. \n“We’re still alive,” Pearn said. “Considering what happened today I guess it could have been worse. We’re still on the plus side heading to Talladega.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:56:56.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
