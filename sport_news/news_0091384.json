A A A \nComing off its first loss of the season, Trinity Classical Academy was looking to get back on track on Friday night when it hosted the California School for the Deaf of Riverside. \nKnights senior Ian Caddow returned the opening kickoff 65 yards for a touchdown and Trinity never slowed down in a 68-0 win at Canyon High. \nThe game was never in doubt as Trinity junior running back Caden Kulp contributed four first half rushing touchdowns. Sophomore quarterback Tyler Lee connected with Caddow on a 32-yard touchdown pass that pushed the Knight lead to 24-0 in the first quarter. And Trinity would go on to lead the Cubs 56-0 at halftime. \nCoaches from both schools agreed at the start of the third quarter that the remainder of the game would use a running clock. Trinity (3-1) added touchdowns from freshman Matthew Stratton and sophomore Oscar Hernandez in the second half. Hernandez’s touchdown run from 27 yards out set the final score at 68-0. Lee took a knee on the 2-point attempt, and the ensuing kickoff ran the clock out on the contest. \nThe final score may not tell the full story of the game, however. The game’s true highlight may have been the sportsmanship shown by the players on both sidelines. After each tackle, defensive players were helping up the offensive players before they went back to their respective huddles. Second-year Knights head coach Les Robinson called it “a lesson of humanity.” \nRobinson gathered both teams at midfield after the game to speak about the game and the lessons learned from it. Robinson was visibly moved after the talk. \n“I can’t wait to see what these kids do once they leave here and go into the world,” said Robinson. \nKulp, the Knights’ leading rusher, shared his coach’s sentiments. \n“It gives you a huge perspective on the world,” Kulp said. \nThe Knights next take the field Saturday versus Santa Clarita Christian at Canyon High School in what is being billed as the “Faith Bowl.” Kickoff for the game is 7 p.m. \n“We’re going to play SCCS hard, and it’s going to be a great game,” said Robinson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:45:12.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
