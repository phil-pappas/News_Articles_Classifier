A A A \nThe Valencia girls volleyball team is extremely balanced. \nAnd the Vikings showed how good that balance can be as they swept the Hart Indians in straight games Thursday night at Valencia High by scores of 25-18, 25-12, 25-16. \n“We really couldn’t ask for too much more,” said Valencia head coach Ray Sanchez. “We really wanted to come out and focus on fundamentals and be fundamentally sound.” \nThe Vikings were able to serve, pass, and they had a balanced attack on their way to a 5-0 Foothill League record. They also improved to 12-4 overall on the season. \nOutside hitters Lauren Russ and Kelsey Knudsen were all over the court for the Vikings, knocking in eight and seven kills, respectively. Russ also had 16 digs and an ace and three total blocks, while Knudsen had four aces and 11 digs, including a saving dig on a 3-ball in game 3 that gave the Vikings a 13-9 lead. \n“We really wanted this,” Russ said. “We wanted to show that we worked so hard for this. They’re a good team and we knew they would put up a fight. But we came in with some confidence.” \nLeading the balanced attack for the Vikings was Emily Burns, who had nine kills and two blocks on the night. \nBri Coleman, who was playing just her second league match for Valencia, had six kills and four total blocks. \nSetter Rachel Perez led the Vikings with 27 assists, while Demi Dawson tallied 12 digs. \nIt was a rough night for the Indians, who dropped to 4-1 in league and 8-4 overall. \nAlthough Hart came out with a lot of energy and led Valencia 12-9 with a kill and two straight blocks from Sarah Coblentz in the first game, the Vikings were able to storm back. \nCoblentz had four kills and five blocks on the night. Madi Fay also had four kills on the night, while Liz Baker had a team-high 17 digs. \nThe second game was filled with errors from the Indians, and they couldn’t sustain the attacking from their Foothill foes. \n“It’s harder to come back from a loss, especially when you’re feeling the pressure and coming into their gym, and you want to win league,” said Hart head coach Mary Keen. “It was kind of just falling bad on all levels.” \nHart and Valencia, which split last year’s Foothill League title, are still scheduled to face each other one more time at the end of the season on Nov. 3 at Hart High School. \n“If we were to have lost, our goal would’ve been to win every match in the second half of league. And if we won, we focus on the same scenario,” Sanchez said. “That last match at Hart is going to be a must-win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:35:02.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
