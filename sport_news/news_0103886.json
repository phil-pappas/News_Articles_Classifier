Subash Singh was the fifth change made by the hosts. \nThese alterations looked to have galvanized the home team as the frontline duo of Norde and Chhetri were fed repeatedly from the midfield and kept the rival defense busy through repeated forays. \nThe visiting team made one change in the starting eleven by including Sehnaj Singh in midfield for injured Zodingliana Ralte. Brazilian Anderson Chicao went back to central defense to partner Anas Edathodika. \nMumbai, who had scored their only goal so far during their 1-3 loss to FC Pune City on October 5 and then failed to score in their next two games, found the mark in the 13th minute after a delightful 1-2 between Norde and Chhetri. \nChhetri, who was later booked by the referee, applied the finishing touch with a deft low shot into the left corner of the net, after his strike partner had hoodwinked three defenders to lay the pass to him, much to the delight of the small crowd of spectators. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:22:27.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
