It's a significant leap given the ranking is devoid of the politics involved with the various organisations that splinter the sport. \nThe 23-year-old's third-round TKO of Meehan in Auckland on Thursday night is yet to be factored in with the various associations but could also see improvement to his rankings that have him No 6 with the WBO, 13 with the WBA and 14 with the WBC. \nMeehan's ranking plummeted 17 places to No 44 with BoxRec as they did the maths on just the sixth loss of the 45-year-old's long career. \nParker's rise was the biggest in their heavyweight division and, interestingly, sees him march past his contemporary rival, young Brit Anthony Joshua, who is at No 16. \nHe also overtook other big names including the American pair of Antonio Tarver (10) and Bryant Jennings (11) as well as Uzbekistan's Ruslan Chagev (14), America's former world champ Bermane Stiverne (15) and Britain's Derek Chisora (18). \nThe continuuing rise of Parker gives his handlers increasing bargaining power as they look to manoeuvre him towards a world title shot within what will be a busy 2016. \nParker heads to Samoa this week to confirm a January fight there. His next assignment is the December 5 Fight For Life in Hamilton. \nOpponents for both those fights are yet to be confirmed and the struggle is finding suitable fighters to take on Parker's fast and increasingly heavy hands. The Kiwi is now unbeaten over 16 fights with 14 KOs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:19:36.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
