Converting opposing turnovers into points has not been a consistent part of the Little Giants' season. \nThrough eight weeks, Ross’ defense has created 21 turnovers, including three interceptions returned for touchdowns. Of the remaining 18 turnovers, Ross’ offense scored on the ensuing possession just four times (22 percent), including two out of four chances against Clay. The Little Giants’ stalled at the 3- and 11-yard lines, respectively, last week. \n“It’s really just more of a matter of will and want-to and pride and saying, ‘I’m just going to make it happen,’ ” Ross coach Craig Yeast said. “We’re still, in some situations, trying to figure out what kind of team we want to be, and I know we played eight games now, but for this team, that’s still a struggle.” \nSJCC holds, and loses, halftime lead \nWhile St. Joseph Central Catholic fell short in its bid to grab its first win of the season Friday night, losing to Crestline 36-22, the Crimson Streaks did manage another first. \nSJCC held the lead at halftime for the first time this season, 14-13, thanks to rushing and receiving touchdowns by Chris Morrisetti. \nFour turnovers (three fumbles, one interception), however, doomed the Crimson Streaks. Crestline scored twice in the third quarter to take a 14-point lead. \nA 34-yard touchdown run by Ross Snyder before the end of the third quarter, brought the Crimson Streaks within six, 28-22. Snyder finished the night with 159 yards rushing. \nCrestline, however, put the game away with a touchdown run with 3:25 remaining. \nSJCC’s 270 yards of total offense was a season-high, as were the Crimson Streaks’ 18 first downs. \nGround game leads Fliers to victory Buy Photo \nClyde's Frank Sewell carries the ball into the endzone during the Fliers homecoming game versus Port Clinton on Friday Ocotber 16, 2015. (Photo: Jessica Denton/News Herald) \nClyde rushed for 331 yards and four touchdowns Friday to top Port Clinton 37-21 and move into a four-way tie atop the Sandusky Bay Conference. \n“We were winning the battle in the trenches,” Fliers running back Frank Sewell said. “We got a good push, and the line was doing their jobs.” \nSewell had 124 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries. Bailey Colson rushed nine times for 63 yards and a score while Jake Jenne added a touchdown on the ground. \nJenne also facilitated the game-changing play as he stood up a Redskins receiver before Joe Bair stole the ball away and ran 75 yards for a touchdown. Clyde led 23-7 moments after Port Clinton was threatening with 12 seconds left in the first half. \nThe Fliers’ victory created a logjam atop the SBC standings. Clyde, Port Clinton, Perkins and Edison each have one loss in the conference. \n“We’ll take it one game at a time,” Sewell said. \nClyde visits Huron in Week 9 while Perkins visits Edison in Week 10. The Redskins play host to Edison in Week 9 and Oak Harbor in Week 10. \nThe News Herald's Matt Horn contributed to this report.
