(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nCONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Allen Park — Cornerback Josh Wilson returned to Lions practice Friday after missing the previous two days due to a concussion.\nAlthough he declined again to provide details on Wilson’s brain injury, coach Jim Caldwell said the Lions are still following the league’s return-to-play protocol for the harmful ailment.\nWith Wilson back, the Lions were nearly at full strength on the practice field. Tight end Brandon Pettigrew (knee/elbow) and linebacker DeAndre Levy (hip) were out, so neither will play in Sunday’s game against the Vikings (1 p.m., FOX).\nCaldwell also declined to say whether running back Joique Bell (ankle) suffered a setback this week. Bell was a full participant Wednesday before being limited Thursday. Although he was on the field for the portion open to the media Friday, his status for Sunday is unclear after he missed the last three games.\nStrong safety James Ihedigbo (quad) practice for the second day in a row, though he was limited Thursday.\nThe team will provide game designations for its injured players later Friday afternoon.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:51:25.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
