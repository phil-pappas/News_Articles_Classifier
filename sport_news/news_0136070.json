But, like anything else, over time the organization got better and started seeing positive results. It's also helped that the manufacturer latched on to some quality organizations that knew how to race … and win. That's definitely the case with JGR.\nAdChoices MORE: Chase standings | Dover schedule | Kenseth wins | Stewart to retire in 2016\nMatt Kenseth, Kyle Busch, Carl Edwards and Denny Hamlin have more than carried the torch for Toyota and, together, have proven to be a team much tougher and more talented this season. At least for this season, teams like Hendrick Motorsports and Stewart-Haas have taken a back seat to JGR.\nThat has been proven over the first two races in the Chase. Last week, Hamlin raced to victory at Chicagoland and punched his ticket to the second round of the Chase. Sunday, it was Kenseth. Check the standings and you'll find Edwards sitting pretty in third place.\nPHOTOS: Cup winners | Gordon's last season | Stockcar Toons photos\nThe only Gibbs driver in any real trouble is Kyle Busch. His early wreck at New Hampshire has put his team in a tough spot in the Chase, where he currently sits 13th, one point outside the final spot to advance to the second round. While it doesn't look good for him, he can still get into the next round, regain focus and join his teammates in the pursuit of the championship.\nThose four drivers have won nine of the last 11 Sprint Cup races, four straight and the last two in the Chase.\nBut things don't look so good for some of the other possible Chase contenders. Find out who they are in our Chase edition of Winners & Losers.\nWinners :\nMatt Kenseth\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 1st\nChase points: 2,099\nPosition: leader\nHe picked up his fifth win of the season, tops among all Sprint Cup drivers, and made a statement with his win. He led only 27 laps but it was his car's speed and strength that stood notice. He pushed leader Kevin Harvick, who dominated with 216 laps led, to the point where he ended up running out of gas trying to keep up with Kenseth.\nDenny Hamlin\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 2nd\nChase points: 2,093\nPosition: second place, -6 back\nHe's performing at his best over the past six races with only one of them outside the top five (sixth at Richmond in the regular-season finale). He led 21 laps at New Hampshire before giving up the lead on Lap 240. Still, he stayed close enough to the front to challenge again for the top spot before Harvick and Kenseth took control late.\nJoey Logano\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 3rd\nChase points: 2,089\nPosition: tied third, -10 back\nThe only driver to break the JGR dominance over the past two months has been Logano. He won at Watkins Glen, and then two weeks later won at Bristol. He continued his success at New Hampshire but didn't lead a lap in the race. Despite that, his Sunday run proved again he'll be a force to reckon with down the stretch, including at Dover, where he has no wins but eight top-10 finishes in 13 career races.\nCarl Edwards\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 5th\nChase points: 2,089\nPosition: tied third, -10 back\nHe overcame a pit road penalty when his dump can got stuck inside the car and he left the pits before it was removed. He led the first 19 laps as the pole sitter but never got to the front again. Despite that, he's sitting good in the points standings and looks solid to advance based on his numbers at Dover (one win, eight top-five finishes, third best average finish at 10.6).\nJimmie Johnson\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 6th\nChase points: 2,083\nPosition: fifth, -16 back\nIf there's anybody that can be considered a lock to advance that hasn't already won a race, it has to be Johnson. With 10 career wins and 20 top-10 finishes at Dover, he's certainly sitting pretty. He's also proven in the two Chase races he'll be around for a while with his overall performance. He overcame a cut tire early at New Hampshire to be near the front of the pack in the end.\nLosers:\nKevin Harvick\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 21st\nChase points: 2,034\nPosition: 15th, -65 behind (-23 from 12th place in Chase)\nLast year's Sprint Cup champion spent all week refusing to talk about his incident with Jimmie Johnson, and then went out at New Hampshire and dominated by leading a race-high 216 laps. Then he ran out of fuel with two laps left trying to catch Kenseth. If they weren't talking about Harvick after Chicagoland, they sure will be now as they enter Dover. Harvick needs a win or something very close (along with a lot of luck) to avoid a first-round elimination.\nKyle Busch\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 37th\nChase points: 2,056\nPosition: 13th, -43 behind (-1 from 12th place in Chase)\nHis early-race misfortune aside, the team did all it could to get points by returning to the track and racing at the end. He is one point outside of advancing to the Chase and does have success at Dover (two wins, 13 top-10 finishes).\nDale Earnhardt Jr.\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 25th\nChase points: 2,057\nPosition: 12th, -42 behind\nHe and his team may be hitting a funk at just the wrong time in the season. He was in the top 10 most of the day at New Hampshire but a trip to pit road put him back in the pack and he never recovered. He seemed to be really hitting a stride as he closed out the regular season with three straight top-10 finishes. He can find his stride again at Dover, where he has a win and 11 top-10 finishes. But his last two finishes there were 17th and 14th. That kind of performance this Sunday could lead to his exit from the Chase.\nClint Bowyer\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 26th\nChase points: 2,018\nPosition: 16th, -81 behind (-39 from 12th place in Chase)\nThe points penalty his team suffered earlier in the week was a devastating blow. The team is appealing the decision but after a not-so-good run at New Hampshire, about the only thing that can save this team is a win Sunday at Dover. His best finish there was fourth in 2014 and he has finished in the top 10 there the past nine races. Still, it likely won't be enough.\nPaul Menard\n© Provided by Sporting News\nSunday's finish: 15th\nChase points: 2,056\nPosition: 14th, -43 behind (-1 from 12th place in Chase)\nYou hate to say “thanks for playing” to any driver with one Chase race left before the next round. But with drivers like Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Clint Bowyer in trouble and needing a win or a good performance to advance, Menard's chances aren't looking good. Although his finish at New Hampshire matched his second-best finish there, he'll need a lot more than that at Dover, where his best finish was seventh in 2010 and eighth in the spring race.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-03-04/2015-nascar-sprint-cup-winners-photos-jimmie-johnson-joey-logano", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-09-27/tony-stewart-retire-retiring-from-nascar-racing-2016", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-03-05/jeff-gordon-retirement-nascar-sprint-cup-photos-2015-daytona-atlanta-talladega", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-09-28/nascar-sprint-cup-dover-aaa-400-time-tv-channel-schedule-online-streaming-information-pole-qualifying-winner", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656521-nascar-sprint-cup-chase-grid-standings-aaa-400-dover-international-speedway-gordon-harvick-kenseth-hamlin-busch", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4631786-stockcartoons-2015-dale-earnhardt-jr-danica-patrick-brad-keselowski-jeff-gordon-fights-wrecks", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-09-27/chase-sprint-cup-new-hampshire-kevin-harvick-matt-kenseth-winner-loudon", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:52:43.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
