This team missed the feeling of winning and wanted to get that feeling back. \n\"Our confidence kept getting stronger throughout the week in practice and then carried over.\" \nLewis caught TD aerials of 41 and 23 yards from Alexander, the Eagles' junior quarterback who also scored on a 1-yard keeper. \nBryson Morris scored on a 23-yard run, Wan-ye Cain scored on an 84-yard pass from Alexander, Brent Willis scored on a 3-yard run and Nic Brooks broke loose for a 58-yard TD. \nApollo, which snapped a five-game losing skid, closes out regular-season play next week at arch-rival Daviess County. \nOwensboro 20, Graves County 19 \nThe visiting Red Devils had to rally from a 16-7 second-half deficit to overcome the upset-minded Eagles in a thriller at Mayfield. \nRanked No. 2 in the state, OHS (8-1, 4-0 Class 5-A Region 1, District 1) pulled within 16-13 at 3:37 of the third period on a 29-yard scoring run by Landon Board. \nA field goal by Rodrigo Garcia rebuilt the Eagles' lead to 19-13 at 8:55 of the fourth, but Owensboro pulled it out when Jahlil Barrett scored on a 16-yard scamper at 5:18 and sophomore Nick Brake drilled what proved to be the game-deciding extra-point. \nIn the first half, Graves County jumped in front 10-0 in the first quarter, before Board scored on a 59-yard run at 8:01 of the second. The Eagles increased their lead to nine points inside the final minute of the half, however, when Trevor Grant snared a 31-yard scoring pass from Ryan Mathis. \nGraves County (4-5, 2-2) out-gained OHS 319-315 in total offense. \nThe Red Devils were led by Board's 213 yards on 24 carries. OHS quarterback Zach Gross completed 6-of-11 passes for 46 yards. \nOwensboro closes out regular-season play next Friday against visiting rival Henderson County at Rash Stadium. \nMcCracken County 57, Muhlenberg County 26 \nDespite his team's lopsided loss to Class 6-A heavyweight McCracken County, Muhlenberg County coach Hays Browning saw signs of life from his offense in a loss at Greenville. \n\"We played pretty well offensively,\" Browning said. \"I'm pretty pleased with the way we moved the ball against a very, very good high school football team.\" \nMuhlenberg County quarterback Hunter Combs threw a pair of touchdown passes â€” 10 yards to Kobe Drake and 80 yards to Jo Jo Peay. \nIn addition, Muhlenberg County got a 5-yard TD run from Devin Evitts and an 80-yard kickoff return for a score from Raeton White. \nMcCracken County improved to 8-1 overall and 4-0 in Class 6-A Region 1, District 1. Muhlenberg County slipped to 4-5, 0-4. \nMuhlenberg County closes out regular-season play next Friday night when it entertains Grayson County at Mustangs Stadium.
