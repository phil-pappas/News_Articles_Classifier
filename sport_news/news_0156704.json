The top six teams in each conference qualify for the postseason.\nSeventh-placed Orlando City (41 points) kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a 2-1 home win over sixth-placed Montreal Impact (42 points).\nEnglish defender Seb Hines volleyed home the winner in the 80th minute and Orlando won despite losing two players early in the first half, after team mates Tommy Redding and Rafael Ramos clashed heads and had to be substituted.\nOrlando still have a mountain to climb. They are only one point behind Montreal with two games left, while the Impact have four matches remaining.\nThe New York Red Bulls stayed top of the East when they beat the Columbus Crew 2-1, with all the goals coming early. Englishmen Lloyd Sam and Bradley Wright-Phillips scored for the Red Bulls after midfielder Justin Meram had put the Crew ahead.\nIn the West, Sporting Kansas took a massive stride towards securing a playoff spot when they beat the Portland Timbers 1-0 thanks to a magnificent goal by Hungarian striker Krisztian Nemeth in the 83rd minute.\nNemeth collected the ball in his own half, and dribbled some 50 yards past several defenders before drilling the ball past the keeper for a goal-of-the-season contender.\nThe win lifts Kansas from fifth to third, with 48 points from 31 games.\nBut the result was a disaster for Portland, which drops from sixth to seventh, overtaken by the San Jose Earthquakes, who drew 1-1 with the Vancouver Whitecaps.\nSan Jose and Portland both have 44 points. San Jose have a better goal difference but Portland have a game in hand.\n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:36:45.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
