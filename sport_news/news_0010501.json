A win over Ole Miss — which is also a regional rival — would help the Tigers make the case that they’re the best program from the group of five conferences. The Rebels could use a win to gain momentum for a five-game stretch against Southeastern Conference opponents to end the regular season. \nKEY MATCHUP \nMemphis QB Paxton Lynch vs. Mississippi’s defense. Ole Miss DB Mike Hilton called Lynch one of the nation’s best-kept secrets after watching film this week. Lynch has been superb this year, throwing for 1,535 yards, 10 touchdowns and no interceptions. His 70.5 percent completion percentage ranks third nationally. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nOle Miss: DB Trae Elston. The senior safety has been the Rebels’ biggest defensive playmaker this season. He has a team-high four interceptions, including two that were returned for touchdowns. \nMemphis: WR Mose Frazier. The veteran has been Lynch’s favorite target this season, catching 21 passes for 279 yards and two touchdowns. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nMemphis fourth-year coach Justin Fuente has a 22-20 record with the Tigers.
