John Farrell was discharged from the hospital today after completing the third of three 21-day cycles of chemotherapy. â€” Gordon Edes (@GordonEdes) October 1, 2015 \nFarrell announced his cancer diagnosis on Aug. 14 and his absent from the team during the treatment process. Now, as Farrell emerges from his treatment for Stage 1 lymphoma, one big issue remains for the team: Will he return to manage in 2016? \nThere are three games left in the 2015 season for the Red Sox, who finish on the road against the Cleveland Indians. Interim manager Torey Lovullo is set to finish those three games at the helm. \nAs for the future, president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski has been adamant that the organization is focusing on him getting healthy and that. According to multiple reports , the team does plan to have Farrell return as manager once he's completely recovered. \nFarrell has finished treatments, but likely won't get an all-clear until he goes in for a scan at the end of the month . \nIn the meantime, the team is in a conundrum. The Red Sox have have performed well with Torey Lovullo at the helm, but have made it clear that the only option is to restore Farrell's role. However, it could mean that Lovullo winds up as a manager elsewhere in the majors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:50:51.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
