Anthony Grant added 94 yards and touchdown, while Christian Turner put up 60 yards. Joshua Blackwell also rushed for 41 yards and a score. Buford finished with total 412 yards -- while holding North Hall to 77. \nThe Trojans (2-4, 1-2) were led by 21 yards rushing from Jackson Madonna. \nNorth Hall yielded just 14 first half points but could not keep pace. \nThe Trojans will look to bounce back next week against Madison County on the road. \nBuford will play host to Monroe Area next week.
