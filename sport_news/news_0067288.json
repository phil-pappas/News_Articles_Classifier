Caretakers decided to euthanize the bear due to her advanced age and poor prognosis for returning to a good quality of life.\nKlondike, who had been the oldest polar bear in the country, will be \"greatly missed,\" general curator Kevin Murphy said in a statement.\n\"In addition to the joy she brought guests over more than three decades, she has been an important ambassador to wild polar bears, who are increasingly threatened by climate change and resulting shrinkage of polar ice,\" he said.\nKlondike was born at the Bronx Zoo in November 1980.\nThe Philadelphia Zoo has one remaining polar bear, 34-year-old Coldilocks, who is now the oldest in the nation. Polar bears in zoos typically live to about 24 years of age.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:16:06.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
