Shea Friday night highlights: Week 9 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nClear Creek and Clear Springs are separated by five miles along FM 518 in League City. That's helped fuel a rivalry - and give it a name that rolls nicely off the tongue. \nThis season, the Fight for 518 went to Clear Creek, who moved to 8-0 with a 49-34 win Friday night. \nThe Wildcats remain tied atop District 24-6A with Dickinson, which is also 8-0 and 5-0 in league play. \nDickinson beat Friendswood 27-20, keeping the Mustangs tied with Clear Springs for third place. Both are 4-4 and 3-2 in district. \nClear Creek jumped out to an early 14-0 lead before the Chargers could get in the end zone midway through the second quarter. Clear Creek answered with 23 seconds before the break however, taking a 21-6 lead into the break. \nThe offenses went back and forth in the second half, but Clear Creek kept its lead to give the team its third straight win over the Chargers. \nClear Springs leads the overall series 5-3. \nClear Creek quarterback Chase Hildreth threw for 293 yards and two touchdowns. Da'Von Smith had 272 yards of offense and five scores. \n\nMavericks shut down Tompkins \nA game that drew attention beyond the borders of Greater Houston quickly turned into nothing more than Morton Ranch taking it to Katy ISD's newest team. \nMorton Ranch forced a pair of turnovers early and never looked back, beating Tompkins 21-0 at Rhodes. \nHad Tompkins won, the Falcons, in just their second season, would have had the inside track to the fourth playoff spot in District 19-6A behind Katy, Cinco Ranch and Strake Jesuit. That would have sent Tompkins and Strake Jesuit to 6A's Division II bracket and Katy to Division I - where a possible finals matchup between three-time defending champion Allen had many across Texas salivating. \nBut instead, Morton Ranch and Tompkins are 2-3 in district play behind those three and could be joined in a tie for fourth place by Seven Lakes (1-3), which plays winless Mayde Creek on Saturday. \nMorton Ranch's defense held Tompkins to 108 yards of total offense while collecting four sacks and forcing three turnovers. \nOn offense, Dartaviouis Dixon ran for a score and threw for another. \n\nEl Campo beats rival Bay City \nIn one of the stats's oldest rivalries, El Campo extended its streak over Bay City, getting five rushing touchdowns from Kevin Dove in a 41-14 win. \nThe rivalry is the oldest continuous series in the state, as the two met for the 96th consecutive year. In all, El Campo and Bay City have played 112 times. \nEl Campo owns a 60-43-9 edge over the Blackcats. \nDarryl Florez (33-yard run) and La'Darrion Florez (95-yard kickoff return) scored Bay City's two scores. \n\nDickinson player flown to hospital \nA Dickinson football player who was flown to a hospital for an injury suffered during a game Friday is doing OK, Dickinson coach John Snelson said late Friday. \nSnelson said linebacker Mitchell Butler suffered a neck injury in against Friendswood. Snelson said Butler was taken to the hospital for precautionary reasons. \n\nPending rain changes schedule \nMother Nature - or the threat of inclement weather - has shuffled nearly the entire Saturday schedule for the Houston area, which has gotten off lucky compared to its neighbors to the north. \nWeek 9 games in the Dallas-Fort Worth area have been suspended, postponed and rescheduled since Thursday. As a result, some games were played Friday morning and afternoon as teams scrambled to find game officials. \nIn Houston, every Saturday game except Barbers Hill and Humble has changed times or locations. The earliest two begin at 10 a.m. - Aldine Davis faces Eisenhower at Thorne in a first-place showdown and Katy takes on Strake Jesuit at Tully. \nSeven others kick off at 11 a.m.: Cypress Ranch-Cypress Falls (Berry Center), Langham Creek-Jersey Village (Pridgeon), Cinco Ranch-Seven Lakes (Rhodes), Bellaire-Sam Houston (Cowart), Milby-Chavez (Barnett), Westbury-Lamar (Delmar) and Sharpstown-Madison (Butler). \nYates and Davis meet at 1 p.m. at Dyer, while Travis faces Elsik an hour later at Crump. At. 2:30 p.m., Washington and Wheatley meet at Barnett. \nAs of Friday night, Barbers Hill and Humble were set for 6 p.m. on Saturday at Turner, but school officials could make a decision by the afternoon. \n\nBearkats shock Klein Oak \nKlein upset Klein Oak 31-26 in a shootout Friday night. After a slow start, both teams exploded in the second quarter with five total touchdowns. The second half was a scoreless stalemate until the Klein pulled away with 10:21 left to play and held on despite a late comeback attempt from the Panthers. \nThis Bearkats' win, along with Westfield defeating Dekaney and Montgomery falling to Klein Collins , tightens the race for the fourth seed in District 15-6A. Klein Oak had the edge, but finds itself in a three-way tie with Klein and Montgomery. \nKlein faces Dekaney next week, while Klein Oak and Montgomery will duke it out. \nFrom staff reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:34:32.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
