We didn’t even know it until we got back to the school [last weekend].” \nNorthgate will now host Winder Bar- row, which swept Chapel Hill, in the Sweet 16. The Lady Bulldogs finished third out of Area 8- . \nBottled up in a talented area alignment for years with Fayette County schools McIntosh, Starr’s Mill and former rival Whitewater, home playoff matches have been a rarity for Northgate despite reaching the Class AAAA Final Four in 2010. \nWalker, though, watched the Lady Vikings settle into a groove after working through some early adrenaline. \nDruid Hills took its largest lead early in the first set, breaking a 4-4 tie with six consecutive points. Northgate erased the deficit just as quickly with kills from Kia Thomas and Katie Stanton as Dozier served through a 6-0 run while posting an ace. \n“We’re a team that takes a little while to get going,” said Walker, who saw the Lady Vikings rally back to beat Ola in the first of four consecutive matches on Saturday to close the Area 4- tournament. “That first win last week- end against Ola. When we got down and came back I told the girls, we can win this thing.” \nDruid Hills, the No. 4 seed out of Area 2- continued to scrap through the opener, tying the match at 12-12 and continuing to stay close until an ace by Stanton sparked another five-point surge. Richard posted two more of her team-high 10 kills during the run. \nA pretty combination from Matthews to Moore in the middle coming off a dig by Cara Rhoad seemed to light a spark, pushing Northgate’s lead to 20-14 while closing the opening set with eight more unanswered points. \nFrom there, Moore took over in set two, adding to her nine kills and dominating the middle of the net en route to adding four blocks in the sweep. \n“She’s our sparkplug,” said Walker of Moore, who has verbally committed to Troy while joining her older brother, a freshman swimmer at North Carolina State, as a Division I signee in February. “She doesn’t have to be loud. But when she talks to the girls, you can tell she has their attention.” \nNorthgate cruised to a 10-0 lead with Thomas, Hannah Smith, Adrianna Ballard, Eden Smith and Dozier all rotating in among a starting lineup of Moore, Hannah Smith, Richard, Stanton, Marshall and Rhoad. \nAt libero, Rhoad with nine digs to lead the defensive effort, which carried into game three.
