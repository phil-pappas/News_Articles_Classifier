Namibia were hemmed back deep into their own half, but escaped the concession of a try when Alexander Todua crashed over in the corner. \nReferee George Clancy adjudged Malaguradze to have knocked on when he stripped the ball from Darryl de la Harpe. It was a harsh call. \nA brief venture into Georgian territory was rewarded when Kotze kicked a second penalty following a high tackle from Viktor Kolelishvili on Renaldo Bothma. \nA forearm smash by Jaba Bregvadze on Namibia replacement Heinrich Smit saw the Georgia hooker sin-binned. \nThe short-handed Georgia pack still dominated, but time and again they stumbled short of the Namibia line, through a combination of poor handling, indiscipline and resilient defence. And then a series of Clancy decisions. \nA high tackle by Tjiueee Uanivi on Gorgodze resulted in a penalty, while Raoul Larson was sin-binned for a cynical infringement as Namibia continually conceded penalties. \nNine minutes of time was added at the end of the half, but Clancy appeared to miss the chance to blow sooner after a crooked lineout throw-in. \nBregvadze returned to the field in the fifth minute of added time, giving Georgia the numerical advantage at the scrum and Larson's replacement Johannes Coetzee was sin-binned for three straight set-piece penalties. \nWith no Namibian tighthead, scrums became uncontested and Georgia were frustrated when Kolelishvili had a try ruled out for a forward pass from Gorgodze. \nGeorgia resumed where they left off and pummelled Namibia up front before Gorgodze crashed over from close range. \nBothma received Namibia's third yellow card for tackling Malaguradze round the neck in the build-up and Kvirikashvili converted. Malaguradze ghosted through for a second try after a bullocking run and fine offload by Giorgi Tkhilaishvili. \nKvirikashvili kicked a penalty to extend Georgia's advantage to 11 points with 12 minutes remaining. Kotze replied with his third penalty and then crashed over in the corner after Namibia showed their forward might before spreading the ball wide. \nHis conversion meant there was one point in it, but Georgia held on and will now watch events from Newcastle with interest.
