Teams talking like friendly rivals By Cam Inman Posted: 10/21/2015 01:16:41 PM PDT Updated: 10/21/2015 05:16:10 PM PDT SANTA CLARA -- Hatred and grudges were branded into the 49ers-Seattle Seahawks rivalry during their battles for NFC supremacy. Bones were broken, knee ligaments torn, words shouted and playoff plans altered. \nThat was then. This is now. \nThe 49ers and Seahawks both take 2-4 records and humbler tones into Thursday night's meeting at Levi's Stadium. \nTwice a year, this NFC West rivalry evolves. But is it still escalating? How big is it? \n\"Not big at all,\" Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman told Seattle reporters. \"Because we don't think of any game as a rivalry, any team as a rival. Every game is just the next opponent.\" San Francisco 49ers' Eric Reid (35) celebrates San Francisco 49ers' Michael Wilhoite's (57) interception against the Baltimore Ravens in the second quarter of their NFL game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015. (Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nYes, that's the same Richard Sherman who shouted the 49ers off the NFC Championship stage 21 months ago, taunting Michael Crabtree, Colin Kaepernick and then-coach Jim Harbaugh after the Seahawks' 23-17 home win. \nBut there's also a soft side to Sherman and the Seahawks that the 49ers have come to know and respect, as much as that contradicts a bitter-rivals storyline. \nWhen linebacker NaVorro Bowman tore multiple knee ligaments late in that Jan. 19, 2014 defeat, his well wishers included his on-field enemies in blue helmets. \n\"I had a lot of guys come up to me and catch me after the game,\" Bowman recalled recently. \"In the (2014) offseason, I ran into Sherman and Russell (Wilson), and they wished me the best.\" Advertisement \nPerhaps that's why Bowman insisted there is no special motivation -- \"not at all\" -- for Thursday night's reunion against the same team he got hurt against, with a Super Bowl berth on the line. \n\"This league is really friendly off the field, and that's what you want,\" Bowman said. \"You want guys to play their heart out on the field and give respect where it's due off the field.\" \nFive of Bowman's former 49ers teammates are on the Seahawks: linebacker Nick Moody, fullback Will Tukuafu, defensive end Demarcus Dobbs, and wide receivers B.J. Daniels and Ricardo Lockette. \nLockette remains close friends with Kaepernick. They were roommates before the 49ers cut ties before the 2013 season with Lockette, who landed in Seattle and has played on their back-to-back NFC-winning teams. \n\"I'm not rooting against him because he's in Seattle. That's my friend,\" Kaepernick said. \"I have a lot of friends on Seattle's team. I don't wish them any ill will because of that. \n\"I hope they all do well,\" Kaepernick added. \" ... We'll go out, we'll play, we'll try to win the game. At the end of the game, we're still friends.\" \nEven Seahawks coach Pete Carroll sounded as if he'll miss competing against Harbaugh, his fiery nemesis dating back to their USC-vs.-Stanford days. \n\"I'm not looking at it any differently,\" Carroll said of the 49ers-Seahawks rivalry. \"But he's a terrific coach, and it was a lot of fun playing against him.\" \nWhat's Carroll's deal with hoarding so many former 49ers? He said both franchises have similar styles: they like to run the football and play tough defense. Neither team has played up to those 2011-14 standards, however. \nThe 49ers snapped a four-game losing streak Sunday by outlasting the Baltimore Ravens 25-20. That victory wasn't decided until Joe Flacco's 53rd and final throw fell incomplete against the league's last-ranked pass defense. \nThe Seahawks are coming off a rare home loss, 27-23 to the Carolina Panthers after blowing a fourth-quarter lead. Miscommunication among Seattle's \"Legion of Boom\" secondary gave way to Greg Olsen's last-minute touchdown catch for the Panthers. \nSeattle's defensive collapse did little to tarnish their image among the 49ers. \n\"Their strategy is extremely smart and they play it well,\" 49ers guard Alex Boone said. \"They're all good at what they do. You load up that box and sometimes things can be difficult for offenses and especially offensive lines.\" \nThe Seahawks lost their final five trips to Candlestick Park before beating the 49ers at Levi's Stadium 19-3 last Thanksgiving Night. The resulting scene made for quite the visual scar: Sherman and Russell Wilson eating turkey legs on the field as part of NBC's postgame set. \nBoone downplayed any notion of revenge, saying: \"That's just the media making it more than it is.\" \nPerhaps the same could be said of the 49ers-Seahawks series, which is teetering between a grudge match and friendly rivalry. \n\"There's always been a little beef between us and them,\" Boone added. \"It makes it more fun, and, really, it's just a physical game.\" \nRunning back Carlos Hyde (foot), wide receiver Anquan Boldin (hamstring) and right tackle Erik Pears (back) are the only 49ers listed as questionable. All other injured 49ers are listed as probable, including running back Reggie Bush and wide receiver Bruce Ellington, who missed Sunday's win over the Ravens with calf injuries. \nFormer 49ers linebacker Moody (ankle) is among five players ruled out by the Seahawks. Linebacker Bobby Wagner (pectoral) is likely to return from a one-game absence, as he's listed as probable, along with running back Marshawn Lynch (hamstring), defensive end Cliff Avril (ankle), safety Kam Chancellor (shoulder), cornerback Sherman (ankle) and wide receiver Tyler Lockett (hip). \nSammy Hagar is to perform at halftime, and Tony Lindsay, of Santana fame, will sing the national anthem. Stadium parking lots open at 1:55 p.m. For more on the 49ers, see Cam Inman's Hot Read blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers .
