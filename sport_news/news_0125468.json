The only points before intermission also came from Williams as he scored on an 8-yard run and then added the conversion run with 40 seconds left in the first quarter.\n  But Williams went to the well once two often while in punting possession and his gaffe early in the third almost immediately led to the first points of the night by Davis (8-0, 5-0).\nOn a fourth-and-20 from Hunter's own 18 in the third quarter, Williams ran another fake but was nabbed instead for a 1-yard loss. Two plays later, Smith scored on a 13-yard TD run.\n\"I think [Williams] was so excited that he didn't think about the situation,\" Hunter coach Scott Henderson said. \"You know, it's teenagers and they're going to do that, but I'm proud of my kids. They played well and Davis played a hell of a game.\"\nDavis scored on a 2-yard run by Nick Roberts to go ahead 14-8 with 3:24 left in the third. The play was set up when Darts' receiver Mitch Nelson, at the end of a 40-yard pass by Davis quarterback Kallin Fisher, tore the ball away from Hunter defensive back David Mapa.\n\"I think we both came down with it,\" Nelson said. \"I just stripped it away as hard as I could.\"\nMapa got his revenge soon, however. Hunter quarterback McKay Meidlinger hit him for an 80-yard touchdown and the visitors led, 15-14.\nBut Davis went ahead to stay when Smith, who finished with 120 yards rushing, scored from 3 yards out early in the fourth after Davis passed up a field goal to start the fourth and kept the drive alive on a fourth-down run by Smith.\n\"I thought our defense was playing really well and we had some momentum,\" Darts coach Tyler Gladwell said. \"I thought if we didn't get it, there was still plenty of time left in the game. We were running the ball real successfully and I was confident we could (convert).\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:15:54.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
