Former Lakers coach Phil Jackson made Odom his first roster move as Knicks president when he signed him for the final day of the regular season in 2013-14 with a non-guaranteed deal in place for 2014-15. Jackson released Odom in July 2014 when he failed to show up at the Tarrytown facility to begin working out.\nPhil Jackson with Fisher and Odom.

If Odom survives, Fisher hopes the incident could turn around a life that’s been derailed by drug addiction.\n“It’s difficult news to hear,’’ Fisher said. “Obviously very personal to me. I think that oftentimes athletes, celebrities are judged by choices or decisions, and that’s not representative of who they are.\n“Lamar Odom was one of the greatest people I’ve ever known. That’s the way I see him. I don’t see him through the prism of choices he has made. I view him through the heart and soul of the person he really is. I’m obviously hoping he can pull through this, [and] in some fortunate way, this becomes the beginning of a different ending.’’\nOdom’s former Lakers teammate Sasha Vujacic is now with the Knicks, and former Lakers assistants Kurt Rambis and Jim Cleamons are part of the coaching staff. Carmelo Anthony was a teammate of Odom’s on the US Olympic Team in 2004 in Athens, and their families were friendly.\n“Just everyone’s happiness and wellbeing was always more important to him,’’ Fisher said. “That he was always willing to sacrifice his own opportunities, minutes, shots, at times he sacrifices other things in life to do for everyone else. Sometimes it left him in last place. That’s the type of person he is.’’\nOdom and Carmelo Anthony during the 2004 Olympics. Photo: AP Fisher got emotional, and paused, when asked what kind of basketball player Odom was.\n“I want to be careful not to say ‘was’ too many times,’’ Fisher said. “He’s still here. That means a lot to me. From a basketball standpoint, he’s an amazing teammate, amazing player that possesses all the skills necessary to do anything on the floor you needed done.\n“His defense and rebounding was more spectacular than what he could do with the basketball offensively. He was as close to the top reasons we won championships in 2009 and ’10.’’\nAnthony was downcast.\n“It’s sad,” Anthony said. “I’ve known him personally since high school. He’s a friend of mine. It’s a sad situation. To see where he was at as a player or person and see where he’s at right now, all you can do is pray for him and his family.\n“Last year Phil tried to bring him in. We reached out. My family is close to his family. We tried to reach out.’’\nAnthony remembers admiring Odom’s high school career at Christ the King.\n“Lamar was a point forward, 6-10 coming out of high school,’’ Anthony said. “A lot of people will tell you, he was one of my favorite players coming out of high school, one of the best high school players I’ve ever seen as a kid. That position, to be able to do the things he was able to do on the basketball court — to play the point guard, bring the ball up, defend 1 through 5. He had a multi-faceted game.’’\nWhen Jackson waived Odom in last summer, he released a statement: “Unfortunately, Lamar was unable to uphold the standards to return as an NBA player. We found it necessary to free up the roster spot.”\nJackson was not made available for comment Wednesday. Fisher was asked if he was disappointed it didn’t work out with Odom as a Knick.\n“Not from a basketball standpoint,” Fisher said. “Lamar’s health was my No. 1 concern. Any disappointment was totally personal in terms of not whether he plays basketball again, just his overall health. I know he wanted to get back on the court at some point. It’s always been about his health.’’\nVujacic played six seasons with Odom.\n“We’re rooting for him,’’ Vujacic said. “I think he will win this battle. He’s guy with a heart of gold.’’\n carmelo anthony , derek fisher , lamar odom , los angeles lakers , new york knicks , phil jackson , sasha vujacic", "external_links": ["http://pagesix.com/2015/10/14/lamar-odom-had-cocaine-in-system-track-marks-on-arm/?_ga=1.10479537.582497728.1405961468", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/odom3.jpg", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/odom2.jpg?w=295&#038;h=300", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/odom3.jpg?w=231&#038;h=300", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/odom2.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:15:25.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
