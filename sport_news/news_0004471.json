He limped Wednesday as he took part in some drills. \nThe Dolphins' offensive line was woeful without Albert in Sunday's 41-14 loss to the Bills. Miami plays the Jets in London on Sunday. \nTight end Dion Sims (concussion) did not practice. Tight end Jordan Cameron (groin) and defensive tackle Earl Mitchell (back) were limited with lingering injuries. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:19:24.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
