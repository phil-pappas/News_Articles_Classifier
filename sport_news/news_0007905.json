They've been in a shootout and spent time in the military. But last Thursday, they were wearing suits when they arrived at the school just outside their city. Neither had bullet-proof vests.\nThey happened to be among the closest to the school when they heard the call come over the police radio about 10:38 a.m:\n\"Somebody is outside one of the doors, shooting through the door ... we do have one female that has been shot at this time. We're still attempting to get further ...,\" the dispatcher said.\nWhen the detectives arrived, they knew the shooter was in a Snyder Hall classroom. They knew he may have a long gun. And they knew about 35 people were scattered throughout the building with him.\nThey parked to the southeast of the hall at 10:44 a.m. They heard several shots as they approached.\nThe gunman was firing shots through the windows from inside the classroom.\nThey used their police car and other cars in the lot for cover and moved toward the shots. They saw the shooter, Christopher Harper-Mercer, standing right outside the classroom. They saw the muzzle on his 9 mm handgun flash.\n***\nDouglas County District Attorney Rick Wesenberg called them heroes. He said what they did next at the college saved lives.\nAnimated representation of police response to Umpqua Community College shooting This simple animation reconstructs the police response to the Umpqua Community College shooting, from the first 911 call at 10:38 a.m. to the report of \"suspect down\" at 10:48 a.m.\nBut Kaney and Spingath don't want to be called heroes, their chief said. They don't want the focus on them.\nNine people died inside Snyder Hall and another nine were injured.\nWesenberg released details of the encounter with the 26-year-old gunman during a news conference Wednesday at the Police Department in Roseburg. His account, along with police records and statements, provide some insight into what happened when the detectives headed into Oregon's deadliest mass shooting.\n\"I want everyone to know of the selfless acts of these officers in responding to the scene,'' Wesenberg said. \"They had little regard for their own personal safety. They saved many lives that day in their heroic acts.''\n***\n\"We're exchanging shots with him,\" Kaney radioed at 10:46 a.m.\nThe detectives fired three times from their .40-caliber hanguns at Harper-Mercer, striking him once in his right side. They were about 15 yards away. No words passed between the cops and Harper-Mercer.\nThe gunman retreated into the classroom. He walked up to the front and shot himself in the head.\nThe detectives approached the classroom from the east. State Police Sgt. Lynn Withers came from the west.\n\"Suspect is down,\" Withers told dispatch at 10:48 a.m.\nHarper-Mercer was lying next to an assault rifle and a dark-colored flak jacket, lined with steel plates and packed with five magazines of ammunition. He had used a handgun in his rampage.\n***\nState police investigated Kaney and Spingath's actions that morning â€“ standard in police-involved shootings. District Attorney Wesenberg reviewed the report and determined that their gunfire was justified.\nWesenberg didn't specify how many rounds each detective fired or the number of shots Harper-Mercer fired at them. It's still unclear which detective shot Harper-Mercer.\nPolice didn't release further details about Harper-Mercer at their news conference. They focused solely on Kaney, a detective sergeant, and Spingath, a detective who works in Kaney's Criminal Investigation Division.\nThe detectives are trying to fall back into their routines, said Chief Jim Burge Jr. They don't want to be in the news.\n\"They feel they are only first responders who got there first and did a job they were trained and entrusted to do,\" he said.\nThey plan to return to duty this week.\n-- Rebecca Woolington\nrwoolington@oregonian.com\n503-294-4049; @rwoolington\n--Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212; @maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://blog.advance.net/cgi-bin/mte/%22mailto:mberstein@oregonian.com", "https://blog.advance.net/cgi-bin/mte/%22https://twitter.com/maxoregonian", "https://twitter.com/rwoolington"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:55:13.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
