Her mother was a musician and fostered Ford’s interest in vocal music. The center of her music activities as a child was her church, where she began singing in the choir. At the age of twelve this talented young girl was singing solos. Following graduation from high school, Ford attended Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, where she studied voice with Frances Scott. \nFord continued participation in church choirs following her graduation from OBU and met her husband in a church choir. As they moved from place to place, they always joined a church and choir. The last 30 years were spent in Mandeville, La., prior to discovering Hot Spring Village in 2006. In 2012, they bought a house and are now living in HSV following Ford’s retirement from her 20-year career as a high school librarian. Ford states, “I really enjoy singing with a quality group like the Village Chorale.” \nEllen Nagode, Music Director of the Chorale, is always interested in hearing from anyone who would like to audition for this premier group. The annual holiday/Christmas concert will be presented in Woodlands Auditorium Dec. 8 at 7:30 p.m. Prior to the fall season-ending concert, the Chorale will appear in a Garvan Gardens concert Dec.1 and with the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra Dec. 6 at 3 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:42:26.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
