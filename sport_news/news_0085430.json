I know they're disappointed and they wanted to shoot better today, but we had a great year. I've had great senior leadership, and our kids all get along. That makes it so much easier when you coach. We've just had a rough two days here, but who didn't? The weather wasn't anybody's friend.\" \nScioto Valley Conference Player of the Year Peyton Cooper led the way on day two by shooting an 85. He was followed by teammates Jacob Calvin (88), Scott Freeman (89), Cole Karr (94) and Bane Adkins (96). \nCoopers’ two-day total of 166 also led the team, while Freeman carded a 172, Calvin shot a 182, Adkins managed a 184 and Karr finished with a 187. \nThose scores put the finishing touches on a season in which the Tanks won their seventh straight SVC title as well as sectional and district crowns. \n“This whole season has been great for our whole team,\" Cooper said. \"Coming out and winning sectionals and districts, qualifying for state and coming up here and getting this experience has been pretty awesome.\" \nCooper, individually, had a great year as well. The senior won individual conference, sectional and district titles while leading the Shermans with a nine hole average of 36.3. \n\"I've had a great season,\" Cooper said. \"Coming (to Sunbury), I kind of wanted to make all-Ohio, but in the end, it's always good just to be here. And to win titles like I have throughout the year, it's just awesome to finally see your hard work pay off.\" \nCooper, along with seniors Adkins and Freeman, will end their high school golf careers having won four consecutive conference and sectional titles. \n\"I couldn't ask for anything more,\" Adkins said. \"We've had a pretty dominant run and have represented 'The U' very well. Unioto golf is just something amazing. We've been able to take it so far so many times, and I'm very proud of our team. One thing we've had this year is leadership. That's taken us a long way.\" \nNext year, leadership will be sought after in Cole Karr, who will return to the team as a senior. \n\"I tried my best today,\" Karr said. \"I'm not really happy with what I shot, but this is a tough course. But I'll have the same goal next year, to get to the state tournament. I'm going to work harder, and I think we have a good chance to make it back here. This year, we just went out with a bang, and I want that to happen in my senior year as well.\" 19 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1ROWSRb TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:30:51.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
