But the fit wasn't right and Lee decided to transfer to James Madison. The Dukes' head coach is Everett Withers, the former North Carolina coach who had tried to convince Lee to become a Tar Heel. \n\"He does a lot of good things leadership wise to help this football team,\" Withers said. \"He's a really good football player who has a lot of those intangibles that you like in a leader.\" \nAnd he has the right talent you look for in a quarterback. In an upset at SMU, Lee had 565 yards of total offense. This past Saturday, a modest 264 yards of total offense in the win at Elon. \nBut the game was just as special as SMU because Lee got to play in front of so many friends and family. \n\"It's a special feeling coming back home and playing,\" Lee said. \"Every time I come home, I seem to have success.\" \nLee has never lost a college game he has played in his home state of North Carolina. He's a perfect 4-0 with over 1,000 yards of total offense and 14 touchdowns. No matter where Lee goes, the spotlight follows. \n\"It's something I didn't expect, but nothing really catches me off guard any more because I've been up and I've been down,\" Lee said. \nThe arrow is currently pointing up from an individual and team standpoint. James Madison is 7-0 and ranked 4th in the nation at the FCS level. They will also be the backdrop for this week's ESPN College Gameday. \n\"We focus on us mostly,\" Lee said. \"We feel like if we take care of us and do our job description then we'll be fine.\" Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:56:28.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
