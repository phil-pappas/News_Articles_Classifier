Flutie, a redshirt freshman, has started the last three games. However, both Flutie and Smith have played extensively since the Eagles lost starter Darius Wade for the year to a broken left ankle in a 14-0 loss to Florida St. in the season’s third week. Addazio said that he wants to settle on one quarterback for this weekend’s games. \n“I am going to settle on one quarterback. I'm going to announce that later in the week,” he said. “As I said from the beginning, [rotating quarterbacks] wasn't what I wanted to do, but it's what I needed to do to amply figure out which guy [would start]. First, I wanted to get experience for both of them and also I needed to see if one of them could really separate [himself]. So until that point, that's what we thought was best. I think now we're getting to that point where we're going to settle in a bit and see where that brings us right now. That's where it is.” \nBoston College has scored just seven points in three ACC games, and Addazio said the Eagles won’t get a break this week in playing a “sensational” Clemson defense. \n\"We are not scoring points right now. But you have to look at [whether] you're a long way away or a little bit away. Right now, I'd say we're a little bit away,” he said. “Now, that little bit can be grand, especially when you're playing the defenses that we're playing. We're talking about a top-10 defense, a top-20 defense, a top-15 defense. We are playing some of the finest. This defense we are playing this week is sensational. That's not coach speak. They just are. Put that in perspective for a minute now. We're going to go down there and play a great defense on their home field on a Saturday night, one of the hardest places to play in America. \n“That's a fact. I'm not complaining about it. It's just what it is. You have to think that through a little bit. It's all a part of it. Just like Duke's defense was in the top 20 when we played them. They're a top-25 team right now. We had a great opportunity to beat Duke in a lot of fronts. Wake Forest's defense was ranked in the top 25. Florida State's defense was in the top 10. We are measuring ourselves against some pretty good foes right now, which, when you're struggling, that combination sometimes can be a bit overwhelming. But that will all come through.” Rate this Story: Send Feedback to Nikki Hood: Email | Comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:16:21.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
