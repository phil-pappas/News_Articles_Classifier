The announcer even called Ferrell “the leader.” He didn’t dance or goof around as much as some other players. He threw a few t-shirts and calmly joined his teammates.\nThis is his final season at IU. And the crowd loves him.\nMy personal favorite moment came when Ferrell went up to perform in the 3-point shooting contest. A boy no older than 10 years old leapt up from his seat in the south corner of Assembly Hall and pointed towards the court. His father had to give him a slight tug backwards to prevent him falling over the row in front of him.\nThe point of all of this is Ferrell will be under a huge spotlight this year, and there will be pressure to perform well. There has never been much doubt Ferrell can play with the best of them. It comes down to a matter of how well the team does under his leadership.\nBut now for the fun stuff.\nBryant steals the show\nFreshman center Thomas Bryant comes into this season with as much hype and expectations to fill a certain role as any freshman since Cody Zeller. Most of what we have heard before Saturday, though, was hearsay and narratives provided by coaches and players that he is a true energy guy.\nThose narratives were more than just narratives. He is a blast.\nIt started with the team dance skit that at one point involved a chest-to-chest dance off between Bryant and fellow freshman O.G. Anunoby.\nIt escalated with Bryant’s personal introduction, which concluded with Bryant bringing down the house to The Sugarhill Gang’s “Apache.” His million-dollar smile radiated as he lowered to his squat position and rotated around while “Tonto, jump on it. Jump on it” blared.\nIt was not just his personality, though. Bryant’s interior game seemed remarkably polished for a freshman as he scored consistently down low, and he flew down the court with the energy of a wing player.\nThe icing on the cake? IU Coach Tom Crean pulled him aside afterward to work individually with Bryant on his perimeter defense.\nBryant can be a special player for IU. At the very least, he will be an impact player.\nWho takes the dance-off?\nIn terms of players, I actually give the victory to Bryant’s “Apache” performance.\nBut overall, it’s a no-brainer. Women’s basketball coach Teri Moren dominated the evening when she “Hit the Quan,” with transfer guard Tia Elbert.\nMoren didn’t just go through the motions out there. She absolutely brought out the dance moves and held nothing back. When she performed the fake rifle fire part of the dance, I nearly fell backward from my press row seat.\nI covered Moren last season on the women’s basketball beat, and I did not see that coming. Blew me away.\nHonorable mentions were senior forward and Michigan transfer Max Bielfeldt banging his head to “What is Love?” like in the movie, “A Night at the Roxbury” and Anunoby performing Drake’s dance from the “Hotline Bling” music video.\nAll in all, it was Hoosier Hysteria. We didn’t learn much in terms of basketball, but were able to enjoy some fun moments. Now, let’s hope opening day comes sooner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:10:08.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
