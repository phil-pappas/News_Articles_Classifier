Los Angeles (83-76) is a game behind the Astros and tied with Minnesota, which beat Cleveland 4-2. \nHolland (4-3) allowed three hits and three runs in 6 1-3 innings for his first win since Sept. 5. \nShort URL : http://wtaw.com/?p=99414 Weather info for College Station STAY UPDATED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:15:24.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
