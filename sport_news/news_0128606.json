The Chelsea man fired a high effort at goal but a vital block from Serhiy Rybalka diverted his effort off target. \nAsmir Begovic was soon called into action twice in quick succession, palming behind a Derlis Gonzalez effort from a tight angle, before flicking the Kiev man's cross away with Aleksandar Dragovic racing in to meet it. \nBut as the game went on, the tempo seemed to drop massively and both sides looked content with the draw. \nThe hosts produced some good pressure late on, but it was Chelsea who nearly won it in stoppage time with a sweeping counter which ended with a curling Willian effort which whistled just past the far post. \nChelsea stay third in Group G having failed to win their two away games in the competition so far, but Mourinho will be buoyed by a much-improved team display ahead of their meeting with Kiev at Stamford Bridge in two weeks.
