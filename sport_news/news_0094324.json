We know there’s some things we have to work on to get better, and we have to make sure we hit all those things. We’re still trying to get better every week and I think that has to start with our focus. “(The short week) is tough. You basically lose your walk-through on Thursday. Our guys are still sore from Monday, so you’re not going with a regular practice on Thursday, but it’s not a walk-through either. It’s just a tough situation, but it’s what we have to do. We’ve been telling the kids all year it’s about the next man up. Everybody has to be ready. “East Rutherford is explosive. They’ve got athletes that can hurt you if they get out into the open. Defensively, they’re aggressive and will bring pressure down on you. They like to mix it up with the different coverages they show you. They’re definitely a good, young football team.” Will Clark Crest High School (5-0, 2-0 SMAC) Last week: Beat R-S Central, 42-14 This Friday: hosts Chase “We got some stuff going early (against R-S Central). We talked about Tre (Harbison) running well out of the gate, and that’s what he did. It really loosened us up from there. When started choosing to play the run, we were able to get some option passing and some bubbles going, probably more than we have been. It was the fast start that we had been looking for and talking about all week. “With all the running around we do in games, our legs are tired. Playing two games in one week is going to hurt your legs. Obviously, we get less practice this week, but we have to just keep working hard. It’s a challenge, but it’s one I think we’ll be able to rise to and be prepared for on Friday. “I think Chase is definitely better than their 2-4 record. They’re going to run the ball right at you and fight really hard. Their defense does a good job getting to the ball and working hard.” Greg Lloyd Kings Mountain High School (5-1, 2-1 SMAC) Page 2 of 2 - Last week: Lost to Shelby, 34-20 This Friday: at Draughn “We were disappointed to lose the ball game (against Shelby), but by no means were we disappointed with the effort. We know we played an elite team, and it’s always helpful to play that high caliber of an opponent. Shelby is definitely the best team we’ve played so far. “I thought we executed quite well. We made a couple mistakes that cost us, but I think we’ll be able to regroup. The big thing for us moving forward is to find a way to win those kind of ball games and take that next step. I think this gives us confidence. We know we’re not that far off. “Draughn is 4-2, so you know they know how to win games. We’re just looking to bounce back and improve. If we can make plays, get some pressure and cut down on some of those mistakes, especially in the kicking game — just play good, sound football — I think we’ll be alright. We’re a little banged up, but it’s not awful. We still feel pretty good about where we are right now.” Lance Ware Shelby High School (6-0, 3-0 SMAC) Last week: Beat Kings Mountain, 34-20 This Friday: hosts East Burke “It was good to get a win against a good opponent (last week). Kings Mountain has a very good offense, and we were able to slow them down and set up good field position. Our defense has been getting better each week, and to see them come up big, along with the special teams, was very encouraging. “Our offensive line did a great job creating holes, which allowed for Xavier Brooks, Jwan Sims and Antwan Wright to all have big nights. We were able to make some first downs on the ground and keep moving the ball. I think for us to win a game like that in a different way than we have been says a lot about our football team. “East Burke is as much improved of a team as I have seen in a long time. They’re physical and can make things tough for you. From what I’ve heard, they’re running two platoons, and it’s made a big difference in how they’ve played. It will be another big test for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:10:41.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
