(Photo: Matthew OHaren, USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE This weekend finds NASCAR at a difficult crossroads – the second round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup ends at Talladega Superspeedway, one of motorsports’ most unpredictable and dangerous tracks.\nWith several drivers virtually in need of a win to avoid being one of four excused from the championship run and this season’s restrictor-plate races pockmarked by violence of a particularly wicked variety, Talladega opens its gates looking like a black monolith of a sort.\nAlthough both Daytona International Speedway and Talladega often produce spectacular multi-car wrecks - like the one at Daytona in July that saw Austin Dillon’s car sail into the catchfence on the final lap - most drivers say they usually run with more confidence at Talladega because the track is wider.\n“I’m sure we’re going to find a way to run into each other, for sure, but hopefully we all just -- it all stays on the ground,” Denny Hamlin said. “We’ll go out there and do what our job is to go out there and do.”\nUSA TODAY\nEven in second place, Denny Hamlin knows Chase spot isn't secure\nThe usual Talladega tension will be heightened, particularly if Chase contenders are bunched in the lead pack in the closing laps. Only Joey Logano - with wins at Charlotte and Kansas - is guaranteed a slot in the next round.\n“It’s going to be a crazy deal at the end,” said Martin Truex Jr., one of 11 drivers vying for the remaining seven slots. “We’re going to race hard and not worry about where we’re at throughout the day because we know how it can be there.\nUSA TODAY\nGluck: Like it or not, Talladega locked in as cutoff race\n“There are chances you have to be willing to take sometimes. Obviously, there’s a few guys that seem to be always able to make the right decision. A lot of it depends on what the guys around you do. You have to kind of go with your intuition on that and think, ‘What is this guy going to do? What is that guy going to do?’ ”\nChanges to help improve safety\nThe uniqueness of this stop on the Chase carousel – six races into the 10 that make up the title run – can be seen in official actions that came before teams roll into eastern Alabama.\nFirst, drivers will see a speedway racing corridor completely cloaked in SAFER barriers. Track officials say they have added 8,000 linear feet of the so-called “soft” walls, putting the barriers in front of every foot of outside and inside wall in the facility.\nUSA TODAY\nTexas Motor Speedway adding more SAFER barriers\nIn addition, NASCAR announced Tuesday a significant procedural change for its weekend races at the 2.66-mile, high-speed track. Although standard procedure calls for up to three green-white-checkered restarts to end a race if caution flags slow the field, this weekend’s races will be lengthened by only one attempt – if necessary.\nThe change is a nod toward safety – two-lap green-flag race-ending runs at Talladega and Daytona are filled with potential for mayhem. It’s an admission by NASCAR that repeated attempts at “GWC” finishes at the tracks often lead to huge crashes and increase the chances of drivers or fans being injured. Dillon and five fans in the frontstretch grandstand near where his car went into the catchfence suffered minor injuries.\n“We take very seriously the responsibility of balancing exciting finishes and safety,” said NASCAR executive vice president Steve O’Donnell. “We’re confident that this is a positive direction for both.”\nUSA TODAY\nNASCAR changes G-W-C rule for Talladega in interest of safety\nDrivers generally favor the change, although it’s curious that the sanctioning body, in citing safety, chose to leave one GWC finish in place.\nThe addition of SAFER barriers since the track’s May NASCAR weekend came against a background of anxiety.\nKyle Busch suffered a broken leg and foot in February when he crashed into a Daytona concrete wall not protected by a SAFER barrier. Then came Dillon’s crash, a dark accident that, at least in part, led to NASCAR’s decision to limit GWC finishes this week.\nNASCAR and speedway officials have been under pressure from drivers to accelerate installation of additional SAFER barriers, and Talladega track president Grant Lynch said he is confident his speedway has as much protection as any track.\n“There’s been a lot of talk about the slowness of getting this done,” Lynch told USA TODAY Sports. “When you put up as much as we’ve put up in the last six months, getting it fabricated is tough. Once you get into the turns, you have to fabricate the turn into the SAFER barrier. That’s really tricky because if you get the radius wrong, you can’t attach it to the wall. In turns one and two, we had to send some stuff back and have it bent more.\n“The track is dramatically different than it was in May, and May was better than it had been before.\"\nFollow Hembree on Twitter @mikehembree\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8fae520227546cb633d22e14e6dddcec042e6d4f/c=0-257-2544-1694&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810525741241884-USP-NASCAR--Duck-Commander-500.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed119fb3b521e5426cd24d9e947a640ca1f579fe/c=0-2615-3160-4400&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811379580391805-c01-dega-23.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811389539963648-USP-NASCAR--Windows-10-400-Qualifying.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LQ7q1F&text=%27Dega%3A%20%27Hopefully%20it%20all%20stays%20on%20the%20ground%27&via=usatoday", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4570732042001_video-still-for-video-4570541615001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4570732041001_thumbnail-for-video-4570541615001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LQ7q1F&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1LLXiXD", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dbd3916dcac9ede77aea5881cbe561bd08ca2059/c=0-197-2745-3857&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811389539963648-USP-NASCAR--Windows-10-400-Qualifying.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811389539963648-USP-NASCAR--Windows-10-400-Qualifying.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4570732042001_video-still-for-video-4570541615001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4addc9861a835048a7957e5e9ded2dde11533092/c=0-59-3019-1765&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809475714806095-USP-NASCAR--Coke-Zero-400-Powered-By-Coca-Cola.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b4188c67adf6f0a883ee0fff359676b830eb88de/c=551-0-2754-2203/local/-/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808645564326960-USATSI-8870850.jpg", "http://imgur.com/q4DRySy.png", "http://twitter.com/mikehembree", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4570732042001_video-still-for-video-4570541615001.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:56:07.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
