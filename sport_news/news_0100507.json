Addressing the media here today, the dera chief said he was not able to understand the reason behind the withdrawal of pardon granted to him. “I have always maintained that I respect all religions. I had signed the apology letter as per the text sent to me from Amritsar. It does not normally happen in matters of religion. Religion means one sticks to his stand. Perhaps, this is for the first time that this (withdrawal of Akal Takht edict) has happened,” said Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who returned to Sirsa yesterday from his tour abroad to promote his film “MSG-2”. He said he had signed his clarification in whatever form and language demanded from him. He said he had also sent a CD along with the letter. The dera chief said a majority of the people from the Sikh community as well as the intelligentsia had welcomed the Akal Takht’s move of granting him pardon on September 24 because they saw it a step that could restore peace in the region. “But what led them (Sikh clergy) to revoke their earlier order is beyond my comprehension,” he said. Asked whether it was due to some political pressure or the pressure from radical Sikh groups, he said it was for you (media) to decide. The dera chief: “I believe in spreading love and brotherhood. There is no change in my stand. All cases lodged against Sikhs in the wake of this controversy will be withdrawn by my followers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:24:37.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
