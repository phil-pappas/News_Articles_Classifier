Ryan Dzingel had three assists. \nAnd then there was Ottawa's last training camp cut, Matt Puempel, who had a goal and was reportedly playing well. \nBut when it came time to decide on a roster replacement for Mike Hoffman, the call went to McCormick, who had one goal and was a team worst minus-4. \nNumbers, you see, don't always tell the story. \nThe 23-year-old former sixth-round pick made his NHL debut Saturday night because, said Dave Cameron, the Senators had to stick to their words. \n\"There's a lot of debate that goes into it,\" Cameron said Saturday morning. \"You always look at the situation, but you call up the guy who's most deserving. Especially early in the year, because your about identity, you preach about working hard, you preach about doing the work so we'll consider you as a call up. And so you reward it. \n\"He was the best player down there, in our opinion.\" \nMcCormick learned of his promotion from B-Sens coach Luke Richardson Friday morning, when he showed up for practice. \n\"That was a pretty special moment,\" said McCormick. \"Something I've dreamt of for awhile. It was awesome.\" \nMcCormick said players in Bingo appreciate the fact call ups go to the most deserving. \n\"That's pretty special about the organization,\" he said. \"That's motivating for guys that might not think they're the frontrunner and the next call up, but if you're playing the best down there you're going to get a shot.\" \nCameron explained he started McCormick with Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Alex Chiasson because he's a \"pest\" and that's a pesky line. \nMcCormick showed up with a gash on his nose from his first fight up the season earlier this week, with St. John's Jeremy Gregoire. \n\"It was a good hit in our zone and one of their players didn't like it, so it ended up being a scrap,\" he said. \"That's sometimes what happens when you play like that.\" \nMcCormick's parents and sister flew in from the family home in Green Bay, WI. for the big night. At the morning skate, he said the butterflies in his stomach were starting to disappear. \n\"The closer I'm getting to the game I'm actually feeling more and more comfortable,\" he said. \"Yesterday I was pretty nervous. Like, is this really happening? It's just starting to sink in now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:36:06.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
