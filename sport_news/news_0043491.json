This is a life threatening condition if not treated on time. “Mr Sidhu has been put on blood thinners and has been recovering well. His condition is said to be stable as of now,” said a statement issued by Indraprastha Apollo Hospital authorities. DVT is caused by a blood clot in a deep vein which hinders the normal blood flow. The symptoms may include swelling, pain, and tenderness, often in the legs. Sidhu later tweeted saying, \"Down but Not Out! Life threatening disease (DVT) With God 's Grace will recover. Life is Fragile, handle with Prayer.\" Sidhu has been a two-time former MP from Amritsar constituency in Punjab. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:27:02.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
