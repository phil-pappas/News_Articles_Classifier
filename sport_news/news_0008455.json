RUSSO AP College Football Writer Baylor is No. 2 and Utah is up to fourth behind No. 1 Ohio State in The Associated Press college football poll. The Bears have their best ranking ever. They reached No. 3 three times previously, including once last season. Voters spread first-place votes around to six teams in the Top 25 released Sunday. The Buckeyes received 27, down 11 (38) from last week. Baylor has 13 and Utah has 16. No. 3 TCU received three first-place votes and No. 5 Clemson and No. 9 Texas A&M each received one. Ohio State started the season a unanimous No. 1, but as the Buckeyes have sputtered support has slipped. Ohio State pulled away from Maryland in the second half Saturday for a 49-28 victory. Now, there isn't much separation in the top four. The Buckeyes have 1,411 poll points, 21 more than Baylor. TCU is four points ahead of Utah.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:27:52.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
