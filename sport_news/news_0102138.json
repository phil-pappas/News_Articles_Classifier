All Trinity Christian head football coach Dan Matthews has to do is look at the Lions statistics through a 7-0 start. \nAnd it all starts at the top. \n“They score 39 [points] a game and they’re giving up 4 [per game],” Matthews said, nonchalantly this week. “They’re ranked fourth or fifth in the state for a reason. They’re a very solid football team. They’re well coached and they’re well disciplined.” \nIf last year’s 8-3 finish wasn’t proof that Loganville had made a successful transition from a former 8-man power in the ISCGA two years ago — making the same jump Trinity did after winning its own ISCGA championship in 2010 — than a 7-0 start has helped GISA opponents wise up. \nTonight at Trinity Christian is a chance for the two schools to battle over this year’s GISA Region 1-AAA crown. Loganville’s Lions need a win to clinch a title, while Trinity’s needs a victory and then a coinciding win next week at rival Heritage School to win its first ever GISA region football title. \nEither way, signs currently point for one of the two remaining 1-AAA unbeatens to be celebrating a milestone by Halloween night. \nBoth lineups enter tonight on the heels of win streaks. Along with Loganville’s perfect run, Trinity (6-2) has reeled off five consecutive victories while outscoring opponents 215-66. Last week’s 41-14 win at Bethlehem Christian was another confidence booster after finishing with a whopping 475 yards rushing as a team. \nLoganville, however, will be Trinity’s first opponent with a winning record since a 49-21 loss on Sept. 4 in a game this year while held to just 87 on 23 carries. \n“It’s a pro style offense. A lot of times they’ll put their fullback as another tight end,” Matthews said of Loganville. “They never have to change personnel but they can run 10 formations with the same personnel. They’re very multiple. They have good athletes and they’ve been running the same system.” \nAmong four receivers with at least nine catches, tight end Mike Meme (13 rec., 195 yds) may be the most dangerous, especially considering the 6-0, 180-pounder has seven of Loganville’s 21 sacks this year. \nThe defense has also combined for 16 fumble recoveries and 7 interceptions, with Trinity hoping to build on this year’s plus-11 turnover ratio tonight. \n“We’re going to have to execute. From what we’ve seen on film, we’re the only team that really does what we do on offense. We just have to play at a faster speed to what they’re used to seeing,” Matthews said. “Ever since the first game when we had five turnovers, we’ve been stressing ball security, ball security, ball security.” More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:12:56.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
