Sampling of NFL execs split on debate NESN 16 hrs ago Mike Cole © Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (12) warms up before the start of the game against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium. It’s one of the best debates in the NFL right now: Would you rather have Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers as your quarterback?\nAdChoices You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone to debate the assertion that Brady and Rodgers aren’t the two best quarterbacks in the NFL, but when you start talking about which one is the best, that’s where the debate really begins.\nThe case for each is obvious. Brady is one of the best winners the NFL has ever seen. Even at age 38, the New England Patriots quarterback continues to dazzle with his play and leadership. He’s always prepared and always has a plan when getting to the line of scrimmage. His accuracy on short to intermediate passes seems to get better with age, and his motivation is unquestioned, despite four Super Bowl wins.\nRodgers, meanwhile, is younger and more athletic. The Green Bay Packers quarterback has accuracy on seemingly every throw he has to make, and his ability to move inside and outside of the pocket makes him impossible to game-plan for. His arm is among the best in the league, too.\nThe clear answer, obviously, is that you’d be happy with either. SI.com asked three NFL executives which QB they’d pick to win one game. Brady edged Rodgers, two votes to one.\n“Even though Rodgers is the best, I’m going with the guy with four rings who just won,” an AFC general manager told SI.com.\n“A year ago, I would have probably picked Rodgers. But after what he did in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl against Seattle? Brady,” and NFC personnel director told the website.\nThe one exec taking Rodgers was an NFC general manager, who called Rodgers “unstoppable,” applauding him for his play despite injuries within the receiving corps.\n“Brady’s damn good, but Rodgers is in just another league right now,” he told SI.com.\nWith the way things are going through four weeks of the season, it won’t be entirely surprising to see this debate play out on the field — at the Super Bowl.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/08/nfl-week-5-blanket-coverage-tom-brady-aaron-rodgers", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:53:07.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
