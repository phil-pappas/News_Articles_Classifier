Sure, Tom Brady, we believe you. \n\"I really don't see it any different than each of the other games we've played,\" Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels parroted during the practice week leading up to New England's showdown tonight with the Colts in Indianapolis. \nComplaints lodged by the Colts in the first half of New England's AFC Championship game 45-7 rout last season triggered a long-running soap opera about air pressure in footballs. The issue, despite the endless off-season turmoil, remains unresolved with another court date looming. \nHad NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's four-game suspension of Brady for his alleged role in Deflategate not been overturned by Judge Richard Berman, this game against the Colts would have been his season debut. It's unlikely the Patriots would have had the same 4-0 start with Jimmy Garoppolo at quarterback. \nBRIEF: Ego Ferguson (knee) became the second defensive lineman to be placed on injured reserve by the Chicago Bears this season when he was shut down for the remainder of the year Saturday. Taking Ferguson's place on the roster is Bruce Gaston, a Chicago native who played at Purdue and was signed off the practice squad of the Green Bay Packers.
