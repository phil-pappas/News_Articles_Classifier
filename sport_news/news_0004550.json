(AP) — The Seattle Seahawks on Tuesday activated fullback Derrick Coleman following his suspension after a car crash that led to his arrest and re-signed center Lemuel Jeanpierre. \nSeattle coach Pete Carroll had announced the team’s intention of reinstating Coleman on Monday. Coleman was arrested for investigation of vehicular assault and hit-and-run last week, but no charges have been filed. \nJeanpierre was signed because of concerns over the health of Patrick Lewis, who suffered ankle and knee injuries making his first start of the season at center last Sunday against Carolina. Jeanpierre made three starts last season at center for Seattle. \nThe Seahawks waived cornerback Crezdon Butler and placed linebacker Brock Coyle on injured reserve/designated for return due to a knee injury. Coyle could return in Week 15 against Cleveland. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:35:15.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
