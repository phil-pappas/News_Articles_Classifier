After borrowing other people’s rackets for so long, I bought a Yonex . It’s really light and quite strong. I have very little competitive edge when it comes to athletics. If we lose or win, it really doesn’t matter to me.\nWhen I travel, I use my iPhone almost exclusively as a camera. It fills up so quickly that I bring along a SanDisk Connect Wireless Flash Drive , which lets me transfer photos and free up space. You can put movies on it, too, and stream them to your iPhone or iPad. Now I have all these movies when I travel.\nMy Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones are great for travel, but I enjoy them just as much in the workplace. Because they’re big and cover my ears, it’s one of those respected silent cues that we have in the office. When I’m wearing them, people give me space to do what I need to do.\nThe number-one thing that Lego designers have to have on their desks is a Lego Brick Separator , which we include with most of our larger sets. It can disconnect almost any of the pieces. The new one has a flat edge to lift up tiles, a cross axel to remove Technic connectors and a better way to remove jumper plates.\nI’m amazed that the Saturday Night Live app has thousands of skits from the program. If I’m homesick, I’ll watch an old Chris Farley skit or another one that I grew up with.\nIf I’m in a hotel or visiting somebody and I get on Wi-Fi, I use the Speedtest app to see how fast the connection is. At home, I’m at 45 megabits per second downstream, but at my dad or my mom’s, it’s not uncommon for it to be 10. I just like to know how ambitious I can be.\nI always enjoyed listening to National Public Radio, but when I moved to Denmark obviously it wasn’t broadcast here. So I went looking for podcasts of public-radio shows, like Radiolab and Marketplace . It’s been a way to feel connected with the world outside of Denmark and to know what my family and people back home are talking about.\nWhen I go back to the U.S., I put a local, prepaid T-Mobile SIM card into my iPhone. I can keep the same phone number as long as I use the card within a year and recharge it. That way, whenever I go back, everybody knows my number.\n—Edited from an interview by Chris Kornelis\nMore in Tech Essentials Winemaker Mari Wells Coyle Tony Hawk Stunt Driver Debbie Evans Author Chuck Palahniuk Cartoonist Scott McCloud", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:09:04.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
