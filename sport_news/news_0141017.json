Nationals ace Scherzer pitching no-hitter thru 8 vs Mets 1  /  2 Back to Gallery NEW YORK (AP) â€” Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer is pitching a no-hitter through eight innings against the New York Mets .\nScherzer already has thrown a no-hitter this season, in June against Pittsburgh.\nThe NL East champion Mets haven't come close to a hit off Scherzer. He has struck out his last seven batters and 15 overall without a walk.\nThe Mets' only runner reached on a throwing error by third baseman Yunel Escobar on Kevin Plawecki 's leadoff grounder in the sixth.\nScherzer has thrown 93 pitches on a brisk, blustery night at Citi Field in the second game of a day-night doubleheader. Washington leads 2-0.\nThis was the fifth time this season that Scherzer took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning. The 2013 AL Cy Young winner with Detroit is in his first year with the Nationals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T04:48:11.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
