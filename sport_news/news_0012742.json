Of course, that didn’t end so well the last time.\n“I remember the Endy catch,” David Wright said with a smile.\nThe rest of it — the Yadier Molina home run, the Adam Wainwright curveball, the inescapable gloom that descended upon Shea Stadium on Oct. 19, 2006, as the Cardinals celebrated that forever 3-1 victory in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series — only exists as a blur.\nAnd as a reminder of just how fickle these games can be.\n“Obviously, we would’ve liked to get this done here, at home, when we had a game advantage,” Wright said, maybe a half-hour after the Mets had fallen 3-1 to the Dodgers in Game 4 of the NL Division Series, setting up a decisive, do-or-die Game 5 Thursday in Los Angeles.\n“But this is the advantage when you win Game 3 like we did. We had two cracks at it. Their backs were to the wall and now ours are right there with them.”\nIf the Mets are going to preserve their record of never losing a best-of-five series in their history (they are 5-for-5, starting with the 1969 NLCS) then they are going to have to go against their less-certain history in winner-take-alls.\nThey have played one Game 5 (the ’73 NLCS, versus Cincinnati) and won it; they have played four Game 7s and lost three of them (the ’86 World Series the only one on the left side of the hyphen, the ’73 World Series, ’88 NLCS and ’06 NLCS on the right side). They also won the only play-in game they have ever contested, for the 1999 wild card against the Reds.\n“In a lot of ways, you practice playing a Game 5 or a Game 7 the whole time you’re in the playoffs because you know that a game can swing on one pitch, one at-bat, one bounce of the ball,” Wright said. “If that’s your mindset anyway then playing a game like that shouldn’t be all that different. You already know the stakes you’re playing for.”\nThe Mets should still be a confident lot Thursday night because they will be fortified with the knowledge their best pitcher will be going on full rest. Mets manager Terry Collins still may be reluctant to bestow the title of “ace” on Jacob deGrom — whether it’s out of muscle memory or a he-was-first loyalty, he still uses that term to refer to Matt Harvey — but there is little doubt whom the Mets would rather have on the mound for Game 5.\nDeGrom was brilliant in Game 1 — 13 strikeouts and zero runs in seven innings, with only a small handful of balls hit reasonably hard. Because the Dodgers will counter with the presumptive Cy Young award winner in Zack Greinke, it’s imperative for the Mets to keep the Dodgers off the scoreboard, too. DeGrom figures to do that.\n“Look, there’s a reason why we thought, ‘Hey, look, if we’re up 2-1 in Game 4, we’re going to save [deGrom] because he’s the guy we want on the mound,’ ” Collins said. “I mean, we’ll have a whole host of guys in the bullpen behind him. But you know, he’s had regular rest, so that’s a good sign. That’s good for him.\n“And you kind of feel real confident that he’s pitched well out there, that he’s going to go out and do it again. And this is a time when you need your guys to step up and you certainly think he’ll do that.”\nThey all need to be sharp. They all need to forget, forever, that there’s a good chance this series would already be over if the umpiring crew had correctly ruled a double play on Chase Utley’s controversial takeout slide in Game 2. And they need to forget how Kershaw suffocated them in Game 4, with Citi Field ready to accept any sign as a go-ahead to ring in a loud celebration. Kershaw never gave them the chance.\n“He was a beast tonight,” Wright said.\nAnd now the task ahead is a beast, a one-and-done, a do-or-die, one game to buy a little extra baseball for themselves, to be the foil to the terrific baseball story being penned at Wrigley Field. One game for the whole season. And maybe that’s exactly as it should be, given the season in question.\n david wright , jacob degrom , new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:19:17.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
