It was back in 1985 when the Detroit Red Wings were looking for a voice to replace future NHL Hall of Famer Bruce Martyn on television broadcasts.\nFront office executive Jim Lites reached down to the farm and elevated Strader from Adirondack of the American Hockey League.\nStrader proved worthy. He thrived for more than a decade in the place where the term \"Hockeytown\" was trademarked. In 1996, ESPN came calling, dangling a national gig as its No. 2 play-by-play voice behind Gary Thorne.\nNow Lites, the Stars president, has called upon Strader, late of NBC and NBC Sports Network, to replace Ralph Strangis in Dallas. Strangis spent 22 seasons broadcasting the team's games, the last 19 from the simulcast play-by-play seat. Over the years Strangis and his partner Daryl Reaugh built a Stars brand as beloved as any this side of Mike Modano.\nStrader, who did time between ESPN and NBC with the Florida Panthers and Arizona Coyotes, understands the circumstance.\n\"For what he established, Ralph will forever be part of the history of the team,\" Strader said. \"For what he established, I am coming into a great situation.\"\nWhen the puck drops to open the Stars season Thursday night against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Strader will become the third fulltime television and radio voice in team history. He hopes to become more than the answer to a trivia question as Mike Fornes has.\nAt 60, Strader believes this is the last stop on the path that began when he was 23 and had never even seen a hockey game in person.\nThat's when he hooked on with the Adirondack Red Wings in his hometown of Glen Falls, N.Y. He had signed on to be an assistant public relations manager in 1978, a year before the team debuted on ice.\nWhen the players finally arrived, Strader, who called basketball back in college at the University of Massachusetts, took a tape recorder to training camp and patched together some audition tapes. They were good enough to win him a seat behind a microphone.\n\"I think that most of all they liked the fact that for $11,000 a year their public relations assistant could also broadcast the games,\" he said.\nStrader might have been a lifer with the Red Wings organization had ESPN not asked him to be its No. 3 play-by-play voice in 1996. The plan was to stay with the Red Wings and fill in at ESPN. But when No. 2 Tom Mees drowned two months before the start of the season, he was asked to move up. That meant fulltime national work and the need to break with the Red Wings.\nAt NBC, Strader worked behind Mike Emrick, the dean of hockey broadcasters. He started in 2011. But by the end of last season, Strader believed he would be dropped to third in the rotation behind Kenny Albert.\nStrader met with Lites about the Stars job in May, about a month after Strangis split to embrace new challenges. It didn't take long for the old boss to rehire his old broadcaster.\n\"This is a wonderful opportunity,\" Strader said. \"I can't wait for the season to start. It's going to be great.\"\nRalph: Here, there, everywhere It would not be hyperbole to say that Ralph Strangis has discovered a new world since parting ways with the Stars in April. After 25 seasons in the team's broadcast booth - 22 in Dallas -- Strangis, 54, has been getting around. He spent a month alongside California's Venice Beach working on a novel \"about a guy who has decided to leave his old life behind.\" Lest you think it is autobiographical, Strangis' plot includes aliens visiting from outer space. He plans on returning to Venice Beach for at least another month to continue writing, \"It's evolving,\" he said. He also bought a Jeep and spent two weeks touring the Southwest. Among the states visited were New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada. Then there was his just-ended trip to France where he spent five days familiarizing himself with Paris before joining his father for a bicycling trip through the Burgundy wine region.\nIn the works is a trip to Colombia where he is scheduled to live in a convent and work with orphaned children.\n\"Sounds like something interesting to do,\" said the divorced father of a daughter who is a college freshman.\nHis base of operations is a one-bedroom apartment in Uptown.\nIn between trips, Strangis has written about hockey for NHL.com and about life for The Dallas Morning News' Points section.\nHe's also done about half a dozen public speaking engagements. On his docket is a scheduled talk to an assembly of doctors at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum. The topic is \"If you don't like your world do something about it.\"\nBut the broadcasting bug is not completely gone. He concedes he has some discussions about returning to the business albeit mostly on a part-time basis. But he is letting his agent handle that aspect of his life. He is in no rush to jump into anything, Strangis this week, two days after returning from France. \"I'm cool to do just what I am doing,\" he said.\nSunday Night Football NBC's Sunday Night Football, which next features the Cowboys-New Orleans Saints, has been television's most-watched prime time show for four consecutive seasons. Now it's off to its best start in its 10 seasons on the air. It wouldn't be a stretch to say it is well on it's way to a five-peat.\nHere for your viewing pleasure is the rundown of shows that have ranked No. 1 for at least four television seasons since 1950.\n(Note: \"Dallas\" isn't one of them. It ranked No. 1 only three seasons).\nNBC's Sunday Night Football (4 seasons): 2011-2012 through 2014-2015\nCBS' Gunsmoke (4 season): 1957-58 through 1960-61.\nNBC's The Cosby Show: 1985-86 through 1989-90*\nCBS' All in the Family: 1971-72 through 1975-76\nFox's American Idol (6 seasons): 2005-06 through 2010-11.\n* Tied with Cheers, also on NBC, in 1989-90\nTalkin' Rangers The Rangers playoff-clinching win over the Angels on Thursday night scored season-high 6.4 in the ratings for Fox Sports Southwest. The game peaked in its final 15 minutes at 8.7. Still, the Rangers 6.4 finished second to the 9.1 posted by the Ravens-Steelers NFL game on KTVT (Channel 11).\nThe Rangers-Angels go national Saturday at noon when Matt Vasgersian, John Smoltz and Jon Paul Morosi call the Fox game on KDFW (Channel 4). Sunday's 2 p.m. start will be on TBS and FSSW. Ernie Johnson Jr., Cal Ripken Jr. and Ron Darling call the TBS game. FSSW's Steve Busby and Tom Grieve sign off for the season at game's end.\nReminder: The AL wild card game belongs to ESPN. The ALDS and ALCS belong to Fox, which will keep some games and send others to cable's Fox Sports 1 and MLB Network. Radio voices Eric Nadel and Matt Hicks will call the Ramgers post-season on The Fan. All National League post-season series will be on TBS.\nRadio daze The numbers are in for Nielsen's latest sports talk ratings period, known as the \"September Book,\" even if it covers only Aug. 13 to Sept. 9.\nThe race in the all-important category of men 25-54 finished: 4.7 for Sportsradio 1310 and 96.7 FM The Ticket; 4.5 for 105.3 The Fan; and 2.0 for KESN-FM (103.3).\nOn a more intimate level, men 25-54 from Monday to Friday 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. when the big-name, high-priced local talent is on the air, it was: Ticket 5.8; Fan 4.2; KESN 2.2.\nWhen it comes to individual shows, The Ticket's Morning Musers remain head and shoulders above a crowded pack.

Closest were the station's Hardline and the Fan's Ben & Skin, both at 5.0.\nTalk notes:\nThe Ticket will have to wait to earn its third National Association of Broadcasters' Marconi Award as \"Sports Station of the Year.\" New York's WFAN won the award Thursday night in Atlanta...KESN's Cowlishaw & Mosley show celebrates its second anniversary next week...The ratings include only the debut week of Donovan Lewis' pairing with Norm Hitzges...Not a single Cowboys regular-season game, a big boost for the Fan, is included in the month.
