That matters appears to have been resolved. \nHeyward spoke with the league and the two sides agreed that the defensive end will honor his father in different ways moving forward, while the league agreed to reduce his fine , according to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler. \nHeyward had “Iron Head” written on his eye black for a game a few weeks ago and was fined by the NFL $5,787 . Despite the fine, Heyward did the same thing in Week 6 . Heyward’s father, former NFL running back/fullback Craig “Iron Head” Heyward, died from cancer in 2006, leading his son to issue the tribute. \nOn Tuesday, Heyward tweeted about the matter and said he would no longer wear the eye black: Here's an update on my EyeBlack pic.twitter.com/miFUzcO8Cj \n— Cam Heyward (@CamHeyward) October 21, 2015 \nHeyward was facing an $11,576 fine for the second offense. \nApparently what helped Heyward’s case is that former Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman Devon Still was not fined for writing a tribute to his daughter, who has been battling cancer , on his eye black. Heyward has agreed to honor his father in other ways moving forward.
