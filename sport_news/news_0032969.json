Madison made history last season, handing perennial powerhouse Midwood its first division loss in 15 years in May.\nNow, the Lady Knights are chasing history once again. Midwood has claimed 15 straight division crowns, but is currently sitting in third place in Brooklyn A-III with a 5-2-2 record.\nThat's opened the door for Madison to emerge as a threat to snap the Hornets' streak. The Knights (8-1) are currently in second place in the division, just behind Brooklyn Tech (8-0).\nMadison could take over first place if it defeats the Engineers at home this afternoon (4 p.m.). Topping the Engineers will be no easy task, though. Tech handed Madison its lone loss of the season, a 5-1 setback on April 7.\n\"They're a tough team,\" goalkeeper Jamecia Forsythe said of the Engineers. \"I hope we can get ourselves together.\"\nForsythe's play will be key if Madison hopes to upend Tech. The Engineers' dangerous offense averages 5.3 goals per game, and they scored three first-half goals against Forsythe on April 7.\nBut the junior goalie has improved since then, surrendering less than a goal per game during the Knights' recent five-game winning streak.\nShe's gotten plenty of help, though. Madison's practice shirts say \"one team, one effort, one goal\" and the team has embraced that slogan, playing a team-oriented game instead of one-on-one soccer.\n\"It's not about star players at all,\" said senior midfielder Margaret Taormina . \"It's going to come down to teamwork; it's not about one person having a good game, it's about all of us working together.\"\nFreshman midfielder Ysamar Moran (four goals, six assists) excels at controlling the ball. Akeylah Patrick and Aleksandra Pinkhasova lead the team with seven goals apiece.\nIt's the same balanced attack that helped the Knights defeat Midwood, 1-0, in last year's season finale, and the same approach that the team used to upend Midwood, 3-0, on April 23.\nThe latest victory, according to Forsythe, confirmed that the Knights are now one of the PSAL's top teams, just one year after finishing 5-6-1.\n\"After we beat them, that's what teams saw,\" Forsythe said of last year's statement win. \"That we were a force to be reckoned with.\"\nThe Knights want that division title as further validation, but they know there are still plenty of challenges ahead. In addition to today's Brooklyn Tech showdown, Madison faces fiesty Fort Hamilton on Thursday, then closes the regular season against Midwood in the \"Battle of Bedford Avenue\" next Tuesday in a game that very well could decide the division crown.\nBut while the Knights are focused on taking the division, 13th-year Madison coach Nick Punzone is barely thinking about that. He's already proud of what his gritty, team-oriented squad has accomplished this spring.\n\"I feel we've taken the next step,\" said Punzone, whose team will make its third straight playoff appearance. \"I think we're starting to see some of the success of our hard work. If it's meant to be, then we'll beat Tech.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:54:38.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
