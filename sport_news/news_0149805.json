In the first game of Hi-Lo League play, Trona took down the Lone Pine Eagles 38-13 Friday night. The Tornadoes improved their record to 4-1 overall with the win. “I loved it,” said Trona head coach Curtis Boutte. “That’s what league play is all about: good, hard-fought football.” Trona scored first, when quarterback Tyler Boutte threw a strike to Walter Terry to make it 6-0. Lone Pine answered back with a scoring pass, then connected an extra point to take the one-point lead, 7-6. With 2:43 left in the second stanza, Tyler Boutte lobbed a pass in the direction of Gunnar Cartmell that was tipped by a Lone Pine defender and then caught by Cartmell in the end zone. After a successful two-point conversion, Trona led by a touchdown, 14-7. With 50 seconds to go in the half, Lone Pine scored, but failed the extra-point attempt to remain down by one. But the Tornadoes used the most of its final drive in the half, as Terry grabbed another scoring pass with 11.4 seconds left. Another two-point conversion made it 22-13 at the half. The second half was all Trona. The Tornadoes added two touchdowns -- one in each quarter -- in the second half to increase their lead. “The bye week did slow us down a little bit,” Curtis Boutte said. “But once the flow started, we woke up and started playing.” Trona will next host Immanuel Christian in its Homecoming game on Oct. 10. Kickoff is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. By Christopher Livingston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:59:42.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
