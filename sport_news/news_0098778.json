And they nearly crashed and burned Saturday in the early going.\nBut the No. 5-ranked Denver Pioneers hockey team started flying in the second period Saturday.\nNolan Zajac slipped out of the penalty box and into a jet stream up the ice for the deciding goal, lifting Denver from its grounding as the Pioneers defeated Air Force 3-1 at half-full Magness Arena.\nZajac's goal was a burst of team speed. With less than three minutes remaining in the second period, defenseman Blake Hillman cleared a long pass up the middle of the ice to Zajac, who sprinted out of the box.\nHe split two Falcons defenders for a one-on-one with goaltender Billy Christopoulos. Zajac's wrister missed, but suddenly, DU's entire side was at the net.\n\"That was a smart-looking play, to snap a pass out 70-80 feet for a breakaway,\" Denver coach Jim Montgomery said.\nEvan Janssen's rebound try in front of the net was turned away as Christopoulos dived to his right. But with the goaltender recovering, DU's Logan O'Connor cycled the puck back to Zajac on the backside for an easy goal.\nIn a flash, Denver erased a season-opening disappointment.\nThe Pioneers, whose postseason run put them in the Elite Eight last season, opened this season with an air of hype.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:26:47.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
