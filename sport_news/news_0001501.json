It was the most stunning ending to a college football game since Auburn's \"Kick-Six\" in 2013 , and we may not see anything like it for a while. \nOf course, that wasn't all that happened in Week 7. Memphis made its case as a playoff dark horse, and Alabama and Baylor grabbed statement wins against conference opponents. We had fat-guy two-point conversions and flying quarterbacks. \nAll in all, it was a busy day. \nWho were the winners and losers from Week 7? We break down all that was good, bad, ugly, gorgeous and more in the following slides. \n\nAs a reminder, Winners and Losers is live while evening games are still being played. Fear not, as we will update this post throughout the night as events warrant. Tweet \nIf we took the time, we could probably parse through all the things that were great and not so great between Michigan and Michigan State. \nFor example: Michigan defensive back/do-it-all weapon Jabrill Peppers? He was a total playmaker, doing things in all three phases of the game. \nThe officials, who wrongly ejected Wolverines linebacker Joe Bolden for a targeting foul that never actually occurred, and who gave Michigan a controversial touchdown at the goal line? Horrific. \nAll of those things will likely be forgotten, however. They pale in comparison to college football's most miraculous, stunning and heartbreaking loss since Auburn's \"Kick-Six\" in 2013. With just seconds remaining and leading 23-21, Michigan snapped the ball to punt to the Spartans. \nIf everything had gone smoothly, the punt would have taken enough time off the clock to end the game. Or, at the very least, Michigan State would have had time for one more play but faced nearly impossible odds on a Hail Mary. \nInstead, Michigan's punter fumbled the snap, and Michigan State immediately scooped it up for the game-winning score and the 27-23 victory. \nThe 2015 college football season has been eventful, but you will not find an ending to a game this year that will render more people speechless like this one. \nThere are no words, just the screams of joy mixed with screams of horror and a need to watch what happened over and over again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:10:06.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
