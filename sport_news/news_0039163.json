Lynch was technically active for that game, but did not play after suffering back spasms in pregame warm-ups.\nLinebacker Bruce Irvin, who had been listed as questionable after being added to the injury report with an ankle injury after Sunday's walkthrough practice, is active.\nMebane missed seven regular season games in 2014 with a hamstring injury that landed him on injured reserve. He'll be replaced in the starting lineup by third-year player Jordan Hill.\nAlso inactive for the Seahawks are free safety Steven Terrell (hip flexor), cornerback Tharold Simon (toe), linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis (hamstring), offensive lineman Kristjan Sokoli and defensive end Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder).\nLinebacker DeAndre Levy -- a second-team AP All-Pro in 2014 -- will not make his 2015 debut for the Lions as he continues to deal with a hip injury.\nAlso out for Detroit are starting running back Joique Bell, starting right guard Larry Warford, defensive end Phillip Hunt, tackle Corey Robinson, tight end Brandon Pettigrew and defensive tackle Jermelle Cudjo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:15:11.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
