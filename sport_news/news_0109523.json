Love, Andy.\"\nHe then delivered the opposing coach another bouquet with a different note: \"Go Cougars! Love, Dad.\"\nThose flowers belonged to Drewann Pancratz, the youngest of Andy and Jeanette's four children and the second-year volleyball coach at Conant.\n\"Go get 'em!\" Andy Pancratz said to his wife and daughter. \"Somebody win!\"\nSchaumburg and Conant have been rivals for decades. The schools are three miles apart, and Jeanette Pancratz and former Conant coach Peg Scholten are among the top 20 in career wins among Illinois girls volleyball coaches.\nWhen Scholten retired in 2013, Drewann Pancratz was the girls basketball coach at Leyden and had no intentions of returning to the Mid-Suburban League roots that define the Pancratz family. Andy was the first All-State basketball player at Hersey, then suited up for DePaul, where Jeanette played volleyball. Drewann's three older brothers were standout basketball players at Schaumburg. Drewann completed her student teaching at Fremd and is the all-time assists leader for her mother's program at Schaumburg and at Carthage College, where she also played basketball.\nPrep football Week 5 notes: Conant keeps its options open to beat Fremd Mike Helfgot Conant adopted the spread offense in 2008 because the triple option no longer suited its personnel.\nBill Modelski planned to adapt to his roster again this fall, but the Conant coach kept it under his hat, safely tucked away during the Cougars' 4-0 start.\nIn the first of consecutive games against...\nConant adopted the spread offense in 2008 because the triple option no longer suited its personnel.\nBill Modelski planned to adapt to his roster again this fall, but the Conant coach kept it under his hat, safely tucked away during the Cougars' 4-0 start.\nIn the first of consecutive games against...\n(Mike Helfgot) Drewann said she didn't know about the opening at Conant until late in the hiring process, though Jeanette insists there might have been cosmic intervention.\n\"It was almost destiny that she's here,\" Jeanette Pancratz said, \"because my first year at Schaumburg, I was expecting her.\n\"She was destined to be an MSL person for the rest of her life.\"\nDrewann's coaching style is similar to Jeanette's after two decades living in the same home and four years as a player-coach tandem.\nBut they have their differences.\nDuring timeouts, Jeanette lets her players lead the discussion, while Drewann uses the full minute for instruction. During game play, Jeanette holds her clipboard in her crossed arms, showing little emotion. Drewann is a flurry of activity, bending at the knees as if trying to dig a spike or leaning back as if letting an opponent's errant serve sail out of play.\nAn hour before the match, mother and daughter were all smiles, one looking away to fight off tears as the other described their bond. They tranistioned into coach mode by the time of their curt pre-match handshake, one that was repeated after the match, showing the competitive streak that defines their family.\nPrep football: Mike Helfgot's Week 6 Top 20 Mike Helfgot 1.

She has 798 career wins in 35 years of coaching. Drewann has 20 wins at Conant. They meet again Oct. 1 in Schaumburg.\nDrewann is the newest branch of the Jeanette Pancratz coaching tree. Her former players have gone on to coach at Prospect, Hoffman Estates, Willowbrook, St. Charles North and many others.\n\"When a student-athlete goes into the field, that excites me because it's somebody who really enjoyed their experiences,\" Jeanette said. \"We both coach with a style that's about developing the whole person, which translates to success on the court as well.\"\nmstainbrook@tribpub.com\nTwitter: @Stainbrook419\n Sports High School Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560717be/turbine/ct-spt-0929-prep-fb-week-6-top-20-rankings-20150928", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5608b2fc/turbine/ct-spt-0920-prep-vb-pancratz-mother-daughter-20150914", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56071908/turbine/ct-spt-0927-prep-fb-bits-20150926"], "published": "2015-09-27T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:59:34.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
