There’s only Steve and the board of directors can answer that. \n“It’s quite difficult to guess or estimate what impact it will have on the club. \n“I think Steve will continue to be supportive, he will want the best for the club, I do feel that. \n“People’s perception of the board’s position, people looking into it, it could go this way or that way. It’s very difficult for me to speak for Steve Morgan. \n“There are, obviously, with him putting the club up for sale, a lot of imponderables, it would be unfair of me not to say that. Exactly where all the answers are, here and now, are certainly impossible to answer.” Jackett spoke to his players as a group, and then individually with captain Danny Batth, on Tuesday to outline how he views the situation and what it means for the players. \nThe Wolves boss said Morgan had been ‘very good’ to work for. “He’s been good to me,” Jackett added. \nWill Jackett though seek clarification in terms of planning for new players?

If players come into the team and do it internally that is always the best thing, and you shouldn’t necessarily pass that up.
