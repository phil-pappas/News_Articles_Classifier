It’ll be a long trip to the continent down under, but Petersburg native Roland Parsons, 64, is all set for the Duathlon 2015 ITU World Championships, to be held in Adelaide starting Oct. 14. The 55-kilometer race consists of three back-to-back legs: a 10 kilometer run, 40 kilometers of cycling and a 5 kilometer run. Parsons ran track at Petersburg High School in 1966 and 1967. He competed in his first run-bike event in 1984 at Suffolk. He has raced in events spanning the nation from Virginia to Columbus, Ga., where he finished second overall, to the Duathlon National Championships in Saint Paul, Minn., and Tucson, Ariz. On the biking side, Parsons pointed to his enjoyment of the gadgets that go along with the bicycle, such as the GPS devices that enable him to see the maps and elevations of the courses and navigate back to the course if he gets lost. Parsons faces his strongest competition at the regional and national events. He and fellow competitors have been racing around and against one another since the 1980s. He noted that some of the athletes who would beat him then are still fit today. He described a gentleman, Joe Carr, in his 70s who has competed in the worlds several times. “I was in the race where [he ran] his first run-bike event, because he was a super runner, but he wasn’t much of a biker back then,” Parsons said before adding with a laugh, “I was able to beat him in that one, but it wasn’t long after that he was finishing ahead of me. “I caught up with him again because he’s in the over 70 group and his running has suffered a lot, but his cycling is still up there,” Parsons said. “The age doesn’t seem to affect the cycling as much as it does the running.\" Parsons recognized some of the names of fellow athletes — about eight or nine, including Carr — who have signed up to go to Australia. When asked what he was looking forward to the most about his trip to Adelaide, Parsons said with a chuckle, “Surviving.” “One part of the trip is like 15 and a half hours in the airplane,” Parsons said. “That’ll probably be the hardest part of the trip.” In preparing for the events, Parsons generally trains in the Petersburg area, including Petersburg National Battlefield Park. He has also done the moonlight ride in the City of Richmond as well as the Martin’s Tour of Richmond — a Gran Fondo cycling event that is put on by Sports Backers. The Duathlon ITU World Championships will be held Oct. 14 - Oct. 18.
