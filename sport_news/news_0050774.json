This was revealed in a report issued in connection with a non-government organisation (NGO) case. The ban was lifted on the Jamaat-ud-Dawa and two other organisations a week ago. The Alkhter Trust and Al-Rashid Trust are the other two organisations from whom the ban has been lifted, the Daily Times reports. The report has suggested that 53 NGOs, including US-based Save the Children Bahwalnagar have been declared controversial. The Punjab Government had appealed to the federal government to resolve the issue of registration of seminaries. A committee constituted by the Federal government has stopped the matter of seminaries so far, the daily national reported. Hafiz Saeed is the mastermind of the Mumbai attack, which killed over 200 people. India has been demanding Pakistan to take stringent action against Saeed and his organistion JuD. However, no such action has been taken by the Pakistani government. — ANI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:02:09.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
