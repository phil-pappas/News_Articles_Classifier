Three of Skwarlo’s five touchdowns were for 50 or more yards, including a 58-yard score just four plays into the game. Skarlow said he hadn’t scored that many times in a game since youth football. \n“Our linemen came off the ball hard and made some good blocks,” Skarlow said. “We really wanted to establish the run, and that’s exactly what we did.” \nThe Junior Blues (5-2) struggled to get any offensive momentum going in the first half, recording only 37 yards of total offense, including an 11-yard run from junior Hunter Browning on the half’s final play. Browning came on late in the second quarter when senior starting running back Matthew Williams left the game with an apparent right leg injury. \nRural totaled 83 yards on the ground, including 38 on six attempts from junior Ben Harrison. Rural was forced to punt eight times, while picking up only six first downs. \n“Their defense is extremely physical and very fast,” Rural coach Steve Buhler said. “Them controlling the ball on the ground, and us getting behind seven, then 14 points, you can’t start chucking the ball all game.” \nThe two quarterbacks combined for only six completions on 19 pass attempts. Rural’s lone score came on its second-to-last drive, when senior Mitchell Schurig connected with senior Jovon Hall for a 21-yard touchdown in the corner of the end zone. \nSchurig was 4 for 12 for 37 yards with one touchdown and an interception at the end of the third quarter that put the Firebirds only 31 yards away from their fifth touchdown of the night. \n“Field position became a problem,” Buhler said. “We did not help our defense any with the way our offense sputtered around with things.” \nRural will take on Topeka High on Oct. 23 at home as the Junior Blues look for their sixth win of the season. Topeka High remained undefeated with a 41-14 win over Manhattan on Friday night. \nFree State (4-3) 7 21 0 7 — 35 \nWashburn Rural (5-2) 0 0 0 7 — 7 \nFree State — Skwarlo 58 run (Lake kick) \nFree State — Skwarlo 55 run (Lake kick) \nFree State — Skwarlo 54 run (Lake kick) \nFree State — Skwarlo 2 run (Lake kick) \nFree State — Skwarlo 10 run (Lake Kick) \nWashburn Rural — Hall 21 pass from Mit.
