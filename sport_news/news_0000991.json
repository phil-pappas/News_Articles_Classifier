Footage and photographs circulated on social media showing chairs being thrown. Trouble also seemed to have spread to nearby Exchange Square. \nA tweet from Greater Manchester Police revealed the three people arrested were Polish. \nThe tweet read: \"3 x Polish Football fans arrested for a violent disorder following the incident at Shambles Square earlier this evening.\" \nA statement added: \"Three men have been arrested following a fight on Exchange Square. \n\"Shortly before 3.30pm on Wednesday 21 October, 2015, police received a report of a fight on Exchange Square involving a group of football fans. \n\"Officers quickly attended the scene and the group dispersed. \n\"Three men were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. They have been taken into police custody. \n\"A man was treated at the scene by paramedics for a head injury. \n\"Police officers remain on patrol in the city centre this evening.\" \nThe trouble is not believed to be linked to the City-Sevilla match. \nThere were suggestions some of the people involved were wearing the colours of Polish club Slask Vroclaw, whose fans have clashed with those of Sevilla previously.
