But it is always better to be safe than sorry. \n“This fixture is known to get quite heated, so we are very thankful for the police presence,” he told Malay Mail yesterday. \nOn Friday, Ipoh police chief Asst Comm Sum Chang Keong said police would be on full alert after receiving information there could be trouble brewing. \nSum said drums, gongs, and prohibited items like weapons and flares would not be allowed in the stadium. \nHe said police would conduct thorough checks at all gates. \nHe added police would also monitor buses carrying JDT supporters, after objects were hurled at the vehicles in previous matches in Perak. \nPerak Die Hard Fanz club president Roslan Mat Baharom said he was disappointed with the decision to ban drums and gongs. \n“They are brought in to pump up the atmosphere. As long as we support our team and refrain from antagonistic chants, I don’t see anything wrong,” he said. \n“However, we support the call made by the police and we are hoping for a good match. I hope all the supporters behave themselves.” \nRecent clashes between Perak and JDT have been marred by ugly skirmishes between supporters in Johor and Ipoh. \nIn the previous fixture in Larkin, a Perak supporter was allegedly injured by an object thrown by a home fan. JDT won 2-0. \nIt was reported the JDT team had fortified their team bus with surveillance cameras, lighting, and metal grills in preparation for today’s match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T02:23:53.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
