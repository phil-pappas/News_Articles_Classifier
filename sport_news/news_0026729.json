That’s the verdict as “Healthy, Wealthy & Wise” celebrates its first anniversary.\nTampa, FL (PRWEB) October 15, 2015\nImagine walking into a business meeting with the enchanting sound of steel drums playing softly in the background. That’s just one example of how MCAads.com-Russell Johns ( http://myclassifiedads.net ) generates a creative corporate environment as part of the “Healthy, Wealthy & Wise” program it instituted a year ago.\n“We all know that research says music is great for well-being,” explains RaeAnne Meyer, Director of Media Strategy. “Walking into a business meeting with steel drums playing takes your whole mood from corporate to calypso”\nThe Caladesi Steel Band, founded by Dave Holmstrand and Johnny Lowery, conjured up the calypso charm for the MCA-RJ crew. The traditional steelpan instruments the band plays are made from 55-gallon barrels by Tom Reynolds of Tropical Hammer Steel Drum Crafters.\nHolmstrand and Lowery have worked together since the mid-1990s when the two were in the Busch Gardens Steel Drum Band. Besides representing Busch Gardens, they’ve been featured on Nickelodeon, the Jack Harris Show and the Jack Hanna Show.\nWhat’s makes steelpan music so mesmerizing?\n“Many people can’t believe the unusual sound they produce, so we like to let them come up and try it themselves. It’s really something that’s best experienced live,” Holmstrand explained. “The instrument originated in Trinidad and Tobago, and comes in the full range of the orchestra—from bass to soprano.”\nThe band performs at resorts and events all over central Florida, including the Sandpearl Resort on Clearwater Beach, and the Loews Don CeSar on St. Petersburg Beach. Its website is http://www.caladesisteelband.com . Holmstrand said they had a great time at MCA-Russell Johns.\n“The staff wasn’t told we were coming, so it was a nice surprise to those expecting a meeting,” Holmstrand said, adding that, “We’re strong believers in the healing power of music, and companies are hiring us not just for events, but also team-building and wellness programs.”\nBut uplifting music like that provided by the Caladesi Steel Band is just part of the mix at MCA-RJ.\nJames Joiner and his Well Fitness Elements team ( http://fitelementsstudios.com ) helps take care of health part of “Healthy, Wealthy & Wise”—but in reality, healthiness contributes to the other two components as well. How? By reducing absenteeism, increasing productivity and improving morale.\nAnother aspect of HW&W is helping others: MCA-RJ supports causes in the community and encourages co-workers to also get involved.\nExamples include donating to the Angelman Syndrome Foundation, volunteering for the 21st Street Community Garden Project in South St. Petersburg, getting involved with VPK Kids at Evelyn's Christian Home Day Care, partnering with Jazzy Jewels in Tampa to help 10 deserving girls get the Jazzy Jewels royal treatment, launching a campaign to alert parents about the increase in the use of LSD-like drugs in the Tampa Bay area, helping collect canned goods for the needy and, most recently, supporting a new program to help the homeless in Hillsborough County.\nThis holistic approach to building a business has not gone unnoticed: Earlier this year, the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce chose MCA-RJ as a Semi-Finalist for its prestigious “Small Business of the Year” Award.\nDirector of Media Strategy RaeAnne Meyer explains MCA’s business philosophy this way: “We take pride in the success of each and every one of our clients. Being able to play a role in helping companies grow and watching them achieve their goals is a huge motivator for us.”\nHelping keep its staff “Healthy, Wealthy & Wise” is a big part of that effort.\nFor more information on MCA-RJ and how it can help make advertisers and publishers more successful, call (813) 920-0197 or visit http://myclassifiedads.net .\nABOUT: MCA is a full-service ad agency that leverages strategically placed volume buys to help clients target the largest potential audience for the least amount of money.
