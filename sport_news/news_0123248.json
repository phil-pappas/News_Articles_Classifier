I just felt it was the right time to shut it down. (The Battle of Alberta) was one of my favourite games and rivalries to play in, but I want to be a fan and support my friends. I saw the guys after the game and enjoyed it.”\nGlencross and most people in the hockey world expected he’d sign somewhere as a free agent soon after July 1, but he ended up being a victim of the NHL’s youth movement brought on by cap issues in many cities.\nPersonal pre-season tryouts with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Colorado Avalanche didn’t work out in September and early October, so he spent the last couple weeks waiting to see if any other opportunities arose.\n“I had some options to go to Russia and Sweden, but with a young family, I decided I wasn’t going there,” said the two-time 20-goal scorer who played 507 games in the NHL for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, the Columbus Blue Jackets, the Edmonton Oilers, the Flames and the Capitals.\n“It’s unfortunate — that’s a part of the business. There’s nothing you can do. We just decided to look forward to the next chapter. Maybe a door will open in the hockey world. I trust God has a plan for us.”\nUndrafted, Glencross says one of his highlights was scoring in his first NHL game — on his first NHL shot with the Ducks on Jan. 13, 2007 — as well as scoring a hat-trick on Western Night with the Flames\n“Being a kid from a small town (Provost, Alta.), I never thought I’d have a shot to play in the NHL, so by having a pretty good career over nine years, I was living my dream every night I went on the ice,” said Glencross, who plans to stay in Calgary, as the father of two young girls and a boy.\n“I’ve always seen myself as a Calgary Flame, and I’ll retire a Flame, as we got a lot from this city. I’m just enjoying some family time and doing some things I’ve never been able to do — like I just got to take Karter on her first school field-trip.”\nAsked why he wouldn’t keep skating with hopes of catching on somewhere, he sighed.\n“I’m healthy, feeling good and am ready for a new career.”\nSeveral of his former teammates in Washington were shocked to hear he called it quits.\n“That’s too bad — I didn’t see that coming at all,” said former Calgary Hitmen captain Karl Alzner.\n“That’s crazy that happens now — free agency and the cap. He was doing good with us. It’s hard to come in at the end of the season in a big playoff push and learn a new system. You make a mistake, and next thing you’re not in the lineup.”\neric.francis@sunmedia.ca\nwww.twitter.com/EricFrancis\n CURTIS GLENCROSS Left wing, 32, Kindersley, Sask.\nSeason Team GP G A Pts PIM +/-\n2000-01 AJHL Brooks Bandits 60 23 22 45 113 --\n2001-02 AJHL Brooks Bandits 53 42 26 68 163 --\n2002-03 WCHA U.
