Last season, the Rangers opened 1-3-0 with a similarly condensed schedule to start the season and were still 11-10-4 early in December before finishing with an NHL-high 113 points. \nLundqvist made 37 saves — his third straight game with 30-plus saves — but his bid for his first shutout this season ended with center Ryan Johansen shoveling in a goal at 4:35 of the third period to cut the Rangers’ lead to 5-1. \nRookie Oscar Lindberg scored twice in the first period, giving him four goals already. \n“Obviously, he can skate in the NHL,” coach Alain Vigneault said. \nLundqvist was spectacular all game even on the rare times he was caught out of position. \nThat came late in the second period, as Lundqvist skated out of his crease to his left to corral a Blue Jackets’ dump-in. But the puck took a bad bounce off the boards, leaving it dangling at the net as Johansen swiped at it. \nBut Lundqvist dove and managed to knock the puck out of the air and away from the net with his paddle. \nThe Blue Jackets started Saturday night’s game still apparently shell-shocked by the Rangers’ three-goal barrage late in the third period on Friday night. Lindberg scored twice in the opening 5:12 and Dominic Moore made it 3-0 at 5:48. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:22:17.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
