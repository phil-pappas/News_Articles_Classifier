It became a dramatic finish in one of the best match play events in pro golf. \nFor the U.S, which sustained a lopsided loss a year ago in the Ryder Cup, the win helped erase that memory for several of the players like Watson who were on that team. \nThe U.S. has dominated the Presidents Cup, winning nine of 11 times these matches were staged, but none closer than this one at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club in South Korea. The U.S prevailed 15.5 to 14.5. \nPlaying as a captain's pick for his father, Haas was in the last of 12 matches. It became the deciding one. Carrying a 1-up lead against South Korea's Bae Sang-moon, Haas was in good shape in a green side bunker in 2 on the par-5 18th. Bae Sang-moon then flubbed his third shot chip, then put the next one well past the hole. After Haas blasted to about 4 feet, the match was conceded and the U.S. won. \nWatson, the Milton High grad, who is building a home in Pensacola, finished 2-1-2 in all matches. He had a three hole lead heading into the final 8 holes, in his match against Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee, but Watson bogeyed holes No. 16 and No. 17 and both players made par on 18 to end all square. \nBut it was a big for Watson, who played well during most of the four day competition. \nHe teammed with friend J.B. Holmes to form a standout duo in the foursomes and four-ball matches. \nAfter an eventful weekend, which included Watson having his pink-shaft driver snap on the practice range moments before starting Friday’s matches, the Presidents Cup cam down to the 12 singles matches. \nWatson is the fifth match which started at 8:07 p.m. Saturday (Pensacola time); Holmes preceded him in the fourth match. Their only loss was 1-up earlier Saturday against Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace.

Assistant U.S. captain Fred Couples delivered it while waving it in the air like a sword as he was transported on the course in a cart. \nEarlier this week, Watson said the greens are deceptive enough that it presents the hardest element to solve. \n“So for this competition, and especially (Thursday), these tricky greens, it's who makes putts,” Watson said. “If you look, we started off hot, we started off making the putts and then we ended up making the putts. Pairings set for final day as U.S. holds narrow lead at Presidents Cup \n“Right in the middle both teams were not making putts. They looked good, but they didn't go in, so it was all about putting, and this golf course is going to be about putting and controlling the speed and making the ten footers.” \nFollowing this event, Watson is expected to return to Pensacola where he is hosting his annual Bubba Bash for the first time in this community.
