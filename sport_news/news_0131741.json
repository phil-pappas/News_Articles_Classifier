Derek Carr, quarterback, Oakland Raiders ($7,000)\nAll five of Derek Carr's touchdowns this season have come in the last two games as the Raiders' offense has found its rhythm. Oakland faces a soft Chicago defense in Week 4, so it's safe to say that Carr will continue to find success through the air. He has two dependable targets at wide receiver and a strong running game to lean on.\n2. Charles Clay, tight end, Buffalo Bills ($5,200)\nCharles Clay had a big game last week, so some FanDuel owners might be on to him. Still, his matchup is even better in Week 4 as the Bills go up against a Giants' defense that is weak at linebacker and safety. It's going to be tough for them to find someone to cover Clay.\n3. Allen Hurns, wide receiver, Jacksonville Jaguars ($5,300)\nThe Jaguars' passing offense has a friendly matchup against the Indianapolis Colts, and Allen Hurns has been holding steady as the No. 2 receiver. He comes really cheap on FanDuel and has a shot to score a touchdown if Jacksonville is able to move the ball on Indianapolis.\nDraftKings 1. Andy Dalton, quarterback, Cincinnati Bengals ($5,900)\nSpending $5,900 on a quarterback with a strong chance to finish as a top-five quarterback is never a bad value on DraftKings. Andy Dalton and the Bengals have been on fire to start the season, and the matchup against the Chiefs shouldn't scare off anyone. Dalton should continue his strong start to the season while playing at home.\n2. Karlos Williams, running back, Buffalo Bills ($3,400)\nKarlos Williams is in line to handle a full workload with LeSean McCoy sitting out with a hamstring injury. His cost is too low for a running back who has scored in every game this season and will be getting more carries against a banged up Giants defense. He's one of the best values at running back this week.\n3. Melvin Gordon, running back, San Diego Chargers ($4,900)\nAt $4,900, Melvin Gordon's price has finally come down to the point where he can be considered a value. Gordon has been consistent this season but hasn't had that big game that has grabbed the attention of fantasy owners. This week, the Chargers play a weak Browns run defense, and it should be Gordon's best chance at a big game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:12:17.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
