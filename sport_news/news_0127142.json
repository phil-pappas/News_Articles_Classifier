(AP) - Melinda Olson stares at the bar, rearranges the mat beneath it, exhales and jumps. \nShe reaches for the bar with both hands, grabs it and swings like a pendulum. \nThen she takes a deep breath, lets go and flings her body into one final, fast spin, landing squarely on her feet. \nTriumphant, Melinda throws her hands in the air and bows to the bar as if it were a well-matched opponent she has defeated, the Columbia Missourian (http://bit.ly/1M2e1lJ ) reported. \nNearby, her coach smiles and nods, obviously pleased with the routine. \n“She is a tough gymnast who works hard and is one of our younger ones,” said Rodney Gust, who owns Elevate Gymnastics and Fitness where Melinda trains. \nShe is just 9 years old. \nBefore the gymnastics season began this fall, she completed all of the skills required for a Level Four gymnast. This is the first required competitive level in gymnastics, and it means Melinda will have her first chance to go to the state championships in March in Branson. \nTo qualify, each gymnast must score well in four different events - vault, bars, balance beam and floor routine. \n___ \nThis is just the beginning of a long, expensive journey for the Olson family. The New Haven Elementary School third-grader started training when she was 4 years old. She now aspires to become an Olympic gymnast. \nBut her dream comes with a cost. For Melinda to compete this season, it will cost her family almost $4,500, including at least $1,600 in fees required to enter qualifying meets. That includes the entrance fees for five qualifying meets and the state competition as well as hotel costs, mileage and coaching fees. \nLast month, Melinda and her mother, Joy Olson, created a Go-Fund-Me account with the goal of raising $1,800 to cover the fees. They had asked friends and family to contribute to the fund instead of buying Melinda gifts for her birthday on Aug. 23. \nAs of Tuesday, Melinda’s Go-Fund-Me account had raised $625. \nOlson has paid this year’s meet fees with her credit card. Olson said that initially she did not know how she was going come up with the money this year. She has picked up housecleaning jobs to contribute, and her husband’s business is still getting off the ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:33:07.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
