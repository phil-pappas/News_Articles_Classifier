Quick Notes from Saban's press conference: Opening Statement regarding Texas A&M: Can't have mistakes like penalties, getting a punt blocked, mistakes in the secondary, or whether if it's having negative plays on offense the focus needs to be how do you stay locked in, and execute the game plan...that's what we are trying to get accomplished this week Derrick Henry and Minkah Fitzpatrick on SEC honors: proud of these guys On Tennessee: Tennessee game is a special game to a lot of people because of the history and the rivalry. Butch Jones has done a good job, they've gotten better, and could be arguably undefeated or a one-loss team this year, they came back and beat someone when they were behind 21-3. Offensively they are very good, they have good running backs with Jalen Hurd, and quarterback Joshua Dobbs does a good job at both running, and passing, and they've scored a lot of points....Defensively, they play hard and they're physical and they're hard to score on, and that's something that for us, controlling the ball will be a key for us, I think Butch Jones has done a good job, and this is the best team they've had for a while Injuries: Kenyan Drake: will practice today Ryan Kelly: is under concussion protocol, we feel like he will be okay, he's not that bad right now, but he medical staff has to make that decision Distractions at home vs. playing on the road: I never thought it was an issue until this year, but our three best games have been on the road. I think it's a matter of what I've talked about before, and it's staying focused and whether if its family, friends, the atmosphere, the distractions that it can create, you can't let that affect you, we play different ...you're supposed to have a lot of killer instinct to do you're job, all those things should be positive that enhance competition, something that we have to continue to address and do a better job Team growth since Ole Miss loss: I can't speak about that, our team is improving, I don't think as a group of competitors that anyone here is satisfied when they don't have success. I know we have a lot of competitors on the team who aren't satisfied with that game (Ole Miss) and the focus is to play with more consistency and try not to create momentum for the other team by not focusing. On Pass Rush: They (Texas A&M) passed the ball a lot, they weren't able to run it which allows us to play our kind of defense that enhance pressure. I think when its 2ND &5, it's hard to rush the passer, but when it's 2ND &10 it's a lot easier Played 7 straight games, how is team with fatigue mentally and physically: We try to control the work load, we gave the players 2 days off two weeks ago, it goes back to how bad do you want to do I think we are getting better, and this is an opportunity for us to play better in certain areas on our team Penalty when Shaun Dion Hamilton being ejected: He was playing with toughness and playing aggressive, we tell the players you have to see what you hit, and lower your target, all you can do is learn from it, it was intentional, he's played well for us and a good person and I think that's the lesson to be learned Jake Coker on scrambling: He's a big, physical guy I don't want to take his aggressiveness away from him Having 2 running backs: It's going well for Derrick Henry, we would like to get more players involved so that we can spread out some of the load...we would like to get Kenyan Drake more involved. On UT's Joshua Dobbs: They had a good game against us last year, he's gotten better, you can tell he has a great understanding of the expectations, he's a good leader because I see the players are responding positively to him, he's had a great year so far Targeting Rule: I think we should continued to have increased player safety, which the targeting rules have done, they aren't perfect, and we will continue to do that, I don't want to see any of our players hit in the head, I think it makes us coach better on making guys aware of how to block and tackle for player safety. Eddie Jackson improvement: Eddie has always been instinctive, he's made a lot of plays at corner...once he learned what to do, learned how to apply it, he reads and reacts to things very quickly Minkah playing Star: Right now he's a corner, as we've done in the past as a freshman, we've played so much nickel, but Minkah could play safety if he wanted to play safety, but corner is a position that's hard to fine, and he's been a good one for us so far", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:15:48.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
