He made things look easy because he kept his game simple and he made the right decisions. I was pleasantly surprised at his first game.” \nChris Kelly said Chara’s return should be a lift to the young defensemen. \n“Z’s our leader on and off the ice,” Kelly said. “I think if you’re a young defenseman just watching him play, you can really learn a lot, how great his gap is to how composed he is with the puck, just little things that he does extremely well. I know if I was a young defenseman, I’d be watching him really closely.” \nChara was not in the mood to analyze and dissect how he felt physically, saying he was fine and that he wants to “keep improving.” \nHe was a little more concerned about how the team is playing as a whole, which is not well. \n“We’ve just got to put together 60 minutes,” Chara said. “We always say that we have to respect the game plan for a full 60, you can’t be just playing 20 or whatever. You’ve got to be focused on what’s the right play, the right time, and you have to make the right decision. I feel that we mean well, but we are not always making it easy on ourselves.” \nGone too soon \nDefenseman Matt Irwin cleared waivers and was assigned to Providence. \nThe free agent signee’s minus-5 rating after two games was concerning, but the swiftness of the action was a bit eye-opening. \n“I didn’t see that coming, but it shows that there is that urgency and that decisions will be made,” defenseman Adam McQuaid said. “You’ve got to have a bring-your-best-every-day kind of attitude. Obviously there is the business side of the game and tough decisions that are made like that. But you worry about your game, and you have to make sure you’re fighting every day to stay here and bring something to the table.” \nKelly concurred. \n“It’s always tough to see a guy like that put on waivers, but it is part of the business,” Kelly said. “Management’s going to do what they feel is best for this hockey team. As a player, all you can do is go out there and play and play to the best of your abilities.” \nAdded Torey Krug : “It’s tough because (Irwin is) such a good guy and you don’t want to see players go through that. But we know we have to do our jobs.” \nThe B’s can stash Irwin’s $800,000 salary in Providence and it won’t count against the cap, as teams are allowed to hide up to $950,00 in the minors. \nRoy honored \nThe B’s signed former Boston University hockey player Travis Roy to a one-day contract, commemorating the 20th anniversary of his freak accident in a game that left him paralyzed. Roy dropped the puck for the ceremonial faceoff before the game, and the B’s have donated $50,000 to the Travis Roy Foundation. ... \nWhile Patrice Bergeron did not have a good game, he rebounded from an unusually poor night in the faceoff circle against Montreal (12-for-28) with a strong effort on the dot against Tampa Bay (14-of-23). ... \nWith his game-winning goal, Steven Stamkos posted his 500th NHL point. ... \nThe B’s have lost three straight to start the season for just the eighth time in their 91-year history. ... \nThe Lightning’s win was their first regular-season victory at the Garden since March 25, 2010, snapping a 10-game losing streak on Causeway Street.
