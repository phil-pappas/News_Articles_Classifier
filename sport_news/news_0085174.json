The victory improves the Hillbillies' record to 7-0 on the season and extends their winning streak to 18 games. \n\"I thought our first [string] team did a really nice job,\" head coach Lou Racioppe said. \"We had an awful lot of yards rushing and threw some key passes when we had to.\" \nVerona pounded the Millburn defense and rushed for seven touchdowns on the night. Riggio recorded five scores, while junior quarterback Zack Zaccone and junior running back Chris Aldiero each added one. \nVerona scored on its first possession due to some timely plays from the offense. The unit converted two fourth downs to set the stage for Riggio's first touchdown run of the game. However, Millburn struck back on its first possession of the second quarter to make the score 7-3. Riggio scored the next two touchdowns for Verona, using long runs down the sideline to set up goal line scores of eight and two yards, respectively. He also caught a pass in the end zone from Zaccone to complete a two-point conversion to make the score 22-3 in favor of the Hillbillies. \nZaccone capped off the first-half scoring for Verona when he scrambled for a touchdown run at the 2:59 mark of the first half. The Hillbillies' held Millburn scoreless for the remainder of the second quarter and took a 29-3 lead into the half. \nRiggio and the Verona offense returned to action in the second half when the senior found the end zone for the fourth time of the night. He fumbled the ball away at the goal line, but recovered it in the end zone for a 14-yard touchdown to give the Hillbillies a 36-3 lead. \nMillburn returned the following kickoff for a touchdown to make the score 36-10, but Riggio found the end zone again on the following possession. The senior scored his fifth and final touchdown of the evening on a 60-yard dash up the sideline. \n\"He does what he does every week,\" Racioppe said. \"He gets behind his big lineman and makes the right cuts and today he was able to break through for some long runs and that's something we like to see.\" \nThe five touchdowns represent a career-high for the senior running back. \n\"It's a great feeling, but I couldn't have done it without the [offensive] line,\" Riggio said. \"It was all the line. I give credit to every single one of them. They all performed amazing and they helped me do what I did today.\" \nArmed with a 43-10 lead, Verona's special teams unit recovered a Millburn fumble on the following kickoff, which set the stage for Aldiero's four-yard touchdown run. \nThe Hillbillies surrendered a late touchdown to make the score 50-17, but the damage had been done and Verona secured the victory. Senior lineman AJ Pengue said the team executed the game plan well and credits the coaching staff for the team's success. \n\"I think we played very well. We just did what we were coached to do and that's how we came out with the victory,\" Pengue said. \"When we do what we were coached to do, the game will work out.\" \nThe victory over Millburn will help boost Verona in the standings due to the team's status as a Group 4 school. \n\"This is a big win against Millburn, especially because it is a conference game,\" Pengue said. \"It gives us a lot of power points and hopefully it will put is in a good place for states.\" \nRacioppe said he mostly liked what he saw on the field Friday night, but said one unit will have its work cut out for them in practice this week. \n\"We're certainly going to be looking to improve our special teams,\" Racioppe said. \"Our kickoff team needs a lot of work and they're going to get it this week.\" \nVerona will next play Saturday, Oct. 31 when the Hillbillies host Orange in the second-to-last game of the regular season. \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:33:20.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
