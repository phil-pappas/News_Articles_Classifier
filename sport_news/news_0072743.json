If I did, I’d be betting with both fists. \nSo instead of all that we’ll deal with what we do know — just which player general manager Alex Anthopoulos added at the trade deadline to plug the leaks and give the crew a boost is having the best post-season? There are five players to choose from, two position players in left fielder Ben Revere and shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. On the pitching front there are relievers LaTroy Hawkins and Mark Lowe and, of course, Price. \nGoing from the bottom to the top we start with Hawkins, who is hanging them up at the end of the season. Retirement is something I’m keenly aware of and in Hawkins’ case it looks as if he should have called it quits after August. \nHawkins has made three appearances in the playoffs and pitched a total of 1.2 innings, He has allowed seven runs on seven hits and in what should be his final big-league appearance, Tuesday in the 14-2 rout, the right-hander faced three batters and went walk, single, single. All three runners would come around to score. It’s a sad way to go out, but there it is. \nNo. 4 at this point should be Price. He was mediocre in his start against Texas and mediocre in a relief role in the same series. In Game 2 of the LCS he had that schizophrenic start. Overall he’s 1-2 with a 7.02 ERA and has allowed 17 hits in 16.2 innings. \nNo. 3 would be Revere, who in the LCS is just 3-for-19 and overall is 10-for-42 (.238). He hasn’t been the table-setter he was over the final six weeks of the regular season. \nSo that leaves Lowe and Tulowitzki and Tulo has had a far greater impact than Lowe even though the right-handed reliever has been steady as he has allowed just one hit and two runs in six appearances. He is one of just three bullets left in manager John Gibbons’ bullpen. \nTulowitzki hasn’t made a lot of contact in the playoffs but when he does he has caused a lot of damage. It was his three-run homer in Texas in Game 3 that helped turn that series around and in the ALCS he has banged out a three-run homer and that big three-run double in Wednesday’s victory. \nIf the Jays go on to win the next two games and Tulo comes up with a couple more key hits he may well wind up as the series MVP. \nTHOUGHTS OF CHAIRMAN GIBBONS \nThe Jays are 4-0 in elimination games and make of that what you will. \nAll Gibbons knows is his team is still playing so they’ve got a chance. \n“We were playing good, really good,” he said of their play in those four games. “Yeah, really, look at the elimination games, our offence has really come to life in those games. But we’ve been saying all along, that’s the key is scoring runs. Maybe we can pull it off again. \n“Our goal, of course, was to bring it back to Kansas City. We did that. And we’re riding high right now. But we always ride high, if you want to know the truth. We don’t always win, but we feel good.” \nWALKING A TIGHTROPE \nThe Jays’ big trio of Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion has yet to really break out in the ALCS, but all three have had their moments and remain a clear and present danger to the Kansas City pitchers. \nOn Thursday, Royals manager Ned Yost was asked if they’ve pinpointed any particular Blue Jay as being the guy they do not want to beat them, such as Rangers manager Jeff Banister did with Encarnacion in the Division Series. \n“That’s a good question,” Yost replied. “You’ve got three guys, well, you’ve got more than three guys, but you’ve got three guys in the top of that lineup with Donaldson and Bautista and Encarnacion that can do a lot of damage with one swing. So you’re kind of playing with fire a little bit pitching around any of those guys with those guys behind them. \n“But what you try to do, you continue to try to make good pitches and nullify their power. You can’t give in in situations and just 3-1, 2-1, say ‘Okay, here it is, hit it.’ That doesn’t work with those guys because they do hit it a long way. \n“So you have to have that mindset that I’m not giving in. I’m going to make my pitch. And if I don’t make my pitch, I’m going to try to eliminate as much damage as you can, and end up giving a walk instead of a homer.” \nMost times, that’s easier said than done. \nPASS ANOTHER TEST \nEvery Jay rejoiced in Wednesday’s victory, none moreso than Chris Colabello, who hit a solo homer in the second inning to send the Jays on their way. He was asked afterwards if the game was as much a test of character as it was of talent? \n“I think they all are at this point,” he said. “There’s no tomorrow if you don’t win. We’ve been through a bunch of hurdles all year. We were 7 1/2 games back (of the Yankees) when we made those moves at the (trade) deadline. We had to claw back from that. We were down 2-0 in the Division Series and we clawed back from that. Anything less than this would surprise me from this team, anything less than our best effort. \n“That doesn’t mean we’re going to go out and win the next two games but I tell you what, we’re going to leave everything we have out there I know that.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:21:14.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
