Related \nClick here to get last night's scores. \nOn Saturday, two games on the Big Island were scheduled but only one of them had the teams actually play. \nKa'u vs. Pahoa ruled a draw after no officials showed up, an unfortunate way to end the season for both teams. \nBut it was an exciting night for the Vikings who became this year's BIIF D-1 champs in their 41-20 win against Kealakehe. \nAnd on Kauai, the Kapa'a Warriors remain undefeated in 2015 with their 36-0 win against the Menehunes. They've now outscored their last six opponents 226-zero. \nIt's a number that ties KIF single-season points scored record with the 1996 Waimea team. It's also a number that breaks the record for allowed KIF points with zero. Waimea set the last one in 1981. \nOn the Valley Isle, Maui High takes down Kamehameha at 35-19. Warriors are done for the season at 3-6. Sabers get Baldwin next in the MIL D-1 championship game. \nLast week, the top two teams in the ILH battled it out. Saint Louis rallied from a 14-9 halftime deficit to defeat the previously undefeated Punahou at 30-14. \nTonight, the Crusaders beat Punahou AGAIN and claim their first ILH title since 2010. Final score: 27-23. \nFirst round of the state tournament starts November 6th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:48:13.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
