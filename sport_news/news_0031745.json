Snogo Promises Enhanced Safety And Performance For Every Level Of Rider.\nSalt Lake City, Utah (PRWEB) October 15, 2015\nSnow sports enthusiasts and SNOGO founders Chase Wagstaff, 26, and Obed Marrder, 27, are set to unveil a new kind of ski-bike that promises enhanced safety and performance for every level of rider. After three years of research, design and prototype testing, the co-founders will launch their SNOGO ski-bike with a Kickstarter campaign planned on November 10th, 2015 where they hope to raise $40,000 to fund their initial manufacturing costs. It’s their goal that this product will bring people of all ages and abilities back to the ski slopes.\nChildhood friends Wagstaff and Marrder loved winters in Utah but hadn’t found that one winter sport they were passionate about. Learning a new snow sport took time and could be frustrating; consequently neither one really stayed with skiing or snowboarding. But they were determined to find an activity that would keep them outdoors during the winter. In 2011, they decided to try ski-biking and immediately fell in love with it. But after exhaustive research on existing ski-bike brands, they realized that certain safety and functionality issues were missing. Over the next year, they partnered together to produce a ski- bike that they could share with riders of every age and skill level.\n“With some snow sports, the learning curve can be tough and after too many face plants, you just want to give up,” says Marrder. “We wanted to develop something that people of all different abilities could enjoy almost immediately.”\nAnd that includes the Baby Boomers-- the generation that built the snow sport industry has been aging out of it at an alarming rate. SNOGO founders also learned that the ski industry will likely face dramatic declines in participation and is working to grow its younger fan base. According to the Snow Sports Industry of America (SIA), only 15% of first-time riders are converted in to long-term participants.\n“We believe that we can play an important part in the turnaround that this industry needs,” Marrder explains. They anticipate that the SNOGO’s intuitive bike-riding motion will be well-received by first-time riders. Their goal is to grow the conversion rate to 25% over time.\nAbout the SNOGO Ski-Bike\nThe SNOGO Snobike combines the thrill of downhill-mountain biking and skiing in a safe and easy-to-master format. SNOGO’s unique design features three skis for enhanced performance, stability, and control while meeting all resort safety regulations. Because of its unique design, SNOGO Snobikes have minimal impact on the body as force is absorbed through the front shocks. To learn more about SNOGO Snobikes, check out our vimeo. Design and technology are patent pending.\nPreLaunch Kickstarter Page\n //www.prweb.com/releases/snogo/kickstarter/prweb13006752.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://pitchfuse.com/project/snogo-winter-sports-reinvented/944", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/snogo/kickstarter/prweb13006752.htm"], "published": "2015-10-15T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:19:24.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
