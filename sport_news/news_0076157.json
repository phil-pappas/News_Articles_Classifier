That set St. John's well on the way to a 56-0 rout of the Knights in MIAC action at Laird Stadium. \n\"I was tired after the kickoff return, then the defense stopped them and I was the punt returner,\" said Bungum, who finished with three catches for 134 yards as his team improved to 4-1 in conference play and 6-1 overall. \n\"Then we threw that deep ball right away. I was pretty gassed just after those two plays. But that's OK. I'd rather be tired from plays like that than not being tired from plays that didn't work.\" Video and postgame interviews from Saturday's victory over Carleton \nBungum's heroics were part of a big day for the Johnnies' passing game. Senior quarterback Nick Martin finished 10 of 12 passing for 257 yards and three touchdowns and the Johnnies threw for 279 yards as a team. \nIt marked the second-straight week they have thrown for 245 yards or more. \nAnd Saturday's win marked the first time during the past two seasons that St. John's has won a game when senior All-American running back Sam Sura did not cross the 100-yard mark. Sura rushed for a pair of touchdowns in the second quarter, but finished the day with 18 carries for 94 yards (though he did have a 53-yard touchdown run called back after a holding call early in the second quarter). \n\"We're evolving every week as an offense,\" Johnnies coach Gary Fasching said. \"And we're getting better and better. Nick has done a great job the past couple of weeks. He's playing really well. We're utilizing a lot of different guys. Sam is the focal point of what we do offensively. But we know we have other guys who can make plays too.\" \nStill, St. John's did rush for 216 yards in all, and both Sura and backup Antoine Taylor had a pair of touchdown runs. \nYet Sura didn't seem to mind ceding the spotlight. \n\"We were able to open up the deep passing game today and that's something we've been looking to do,\" Sura said. \"Josh made some great plays. Everybody did their jobs well.\" \nThe Johnnies defense, meanwhile, held Carleton (0-6, 1-7) to 197 yards of total offense and forced three turnovers. St. John's was credited with one sack. But the Johnnies were often successful at applying pressure on Knights quarterbacks Zach Creighton and Ethan Trujillo. \n\"It started with (Bungum's kickoff return for a touchdown to start the game) and we never got going offensively after that,\" said Creighton, who was picked off twice and fumbled the ball once. \"You can't get down three touchdowns early against a top-15 team like that and expect to have any chance. \n\"Plus I turned the ball over three times. You're not going to have much success if your quarterback does that.\" \nSt. John's has won three straight since a 35-14 loss to still-unbeaten St. Thomas (a 45-14 winner Saturday over Bethel) on Sept. 26. And the Johnnies have scored 41 points or more in each of those three games. \nScoring points will be even more important next week when the team returns home to face Augsburg and its potent offense at 1 p.m. on Halloween afternoon at Clemens Stadium. \nThe Auggies (2-3, 3-4) out-dueled St. Olaf 57-35 Saturday and put up 722 yards of offense in the process. \n\"We're just taking it one week at a time,\" Bungum said. \"That sounds cliche, I know. But that's really all we can do. We know we have to win all of them if we want to have a good shot at the playoffs. \n\"But we can only focus on one game at once. And next week is Augsburg.\" \nFirst quarter \nSJ — Josh Bungum 96 kickoff return (Alexi Johnson kick) 14:43 \nSJ — Bungum 80 pass from Nick Martin (Johnson kick) 11:10 \nDrive: 1 play, 80 yards, 10 seconds. \nSJ — Bungum 49 pass from Martin (Johnson kick) 5:35 \nDrive: 6 plays, 78 yards, 3:10. \nSecond quarter \nSJ — Sam Sura 8 run (Johnson kick) 8:07 \nDrive: 11 plays, 66 yards, 6:07. \nSJ — Antoine Taylor 2 run (Johnson kick) 4:27 \nDrive: 4 plays, 29 yards, 1:43. \nSJ — Sura 9 run (Johnson kick) 1:00 \nDrive: 4 plays, 61 yards, 37 seconds. \nThird quarter \nSJ — Dan Harrington 4 pass from Martin (Johnson kick) 8:14 \nDrive: 6 plays, 55 yards, 3:09. \nFourth quarter \nSJ — Taylor 3 run (Johnson kick) 3:35 \nDrive: 11 plays, 60 yards, 5:14. \nIndividual statistics \nRushing: SJ — Sam Sura 18-94, Kai Barber 5-30, Antoine Taylor 10-22, Zack Sundly 2-22, Dusty Krueger 3-19, Johnny Benson 1-12, Josh Bungum 1-11, Nick Martin 2-6; C — Andy Gustafson 10-30, Zach Creighton 11-19, Tyler O'Keefe 7-11, Christian Zaytoun 2-3, Logan Emholtz 2-(-3), Ethan Trujillo 3-(-3). \nPassing SJ — Martin 10-12-0 257, Benson 3-5-0 22; C — Creighton 8-13-2 72, Trujillo 5-10-0 59, Zaytoun 1-1-0 9. \nReceiving: SJ — Bungum 3-134, Nick Simon 3-68, Sura 1-39, Malik Mills 1-11, Barber 1-10, Taylor 1-6, Billy Gagliardi 1-5, Dan Harrington 1-4, Brett Watercott 1-2; C — Chris Madden 6-63, Dane Birkeland 5-56, Gustafson 2-16, Matt Mensinger 1-5. \nLeading tacklers (solo-assists): SJ — Carter Hanson 1-7 8, Peyton Thiry 1-6 7, Parker Anderson 0-7 7, David Franta 2-3 5, Jack Pietruszewski 1-4 5, Drew Glenzinski 0-5 5; C — Spencer Francis 3-6 9, Eric McGregor 4-4 8, Merrick Ducharme 2-6 8, Dylan Saline 4-3 7, Mitch Heflin 2-5 7. \nInterceptions: SJ — Trevor Warner 1, Jeremy Piper 1; C — none. \nSacks: SJ — Thiry 0.5, Glomb 0.5; C — none. \nSt. John's: 4-1 MIAC, 6-1 overall.
