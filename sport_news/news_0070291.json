It was later learned he had been captured, but died in captivity. He was assigned to Battery A, 503rd Field Artillery Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division. • Cpl. Robert P. Graham, of San Francisco. He was declared missing in North Korea on Feb. 13, 1951. It was later learned he, too, had been captured, but died in captivity. He was assigned to Company A, 13th Engineer Combat Battalion, 7th Infantry Division. Bill would help disabled vets employed by federal government The House recently passed a bill that would grant disabled veterans hired by the federal government 104 hours of sick leave upon being hired. The leave would be for those who have a VA disability rating of 30 percent or higher, for the purpose of attending medical appointments, and would expire after 12 months on the job. Veterans benefitting from this law would continue to accumulate sick leave under existing rules, but this extra time would ensure veterans have enough leave as they start their careers to make their medical appointments. The Senate passed a similar version of this bill, and differences will need to be worked out before the bill can become law.
