Muguruza beat sixth-seeded Angelique Kerber 6-4, 7-6 (5).\n\"It was a really tough match and I had to struggle today,\" Muguruza said. \"Venus is a legend. I'll have to go out there and do my best to win against her and I think it's going to be a great final.\"\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
