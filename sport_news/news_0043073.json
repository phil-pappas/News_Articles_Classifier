The room was used to punish her, the suit says.\nA representative from the school district couldn't offer immediate comment Friday.\nSeclusion rooms are allowed under Oregon law, with restrictions. But in 2013, state lawmakers banned school districts from locking students in free-standing \"seclusion cells,\" which critics had likened to containers designed to traumatize students. The bill didn't prohibit educators from placing students in rooms that some say help calm out-of-control students.\nThe girl attended Riverbend Elementary School and had been diagnosed with \"multiple developmental disabilities,\" the suit says.\nOn Jan. 26, 2012, a court-appointed special advocate arrived at the school unannounced to visit her and was told by a teacher that the girl was \"napping,\" according to the suit. When questioned further, the teacher said the girl had a \"meltdown,\" the suit states. The teacher then led the advocate to the student.\nThe advocate \"discovered her lying in a fetal position on a bare concrete floor in an approximately 8'x6' cold concrete room, with only thin carpet on the floor and no apparent padding or heat,\" the suit says. \"The room had no ventilation or windows and ... (the girl) was alone in the dark, without a pillow, mattress, chair, or any other furniture whatsoever.\"\nBecause of public controversy over seclusion rooms, new state rules that took effect in July 2014 established more specific requirements -- including that the walls of seclusion rooms are at least seven feet apart and that the rooms have lighting, ventilation and a window in the door that allows the entire room to be viewed.\nAccording to the lawsuit, the teacher told the advocate that school district policy calls for placing misbehaving students in such \"scream rooms.\" Parents aren't told that their children have been put in the rooms, and the district doesn't or didn't keep records on using the rooms, the suit says.\nA mental health professional and a caseworker had been assigned to the girl through the Oregon Department of Human Services, the suit says. Neither of them -- nor her mother -- were told that she'd been placed in the small room, the suit states.\nThe girl's mother has since died, and her maternal grandfather, as her guardian, filed the suit on the girl's behalf. The suit claims that her time in the room worsened her problems -- magnifying her Oppositional Defiance Disorder, among other problems.\nThe suit claims that use of the seclusion room was \"an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct.\"\nThe family seeks $25,000 in economic damages and $275,000 for the girl's trauma and suffering. She is now 10.\nThe lawsuit was filed by Salem attorney William Ghiorso.\nSeclusion rooms are used by various districts around the state. For example, a Beaverton School District spokeswoman said the district has five seclusion rooms, and they all meet state specifications.\n-- Aimee Green\nagreen@oregonian.com\n503-294-5119\no_aimee", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/o_aimee"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:14:26.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
