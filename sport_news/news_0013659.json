The initiative, now in its ninth year, targets the criminal enterprises responsible for the commercial sex trafficking of children.\nThe youngest victim in this year’s operation was 12 years old. Of the 149 victims recovered, three of those minors were transgender, and three were males.\nDuring the operation, 90 victim specialists provided on-scene direct services to the victims while 105 child victims received on-site direct services which may have included crisis intervention and resources for basic needs like medical, food, clothing and shelter. Due to the size of the operation, FBI victim specialists coordinated with local law enforcement victim advocates and non-governmental organizations who provided additional support to the victims.\nOperation Cross Country IX is the largest in the nine-year history of the initiative, with 53 FBI field offices and 73 Child Exploitation Task Forces, which include federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, taking part in the operation in 135 cities across America, including New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport. Nationwide, more than 500 law enforcement officials, including investigators and officers from federal, state and local law enforcement organizations, conducted both “in-call” and “out-call” operations in hotels, casinos, truck stops and in other areas known to be frequented by both prostitutes, sex-traffickers, and their customers.\nParticipating in the operation were officials from the FBI, U. S. Attorney’s Office – Eastern, Middle, and Western Districts of Louisiana, Homeland Security Investigations, Louisiana Department of Justice – Office of the Attorney General, Louisiana State Police, Louisiana Department of Probation & Parole, Bossier City Police Department, Bossier City Marshal’s Office, Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Office, East Baton Rouge District Attorney’s Office, East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office, Baton Rouge Police Department, Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, Kenner Police Department, New Orleans Police Department, Shreveport Police Department, St. Charles Parish Sheriff’s Office, and the DELTA Task Force.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
