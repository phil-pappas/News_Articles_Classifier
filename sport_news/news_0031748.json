After all, neither of his leg-muscle injuries this season occurred in games.\nHe first strained his left calf in the team’s walk-through the day before the first exhibition game. Then his hamstring became problematic after he fully participated in practice on Sept. 17.\nQuarterback Jay Cutler believes he’ll quickly reconnect with Jeffery in game situations.\n“I’ve thrown stuff to him over the last couple of weeks as he’s eased into it,” Cutler said. “I think the biggest thing with him is just staying in shape and being able to stay in game shape, because the rest of us are kind of there.”\nMarquess Wilson, a seventh-round pick in 2013, leads the Bears with 234 receiving yards on 15 catches. Eddie Royal’s 18 receptions are tied for second-most on the team and are the most among receivers. Undrafted rookie Cameron Meredith had four catches last Sunday, including two for 38 yards on the two fourth-quarter touchdown drives.\n“We’ve got a lot of confidence in a lot of guys, all the way down the line,” Cutler said. “When Alshon does get back, it will take a load off of some of those guys. But we’ll also be able to stay fresh and rotate guys in.”\nGase is eager to re-incorporate into the offense Jeffery’s exceptional ability to catch contested throws. And he’s also mindful of Jeffery’s individual progress..\n“I think I’m more excited for him to get to where he needs to get to be able to play,” he said, “and being able to sustain it for the rest of the year.”\nrcampbell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @Rich_Campbell\nPrivacy Policy Alshon Jeffery Jay Cutler Chicago Bears Detroit Lions", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56200cdc/turbine/ct-bears-jeffery-injury-spt-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:03:05.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
