Dale Grdnic Correspondent \nPITTSBURGH — With its offense sputtering along for more than three quarters, Virginia’s defense tried to change the momentum in its Atlantic Coast Conference opener against Pittsburgh on Saturday at Heinz Field. \nThe Cavaliers were successful by recording their first and second takeaways this season and also scoring a defensive touchdown, but too many inconsistencies and missed opportunities by the Virginia offense helped the Panthers secure a 26-19 victory that wasn’t certain until 28 seconds remained. \nU.Va. quarterback Matt Johns completed a fourth-and-23 play for 32 yards to wideout T.J. Thorpe to get near midfield and then hit Keeon Johnson for 11 yards to the Panthers’ 42. But four straight incompletions, including the final one on the sideline, ended Virginia’s chances. Some believed pass interference could have been called, but there were no flags. \n“That’s all part of the game,” Thorpe said. “You’re not going to get every call, but I still think I could have made that catch. … We came up short, but had we played the first half the way that we played the second half, we would have put ourselves in a better situation at the end.” \nVirginia (1-4, 0-1 ACC) trailed 17-3 after the first quarter, as Pitt (4-1, 2-0) got big plays from two tight ends. Scott Orndoff caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from Nate Peterman, and J.P. Holtz also had a 28-yard catch. Qadree Ollison scored on a 4-yard run, and Chris Blewitt kicked a 33-yard field goal for the Panthers. \nThe Cavaliers had a chance to answer, but a 71-yard burst off the left side by running back Albert Reid to the 6 ended in a 33-yard field goal by Ian Frye. A delay penalty and false start seriously hampered U.Va. \n“When you get into the low red-zone areas, like we call it, with the opportunity to score the touchdown, you have to score,’’ Virginia coach Mike London said. “Two back-to-back penalties really cost us, so we had to settle for a field goal instead of a touchdown. Those are opportunities to get points, and you have to capitalize in those situations.” \nVirginia’s defense appeared to turn it on after the first quarter. The Cavaliers pressured Peterman and shut down the Panthers’ running game for the most part, but the biggest play was turned in by two seniors. Linebacker Mike Moore hit Peterman to force a fumble, and end Kwontie Moore corralled the ball and ran 15 yards into the end zone to cut the lead to 17-10 at halftime. \n“They gave us a few things that we hadn’t seen, and they took advantage of that,” U.Va. junior linebacker Zach Bradshaw said. “But that scoop-and-score really got us going. Any time you get a score on defense, that’s a big boost.” \nVirginia also thwarted a late drive by Pitt when linebacker Micah Kiser drilled Ollison as he attempted to score. Ollison fumbled into the end zone, and free safety Quin Blanding recovered. The Cavaliers got the ball at the 1, because that was where the back lost possession. \nThe ensuing offensive series for Virginia was all too familiar. After 1 yard gained on the opening two downs, Johns dropped into the end zone on third-and-long and was dropped for a safety. \nJohns was 17-for-33 for 209 yards and one touchdown, but he also threw an interception that was returned 51 yards to set up a Pitt touchdown. Johns came up short on U.Va.’s next series, and the Cavs had to settle for a 26-yard field goal by Frye. But Johns came back with a 32-yard touchdown pass to Canaan Severin with 5:50 left to give U.Va. a chance at the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:30:21.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
