Maybe no one outside of the Tech fan base really believed. Now, things are much different.\nFresh from a road upset of Arkansas, Tech (3-0) has a chance to make a statement against No. 3 TCU at Jones AT&T Stadium on Saturday.\nIn the process, the Red Raiders can equal their win total from 2014.\nIt won't be easy, even with TCU fielding a depleted defense. Seven probable starters were missing in the second half against SMU, although defensive tackle Davion Pierson is expected back Saturday from the aftereffects of a concussion.\nIf Tech needs any more incentive, it just has to look at the TCU score from last season: 82-27.\nThere haven't been any posters or reminders in the locker room, coach Kliff Kingsbury said, because there's no need.\n\"I don't think you forget losses like that,\" Kingsbury said. \"I know as a player I didn't. It's an in-conference game so that should be motivation enough. But I'm sure they haven't forgotten how that felt last year.\"\nKingsbury hasn't. After the game, he even questioned his players' efforts.\n\"I just remember watching some of those guys come out of the locker room at halftime already defeated,\" Kingsbury said this week, \"and that was what I was referring to in the postgame press conference.\"\nSo far, Tech has looked nothing like that dispirited group this season, although TCU represents by far the toughest test. The Red Raiders haven't trailed in any of their three games.\nThe major changes from a year ago at quarterback and on defense look like masterstrokes.\nQuarterback Patrick Mahomes ranks among the national leaders in total offense (fourth) and passing touchdowns (tied for sixth) in the Bowl Subdivision.\nThe sophomore, who won the starting job in preseason camp from Davis Webb, has produced big hits as well as big numbers. A block on Arkansas safety Rohan Gaines produced a big Tech gain early.\n\"You play for guys like that,\" center Jared Kaster said. \"When you see that on the film, that's what this game is about. The preparation and demeanor that he has is through the roof.\"\nThe defense allowed just three points in the second half at Arkansas and ranks eighth nationally in turnovers forced under new coordinator David Gibbs.\n\"They do it in practice,\" Gibbs said. \"All spring and all two-a-days I thought they did a nice job trying to rip and punch and do all the things you have to do to create fumbles.\"\nTCU and quarterback Trevone Boykin will be the biggest test so far. Boykin, who threw seven touchdown passes against Tech last season, accounted for 504 yards and six TDs last week against SMU.\nOne thing Kingsbury is certain about - despite a big road win, Tech will be ready.\n\"Going through what they went through last year, there won't be any letdown,\" Kingsbury said. \"It was not fun. Eighteen of those guys started on that team and they don't want to go through that again.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:42:04.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
