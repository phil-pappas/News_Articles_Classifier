All they would need is for rival Montreal Impact to take at least two points off Orlando City SC in the day’s later match. If TFC ties, the team would still finalize a spot in the post-season if Montreal beats Orlando.\nIt’s the Reds’ first chance at clinching this season.\nBut even if everything works in the team’s favour, in turn etching this cohort of names into club history, its players will leave the champagne showers to the Blue Jays.\n“We’re not in the playoffs yet . . . if we do get into the playoffs (Saturday) things aren’t done,” a typically focused Michael Bradley said adamantly following training Friday.\n“It’s not why any of us are here, just to say that we got into the playoffs.”\nSure, the team will be proud and excited if a playoff spot becomes a sure thing, Bradley admitted, but the Reds haven’t won anything yet.\n“We’re very confident about the group that we have and about being able to finish this first part of the job and get ourselves in (the playoffs), but at that point its just one step along the way,” the captain said. “It’s important the concentration and the commitment doesn’t waiver one bit. Actually, it has to go up.”\nAnd while the Union sits four spots behind Toronto in the Eastern Conference going into Saturday’s game, Bradley expects a challenging match given Philadelphia’s playoff hopes, as slim as they may be, have yet to be officially extinguished.\n“Their season’s on the line, so we expect that whoever steps on the field for them will do so ready to give everything until that final whistle blows and until there’s mathematically no chance for them to still get in.”\nToronto is going for their third straight home victory and third win of the season against the Union, who lost to Sporting Kansas City on penalties in the final of the U.S. Open Cup on Wednesday night\nSaturday’s match is the closest Toronto has to a sure-thing in its remaining four games. Next up, the Reds host the second-place New York Red Bulls, then the third-place Columbus Crew before travelling to Montreal to face an Impact side bolstered by striker Didier Drogba in the final game of the season Oct. 25.\nReds coach Greg Vanney expects a similar game to Toronto’s last two matches against the Colorado Rapids and Chicago Fire. In both those games, the home side had to be alert on the transition, shielding itself from dangerous counter attacks.\nToronto did so handily against the Rapids, but conceded a goal within a minute of kickoff against the Fire. The Reds rallied to secure three points for Toronto last week, but the comeback was another first of the season.\nStarting well Saturday is a must, Vanney said.\n“It’s not about getting, necessarily, a goal in the first five minutes. It’s about about getting ourselves into the game, into a good rhythm before we give up anything.”\nVanney said it’s up to Toronto, nearly injury-free and achieving some consistency having started the same 11 players for the past two weeks, to take advantage of the Union’s desperation on their way to an “important” result.\n“The longer the game goes and the harder the game is for them, the less they have to play for in the end.”\nLike Bradley, Vanney doesn’t have any bubbly on ice. But with three points in hand he expects Toronto’s coaching staff will watch Montreal play Orlando with added interest Saturday night.\n“Obviously there’s a little more attention to that this weekend with all the possibilities that are out there.”\nMore on thestar.com\nNew Zealand defeats Georgia, qualifies for Rugby World Cup quarter-finals", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://www.mlssoccer.com/standings"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:19:12.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
