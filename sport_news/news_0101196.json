Hopefully, things go in the right direction.\" \nHextall said Pyett, who is being treated by the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, will undergo chemotherapy four straight days every three weeks before doctors will remove the tumor. He's already undergone what Hextall said was a \"battery of tests.\" The GM said the tests have come back in a good way and there are positive signs in Pyett's fight. \nThere's no question, Hextall said, the whole organization is affected. \n\"He's in our family. He's under our umbrella and he knows that,\" Hextall said. \"We're going to do everything we can to get him the best care. I've already told him if he needs hotel rooms down our way while he's getting the treatment, he's welcome to it. We're going to look after him like he's ours. He's under our umbrella and we care about our players.\" \nOn Twitter: @Jeff_Neiburg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:36:01.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
