PETERSBURG, FLA. - Troy Tulowitzki is listed in the Toronto Blue Jays' starting lineup for their game against the Tampa Bay Rays.\nTulowitzki hasn't played since Sept. 12 when he cracked his scapula and bruised muscles in his upper back after colliding with teammate Kevin Pillar in a game against the New York Yankees. He is scheduled to bat seventh in Friday's game.\nHe had a homer, two doubles and walked once in six plate appearances of a simulated game against a pair of minor league pitchers before the AL East champions started a regular season-ending, three-game series against the Rays.\nDavid Price, scheduled to pitch Game 1 of the AL Division series Thursday, also took part in the simulated game and struck out Tulowitzki on a called third strike and got a fly ball to centre.\nToronto obtained Tulowitzki from Colorado on July 28 in a multi-player deal. He's is hitting .232 with the Blue Jays, but they're 30-8 with him in the starting lineup.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos 'I woke up on park benches some mornings': New revelations in Rob Ford's past drug use\n0\nLeafs' Babcock returns to Joe Louis Arena\n0\nOregon gunman had cache of 13 weapons: Federal agent\n0\nHeroic army vet shot 7 times trying to stop Oregon gunman\n0\nCops Taser man inside Oshawa Tim Hortons\n0\nGovernment, cops raid raw-milk crusader's farm\n0\nHurricane Joaquin batters the Bahamas, expected to miss Atlantic Canada\n0\nSanta Claus running for mayor of North Pole\n0\nMarco Muzzo appears in bail court\n0\nTroy Tulowitzki listed in Blue Jays' lineup against Rays\n0\nZabi Akbari - Witness To Kirby Rd Fatal Crash\nVaughan crash eyewitness\nPlenty Of Work Left For Leafs\nPat Kane Video\nRaptors media day\nMore from Blue Jays Has Taylor Swift cursed the Toronto Blue Jays? 0\nTampa Bay Rays' tale in 2015: Arm trouble 0\nBlue Jays' David Price will be well rested for first playoff start 0\nJose Bautista's homer was historic 0\nBlue Jays are Orioles manager Buck Showalter's 'pick to win' 0\nInside Toronto sun.com News\nGovernment, cops raid raw-milk crusader's farm 0", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-03T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:52:39.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
