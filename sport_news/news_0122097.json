I have played only few Test matches and I need to play a lot more before I can carve a niche on my own. If you ask me MS is 9/10 and I am 2.5/10,\" Wriddhiman told PTI on sidelines on the eve of Bengal's Ranji Trophy match against Delhi.\n\"Why he is 9 and I am 2.5? Because his achievements are such. One of the finest ODI players and also had accomplishments in Test cricket. He has had many crucial Test match knocks. I have to play a few myself before I come out of his shadows,\" said the Bengal stumper.\nWriddhiman's nearest rival for Test spot is Naman Ojha, who had decent outing in Colombo Test which the former missed due to a hamstring injury.\n\"It's simple. If I perform I will play and if it's Naman, who performs it will be him. I am under no illusions. I have got chance in two games because I scored two half centuries. If I don't perform I would be replaced.\n\"That holds for any cricket team. When you are a relative newcomer, chances will be less compared to established names, who would get more chances. But you have to grab whatever comes your way,\" he said.\nThe jury is still out whether he can fit in as No 6 in Test team which would allow Virat Kohli to play five bowlers.\n\"I don't think I have problems With batting No 6. I have batted against second new ball and with the tail also. So I think it is not as big an issue it is made out to be. I am comfortable batting at No 6,\" the 30-year old said.\nAsked about his preparation for the upcoming SA series, Wriddhiman said, \"Obviously, with Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel, both pace and bounce would be factor.\nI have done separate training against short ball in Kolkata recently. Taking throwdowns with emphasis on rising deliveries. I have confidence that I can tackle both Steyn and Morkel.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:45:56.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
