Bowyer and 5-hour ENERGY have been partners for four seasons, winning three races and finishing runner-up in the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup championship. Starting with the Feb. 21, 2016, Daytona 500, Bowyer will race Chevrolets for HScott in a technical alliance with Stewart-Haas Racing and Hendrick Motorsports. \"I am very thankful for the continued support and commitment from 5-hour ENERGY, and for Harry Scott Jr. for putting this opportunity together,\" said Bowyer. \"My relationship with everyone at 5-hour ENERGY is something I hold with great value. There have been some real unknowns for my career in the past couple of months, but I'm happy that my future is secured and full speed ahead.\" HScott Motorsports has competed full time in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series for two seasons, fielding Chevrolets with Hendrick Motorsports support. HScott Motorsports team owner Harry Scott Jr., said this is a watershed moment for his young organization. \"This is a really important step for HScott Motorsports and one I felt our team needed to take to elevate to the next level of NASCAR Sprint Cup competition,\" said Scott. \"Clint is a proven winner and Chase participant. For us to compete at a higher level we needed all of the right elements to come together. I believe those elements came together with the driver in Clint, sponsorship from 5-hour ENERGY and the extended relationship with Chevrolet, Hendrick Motorsports and Stewart-Haas. This opportunity has brought an unprecedented level of excitement to our entire organization.\"\"Clint has been a big part of our marketing program the past four seasons and has been incredible with our retailers and customers,\" said Manoj Bhargava, founder of Living Essentials, the parent company of 5-hour ENERGY. \"Anytime there is change there is opportunity to make the program even stronger, and that is our intent with our new partnerships.\" Bowyer, 36, is a 10-year veteran with eight victories, two pole positions, 58 top-five finishes and 163 top-10s in Sprint Cup competition. Earlier this week, Stewart-Haas Racing announced that Bowyer will drive SHR's No. 14 Chevrolet in 2017 replacing Tony Stewart who'll retire at the end of the 2016 season. Michael Waltrip Racing, Bowyer's team for the past four seasons, announced in August that it would not field full time Cup teams in 2017.
