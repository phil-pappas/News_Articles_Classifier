(AP) â€” Eastern Kentucky has moved Thursday night's Ohio Valley Conference game against Tennessee Tech north to Georgetown College after a security threat led school officials to cancel classes for the remainder of this week.\nEKU cancelled classes on all of its campuses Wednesday morning to allow law enforcement to investigate \"an escalating threat\" originating on social media after discovering graffiti that threatened to \"kill all\" this week. The school's public safety office said there was no imminent danger but increased police presence on the Richmond campus.\nThursday's game moves about 30 miles north to Georgetown's Toyota Stadium, which formerly hosted training camp for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. The Colonels (2-2, 1-0 OVC) will try to bounce back against the Golden Eagles (2-3, 1-1) following last week's 34-27 overtime loss at Kentucky.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:32:06.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
