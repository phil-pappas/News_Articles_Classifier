He fired a second consecutive three-under 69 to snare the title, four shots ahead of Australia's Aron Price.\n\nBut it was local hero Singh who caught the eye in the final round on the course he designed for the Aus$1.125 million (US$820,000) event. Singh, who has not won an event for seven years and was in 33rd positon after Thursday's opening round, hit a seven-under 65 to shave two shots off the course record.\n\nThe veteran managed seven birdies to finish joint third with New Zealand's Ryan Fox and Australian Nick Cullen, five shots behind Kuchar. Kuchar attributed his victory to \"solid\" golf in challenging conditions, particularly during the early rounds. \"I felt I was surviving but played some really steady, good golf and that was a real difference,\" he said.\n\nThe Fiji event is co-sanctioned by OneAsia and the Australasian PGA.\n\nLeading final-round scores (Australian unless stated)\n\n284 - Matt Kuchar (USA)\n\n288 - Aron Price\n\n289 - Vijay Singh (FIJ), Ryan Fox (NZL), Nick Cullen\n\n294 - Daniel Valente, Brad Shilton (NZL)\n\n295 - Matthew Guyatt, Peter Wilson Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:27:52.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
