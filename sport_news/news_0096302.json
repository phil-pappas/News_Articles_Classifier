She added that the world needs more love, and that's why she made an effort to attend the vigil.\n\"I felt like I needed to show solidarity as a fellow student and human being who hurts to see other people hurt,\" Andrade said.\nThe gathering was orchestrated by the Portland City Council and timed to coincide with a prayer vigil in Roseburg. Portland Mayor Charlie Hales opened the floor; he was followed various faith leaders who spoke about looking to a higher power for guidance.\nâ€” Nuran Alteir\nnalteir@oregonian.com\n503-294-4028\n@whatnuransaid", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/whatnuransaid"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:13:48.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
