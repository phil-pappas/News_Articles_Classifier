Gillespie / Capital Gazette) Bill Wagner Contact Reporter bwagner@capgaznews.com \nNavy coach Ken Niumatalolo talked all week about how impressed he was with Tulane's defensive front. \nNiumatalolo insisted the Green Wave's collection of down linemen and linebackers were as good as any the Midshipmen had seen, and that included Notre Dame's. \nIt was hard to believe considering Tulane ranked at the bottom of the Football Bowl Subdivision statistics in nearly every defensive category. The Green Wave were allowing 38.5 points and 426.7 total yards per game. \nNiumatalolo wasn't just blowing smoke and trying to pump up an opponent that Navy was favored to beat by 23 points. The Green Wave stymied the Midshipmen's triple-option offense, keeping the announced crowd of 32,033 on the edge of their seats until deep into the fourth quarter. \nOn a day its offense struggled mightily to move the ball, the Navy defense came up with a pair of huge plays that turned the tide. Defensive end Will Anthony recovered a fumble at his own 1-yard line while safety Lorentez Barbour made an interception to set up the clinching touchdown as Navy pulled away for a 31-14 victory over Tulane on an overcast day in Annapolis on Saturday. \nNavy took advantage of two turnovers by Tulane in its own territory with time winding down in the fourth quarter to tack on two late touchdowns. \nQuarterback Keenan Reynolds scored two rushing touchdowns to inch closer to the NCAA record in that category as Navy improved to 5-1 overall and 3-0 in the American Athletic Conference, keeping pace with 18th-ranked Memphis (7-0, 3-0) and No. 21 Houston (7-0, 4-0) in the West Division. \nTemple stacked nine defenders in the box and dared Navy to throw, which it did just well enough to win. Reynolds completed 7 of 11 passes for 134 yards. Wide receiver Jamir Tillman had three catches for 61 yards while slotback Calvin Cass Jr. caught a touchdown toss from backup quarterback Tago Smith. \nNavy was held to 134 rushing yards, easily its lowest output of the season. The Midshipmen came in ranked third nationally with 335.4 rushing yards per game. \nIt marked the first time that Navy won a game with more passing yards than rushing yards since 2010 against archrival Army. \nQuarterback Tanner Lee completed 22 of 31 passes for 205 yards to lead Tulane (2-5, 1-3), which was playing in Annapolis for the first time in 10 years. The Green Wave was on the doorstep of cutting their deficit to three points early in the fourth period when Lee fumbled at the Navy 1-yard line after being stripped by inside linebacker Daniel Gonzales. \nNavy played perhaps its worst half of football this season in taking a narrow 10-7 lead into intermission. The Midshipmen needed 13 plays and nearly seven minutes to move 42 yards for a touchdown on their first possession then did virtually nothing offensively the rest of the way. \nTulane went three-and-out on the game's opening possession and a poor punt gave Navy great field position at the visiting 42-yard line. A chop block penalty on guard Ben Tamburello threatened to derail a methodical march, but a 10-yard completion from Reynolds to Tillman helped keep things alive. The Mids converted a pair of fourth down attempts on the drive, which ended with Reynolds taking a keeper 5 yards to the end zone. \nIt was the 74th career rushing touchdown for Reynolds, giving him sole possession of second place on the all-time NCAA chart behind former Wisconsin tailback Montee Ball. \nThe Midshipmen managed just one first down before having to punt from deep in their own territory on their second possession. The Green Wave took over at the home team's 40-yard line and capitalized on the short field with tailback Dontrell Hilliard bursting off-tackle for a 19-yard touchdown that tied the score. \nUnable to get anything going on the ground, Navy was forced to throw and Reynolds completed two long passes on the ensuing possession. A 23-yard strike to wide receiver Thomas Wilson got the Mids out of the shadow of their own goal-line and a 41-yard bomb that was dropped perfectly into the arms of Tillman set up first-and-goal at the 3. \nLinebacker Nico Marley made a huge play on third down, firing into the backfield as though blasted out of a cannon to throw fullback Shawn White for a 5-yard loss. Navy had to settle for a 25-yard field goal by Austin Grebe and a 10-7 lead at the 5:14 mark of the second period. \nTulane had a chance to tie at halftime, but a 49-yard field goal attempt by Trevor Simms was way short. \nNavy was limited to 44 rushing yards in the first half, its lowest output in two seasons. It was the first time since a loss to Western Kentucky in 2013 the Mids failed to run for at least 100 yards in the first half. \nNavy's offensive struggles continued on the opening possession of the second half as consecutive plays resulted in a loss of 10 yards and a punt. Once again, the Mids took to the air to move the ball with Reynolds finding slotback DeBrandon Sanders streaking down the middle for a 36-yard gain deep into enemy territory. Ezell scored on the next play, blasting through a nice hole on the left side and barreling 9 yards into the end zone to make it 17-7 with 5:23 left in the third quarter. \nTulane seemed poised to pull back within a field goal when it drove to the Navy 1-yard line on the ensuing possession. Lee appeared to pick up a first down on a quarterback sneak, but had the ball ripped away by Gonzales with Anthony recovering the fumble. \nThat turnover was the obvious turning point in the close contest with Navy coming off its own goal line and holding the ball for nearly five minutes before having to punt. Tulane regained possession on its own 15-yard line with just over six minutes to go, but Lee tossed an interception on second down with Barbour making the pick at the 36-yard line. \nNavy then put the game away on a 1-yard plunge by Reynolds that increased the lead to 24-7 with 3:38 remaining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:40:07.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
