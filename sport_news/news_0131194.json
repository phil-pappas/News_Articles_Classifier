The one-day tournament has a weigh-in at 3 p.m. \nTournament updates will be available on the Southern Garrett Bass Slayers Facebook page. \nWinegardner and McClosky won the 2014 high school tournament and then competed in the national championship at Kentucky Lake this past summer, but did not finish in the prizes. \nThe club will send five other angling teams as well. The team of Ryan Roszell and Justin Peck placed 6th in the 2014 Maryland tournament. Trent Lohr and Troy Cumerlato finished 8th. Competing for the first time will be the teams of Michael Mayles and J.T. Mullins, Quinn Iden and Zachary Warnick, and Devan Hamrick and Austin Smith. \nMichael A.
