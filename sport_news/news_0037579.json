It ends with a dizzying tumble of images and the sound of gunshots that killed the young driver. \nNow a Michigan court will have to sort out who’s to blame in a deadly police shooting that began with a simple traffic stop and no hint of violence. \nDeven Guilford, 17, had just finished playing basketball at his church and was driving to see his girlfriend on the evening of Feb. 28 when he was stopped by a sheriff’s deputy in Roxand Township, a small community west of Lansing. \nHe was the third motorist pulled over that night by Sgt. Jonathan Frost for flashing high beams at the officer’s SUV, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court by Guilford’s family. \nThe young driver asked why he was stopped and insisted the officer’s high beams were on. Frost said the SUV was new and the lights were brighter than on other vehicles. He repeatedly demanded the teen show his driver’s license and vehicle registration. \nGuilford, who told Frost he was using his cellphone to record the interaction, said he had his license but told the deputy that he didn’t “have to see it.” \nSitting behind the steering wheel, Guilford also said: “You had your brights on, sir. I’m not lying to you. I was just doing that to be polite. I didn’t want you to flash someone and have someone go off the road and crash.” \nThe officer responded, saying “Do you realize that if you had complied with this traffic stop, it would have gone a whole different way for you?” \nThe rest of the encounter unfolded quickly. \nGuilford held up his cellphone, and the officer ordered him to get out of the car. Once the driver was outside the vehicle, the officer told him to get on the ground by the roadside. He refused Frost’s orders to drop the phone, and the officer kicked it from his hand. \nAfter telling the teen to put his hands behind his back, the officer shot him with a Taser, but the stun gun either did not work or did not disable Guilford. The sergeant’s body cam recorded the teen getting up and coming toward Frost, followed by the sound of gunshots. Guilford’s phone also recorded audio of the shots, seven in all. \nFrost later wrote in an investigative report that the teen knocked him to the snowy ground and repeatedly punched in the head. \n“I felt as though I was going to lose consciousness and made the decision to shoot my attacker,” Frost wrote in the report supplied to The Associated Press by Guilford family attorney Cynthia Heenan. \nThe officer said he feared that if he were knocked out, the teen “would take my gun and shoot me with it.” \nPhotos taken by the sheriff’s department immediately after the confrontation show Frost bleeding from cuts to his face while being treated by paramedics. \nUnlike some other police shootings, race is not a factor in this confrontation. Both the teen and the officer were white. \nEaton County Prosecutor Doug Lloyd reviewed a state police investigation and said Frost would not be charged. \nIn their wrongful-death lawsuit, Guilford’s family says the teen’s civil rights were violated and that Frost used excessive force in a traffic stop that was prompted by nothing more than a flash of bright headlights. \nState law prohibits glaring headlights that may distract an oncoming driver, not the flashing of high beams, according to the lawsuit. \n“Deven didn’t think he should have been pulled over in the first place,” Heenan said Friday. “He thought he was being a good guy and a good driver in alerting somebody that their lights were on.” \nThe family is seeking unspecified damages for Guilford’s pain and suffering prior to his death, plus burial expenses and loss of financial support to his family, among other things. \n“We are outraged at the huge miscarriage of justice done to our son,” Guilford’s family said in a statement. “For three months, we agonized in confusion, trying to figure out how our son, who had never even been in a serious fight, was shot seven times coming from basketball at church and going to his girlfriend’s to watch movies.” \nThe Associated Press left messages Friday with Eaton County Controller John Fuentes and a law firm representing the county and Frost. The officer’s home telephone number could not be found. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:45:54.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
