ST. LOUIS, Mo. - \nFor a guy who earned the tag of postseason hero two years ago, Michael Wacha isn't exactly inspiring a whole lot of confidence these days. \nThat's what allowing 43 baserunners and 21 runs over 24 innings in September will do. But the St. Louis Cardinals will call on Wacha in a critical Game 3 of the National League Division Series on Monday against the Chicago Cubs and 22-game winner Jake Arrieta. \nOne man who's willing to bet on Wacha is a guy who knows something about pitching: Adam Wainwright, the staff ace who just returned to active duty last week after a torn Achilles had sidelined him for just over five months. \n\"I think his highs far outweigh his lows,\" said Wainwright, speaking before the Cardinals' 6-3 loss Saturday. \"He was one of the biggest pieces of getting us to the World Series in 2013. He's got great stuff. We have tremendous confidence in Michael.\" \nWhether it's because his rhythm was thrown off by skipping a start or because his command has gone the way of the four winds, Wacha pitched to a 7.88 ERA in September, reaching six innings just once. \nSt. Louis has to hope a new month means the old Wacha. \nCopyright 2015, Schurz Communications", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:07:12.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
