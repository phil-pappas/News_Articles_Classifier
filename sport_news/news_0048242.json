Rod Aydelotte AP i Order Reprint of this Story WACO \nBaylor quarterback Seth Russell understands the embarrassment of riches that surround him as he goes through his progressions before deciding which receiver to target for one of his passes. \nHe likened the process to going through the buffet line at an all-you-can-eat restaurant and spotting several of your favorite entrees. \n“Absolutely,” said Russell, who has thrown 15 of the 17 touchdown strikes that have landed in the hands of Baylor receivers this season. “You can’t ask for anything better than this. This system is definitely quarterback-friendly. Everybody can make the play. If the ball’s in the air, I know they’re going to come down with it.” \n8 TD catches by Coleman, most among FBS receivers \nRussell, a first-year starter, has four players in his receiving corps averaging at least 18.2 yards per catch and pulling down more than a catch per game heading into Saturday’s showdown between No. 5 Baylor (3-0, 0-0 in Big 12) and Texas Tech (3-1, 0-1) at AT&T Stadium in Arlington (2:30 p.m., WFAA/Ch. 8). Six receivers have caught scoring strikes and eight different players have receptions of 20 yards or longer. \nBaylor’s depth at the position is unique. Among Big 12 schools, only Baylor has multiple receivers (Corey Coleman, Jay Lee) who rank among the league’s top six in receptions per game and receiving yards per game. \nEven more unique, in many ways, may be coach Art Briles’ ability to balance the egos of his receivers with only one football to distribute. Briles, who played receiver during his college days at Houston, suggested that issue “has been around the last 50 years at that position” and is one of the first topics he addresses when new playmakers arrive on campus. \n“Our deal is always about being a great teammate. That’s the hardest thing that you have to try to influence on these guys when they come out of high school, because they’ve been the team,” Briles said. “When you’re the team, you don’t have to worry about being a teammate. So our job is to teach these guys to become great teammates. \n“It’s a constant challenge. But we’ve got a lot of guys that are good leaders, like Corey, that understand that and are good influences in that category.” \nColeman, a fourth-year junior and all-America candidate, leads the nation with eight touchdown receptions. He’s taken almost half of his team-high 17 catches into the end zone. Coleman also ranks second among FBS receivers in yards per game (153.3) and fourth in yards per catch (27.1). \nIf one person does it, we’re all representing the same name and it’s exciting. Baylor WR Corey Coleman \nLee, a fifth-year senior, averages 18.2 yards per grab. He joins Coleman, TCU’s Josh Doctson and West Virginia’s Shelton Gibson on a four-player list of Big 12 receivers with more TD catches than games played in 2015. Lee (14 catches, 255 yards) has four touchdown receptions, including three in a season-opening 56-21 victory over SMU. \nIt is no accident, Coleman said, that the two longest-tenured veterans in the mix are the only Bears who have collected double-digit receptions through the first three games. The seniority concept is discussed regularly among Baylor receivers and has been since Coleman, as a newcomer, heard similar sentiments from NFL-bound talents Kendall Wright and Terrance Williams. Coleman said he and Lee led the talk this fall. \n“Everyone’s not going to get the ball as much as he wants. But guys understand that,” Coleman said. “We told them, ‘Some times, you’ve got to wait your turn. It doesn’t mean you’re not good. It’s just the way it plays out. And when it’s your turn, you want the younger guys to be excited for you.’ \n“The big thing is you’ve got to be excited for your teammates. When Jay Lee scores three touchdowns, I feel like I scored three touchdowns. And when I put up big numbers, he feels like he got big numbers, too. So if one person does it, we’re all representing the same name and it’s exciting.” \nThat extends to veterans reveling in the success of younger players who post bigger statistical seasons. Lee embraced that tenet last year when he finished with 41 catches but watched Cannon (58 catches, 1,030 yards, eight TDs) earn Freshman All-American honors by having one of the most prolific breakout seasons in school history. \nBecause four receivers typically take the field at the same time and coaches rotate personnel frequently, Lee said diva-sized egos are not as much of an issue as outsiders might envision. \n“I don’t think there’s a lot of competition in the room because I know the ball is going to get to all of us some way, somehow,” Lee said. “It doesn’t have to be a set play for me. It can be a scramble drill. We’re just happy for each other when we catch balls, move the sticks and get in the end zone.” \nThat is why it would not surprise Lee if the Bears’ leading receiver against Tech turns out to be Cannon (6 receptions, 147 yards, two TDs), Lynx Hawthorne (six receptions, 51 yards, one TD) or a newcomer like freshman Chris Platt, who has averaged 19.5 yards per catch. \nThe shared approach has worked, especially when paired with a ground game that has averaged an FBS-best 379.7 yards per game. \n“We have that deep-ball throw with our receivers any time we want it,” left tackle Spencer Drango said. “It puts a lot of pressure on teams. If they play the run, we’re going to throw for 400 yards.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:09:37.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
