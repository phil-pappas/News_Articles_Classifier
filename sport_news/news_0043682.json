Today, a French outlet named Canal+ is claiming that Chelsea was one of those suitors. Martial signed a £36 million deadline deal to join Manchester United, a record setting fee for a teenager, and the third highest amount in United club history. \nHowever, this report in the French media claims that Chelsea offered Martial even more money than that. \nA tweet by CanalPlus magazine read : ‘According to our information, Chelsea had proposed more money than Manchester United for Anthony Martial but the player dreamed of the Red Devils.’ That’s a pretty bold claim there. If true, it really conveys how much Anthony Martial really wanted to join the Red Devils. Martial only had 13 career goals in senior competitive play before moving to Old Trafford. However, he’s got four goals in his first seven appearances with United. Paul M. Banks owns, operates and sometimes writes The Sports Bank.net , which is partnered with FOX Sports Engage Network.
