Comer running back Tay McElrath is one of his team's silent leaders, according to head coach Mike Battles. Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 10:06 pm | Updated: 10:12 pm, Tue Oct 13, 2015. B.B. Comer preparing for must-win game against Midfield By SHANE DUNAWAY, Home sports writer Annistonstar.com In a must-win Class 3A, Region 3 high school football game, B.B. Comer will play host to Midfield at Legion Stadium on Friday in Sylacauga. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. The Tigers (4-3, 2-2) lost to the Patriots 45-6 in 2014 and have zero wins in three games against them. Head coach Mike Battles said his team must show more fight than it did in a 27-6 loss to Fultondale last Friday. “We played about like we practiced,” he said. “They came out there and hit us right in the mouth. We didn’t hit them back. Once they found out we weren’t going to hit them back, then they got to hitting even harder. That ball game got bad. “We’re disappointed that we lost. We had opportunities to get back in the ball game and we had opportunities to win. The score wasn’t an indication of the game. We gave up three big plays and we got the ball down there close going down, and we just did not make plays.” He added a lack of execution played a big part in the loss. “We worked on things all week long,” Battles said. “We had them open. We had exactly what we wanted and we didn’t take advantage of them. If we don’t go out and play – do what we do in practice, go out and play and do the things we practiced all week, then we are wasting our time. “Our kids know it, and they understand where we went wrong. What we’ve done this week is try to have a little attitude adjustment.” Battles said he’s already seen improvement in practice compared to last week. “They’re doing a lot better than they did last week,” he said. “I think we’ve got a little bit better attitude right now. Practice has gone a lot better, and we want to go in there and try to win a ball game.” When asked if he said anything to help motivate his players following the loss, Battles said not beating the Wildcats should be motivation in itself. “If we won that ball game, that would have pretty much put us in the playoffs, but we didn’t,” he said. “So now we’ve (put ourselves in) a little hole. And now all them other teams are waiting to just throw the dirt on and keep on going. “We have to win out. We have to win our next two (region) games or we’re not going to the playoffs. That’s all there is to it.” He added he hopes the improved practices yield a victory and a more physical effort against Midfield (5-2, 3-1). “We hope so, because if we don’t, we’re pretty much going to be done playing on Oct. 30,” he said. “We want to go out there, we want to play and do our jobs. We want our kids to do their jobs and we’re still in the thick of things.” Battles said while his team doesn’t have very vocal leaders, he expects plenty out of his team. “We’ve got some guys on the team that try to be leaders who are silent leaders,” he said. “They let their actions speak. I think Tyre McKinney and Tay McElrath – they’re the two who go out there and get after it every Friday night. They’re our silent leaders.” Contact Shane Dunaway via email at sdunaway@dailyhome.com or on Twitter @DailyHome_Shane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:37:33.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
