(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) (Michael Dwyer) Comments \nFan support for Red Sox television broadcaster Don Orsillo has been rampant since the announcement that his contract had not been renewed for next season. \nSunday was Orsillo's last game calling the Red Sox for NESN after 14 seasons. He signed a multi-year deal with the San Diego Padres last week. \nWhile NESN opened its broadcast with Orsillo's partner Jerry Remy saying they would be airing tributes in between innings for Orsillo, the network lost audio and video feed several times throughout the early innings. \nNevertheless, an unidentified fan paid special tribute to Orsillo. Before the game, a plane flew over Progressive Field in Cleveland with a banner that read, 'Red Sox Nation (Loves) Don Orsillo.' \nNESN employees who have worked with Orsillo haven't taken the news lightly either. Remy noted during the broadcast that longtime NESN cameraman Joe Stafford wasn't scheduled to work the final series, but flew out from Providence to Cleveland on Sunday to be with Orsillo for his final broadcast. Thank you Red Sox Nation for this plane over the stadium. pic.twitter.com/LO9PtjZ1mn â€” Don Orsillo (@DonOrsillo) October 4, 2015 \nFollow MassLive.com Red Sox beat reporter @jcmccaffrey on Twitter.
