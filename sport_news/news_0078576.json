Desir batted down his throw at the line of scrimmage. \nOn the next play, Bednarczyk took another three-step drop and tried a pass to his left, and again, Desir got a hand in the passing lane. \nOn fourth down, freshman kicker Gerald Smith lined up for a 30-yard field-goal attempt, but Desir’s outstretched arm deflected it wide right and the Tigers entered halftime up five, not two.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:21:53.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
