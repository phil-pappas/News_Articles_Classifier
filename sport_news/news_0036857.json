His lone bogey came on seventh.\n\nAndy Sullivan made hay whilst the sun shone on the second day as the Englishman opened up a commanding lead courtesy of a second successive round of 64.\n\nWith adverse weather over the weekend threatening to curtail the tournament for the second year in succession, the jovial Englishman is in pole position to claim his third European Tour title of the season after moving to 14 under par.\n\nSullivan's closest challenger at Oceanico Victoria Golf Course is Belgian Thomas Pieters, who climbed to 11 under par courtesy of a round of 66.\n\nAustrian Bernd Wiesberger, currently seventh in The Race to Dubai, shares third place on ten under par alongside Eduardo De La Riva after the duo carded respective rounds of 64 and 67.\n\nDue to the adverse weather forecast the tournament organisers have agreed to begin the third round at 8am with a 'shotgun start'.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:52:56.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
