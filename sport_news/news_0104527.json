They are there to give an at-large audience a topic of conversation heading into the new campaign. But, once the players hit the field, all records and statistics from the previous season are thrown away and become a distant memory. \nOne team that has been buried at the bottom of the Greater Middlesex Conference over the past two years, and wasn’t given a fighting chance when the preseason predictions were released at the end of August, has made some noise with consistent play. \nThe New Brunswick High School girls soccer program had been in a downward spiral, but with some important advice from coach Michael Shymanski, the team has marched its way to the top of the Gold Division, and was named one of the top eight in the GMC Tournament – which gave the Zebras a bye into the first round. \nAfter winning a mere three games last season, and unable to claim a victory in 2013, Shymanski thought an attitude adjustment would be the most fitting medicine for the open wound that developed for the Zebras. \n“When I was the JV coach there were a lot of things that I saw, as a coach and former a former athlete, that I knew was not going to make these kids successful,” Shymanski said. “Kids were coming late to practice and kids were missing games, this stuff was allowed and it continued. \n“When I had the opportunity to take over the team, the year prior there was a zero win season. My first year as a head coach I put in changes, there was a lot more discipline and more accountability. Going into this year I kept building it up. I kept stressing the importance of family; we always have to be there for one another. The kids really bought into it.” \nPlayers came into the 2015 campaign with open minds and positive spirits, a far different circumstance from previous years. Shymanski implemented a high pressure practice system, one that would allow them to prevail in tightly contested games. \nBecause of the new Shymanski style, the Zebras are now in an unfamiliar territory. They currently sit at 11-2 on the season and grabbed hold of sole possession of the GMC Gold Division title. The road to a division title was not easy as they were caught in some hard fought battles. \nNew Brunswick even started the year with a 2-2 record. Past team’s would have hung their heads and allowed the season to go south, but this year’s group wanted something more. They wanted to set a new image for their program. \n“That is the old school, typical New Brunswick way, ‘Oh, we are down, let’s give up,’” Shymanski said. “That is something I completely washed out of their heads from the beginning. I kept on talking to them and said, ‘Listen, this is a marathon. It’s an extremely long season. If you are down you have to figure out a way to get back up.’ If you go through our box scores, a majority of our wins are come from behind wins. When they are losing they are not scared. They found a way to get it done.” \nSenior leadership has given the Zebras an edge against their opponents. No player on the roster is a better example than goalie Erica Rodriguez. She is a four-year starter in net, and according to Shymanski, no player is fiercer than his goal keeper. \n“My goalie is the toughest girls I have seen in my entire life,” Shymanski said. “She has no fear. If you come to one of our games, she is charging out of the box, slide tackling, stopping a one-on-one breakaway, with reckless abandonment. She is unbelievable to watch.” \nAlthough the seniors have set the tone for the team, a sophomore has been the go-to asset on offense. Abigail Luengas has been given the freedom to roam on the field, which has led to a team-high 15 goals and six assists. \n“Abigail is going to be amazing going forward if she keeps working the way she is now,” Shymanski said. “She has 15 goals this year and she’s one of the reasons we are doing as well as we are doing. I think there are one or two games where she hasn’t scored. She’s really buying into what my seniors and I are talking about: The family atmosphere and never giving up.” \nNew Brunswick’s best season in the past 10 years was a 7-10 record in 2009. Other than that particular season, New Brunswick has not eclipsed the four win mark in a single year. The program is full of intuition and undeniable perseverance. They are no longer a slouch on the schedule, but instead, they have become a team to watch in postseason play. \n“The kids a couple of years ago were used to losing and they were okay with it. The kids I have now, they bought into my philosophies,” Shymanski said. “The big thing I’m trying to get in their heads now is don’t get complacent with what we have done. The season is not over. \n“I gave them the example of, ‘If your first job is a cash register at a supermarket, your goal is to become the manager. If you become the manager, then your goal is to become the boss of the manager.’ I want them to realize, whether it’s soccer or life, you have to keep striving to get better. Do something better every day.” \nStaff Writer Steven Macri: smacri@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1S1jYUM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:37:06.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
