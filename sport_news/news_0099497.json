Bolt won the 200 more comfortably.\n\"It's one of the joys to go out there and to compete against the best because when you go out there and beat the best it shows that you are the greatest,\" Bolt said in anticipation of facing Gatlin again next year.\n\"So for me, I live to compete and I look forward to my team mate Yohan Blake coming back ... he's been out for pretty much two seasons.\"\nThe Jamaican, whose initial day of training was thwarted by rain, sounded a warning to Gatlin, Blake and anyone else considering trying to stop him at next year's Olympics.\n\"Justin Gatlin says he's coming, but for me, I'm much more focused,\" Bolt said.\n\"I'm starting the season in a much better shape than I did the last one, so it is only forward from here.\"\n(Editing by Greg Stutchbury/Mark Lamport-Stokes)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:10:41.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
