That had a familiar ring to it because the Seahawks (3-4) also posted a first-half shutout at Levi's Stadium last Thanksgiving night, when they parlayed a 13-0 lead into a 19-3 win.\nThe 49ers next will take an 0-3 road record into St. Louis for a Nov. 1 visit against the Rams (2-3).\nWith the 49ers offense unable to make any big plays Thursday night, their defense resumed season-long woes, though Tramaine Brock and Kenneth Acker made interceptions deep in 49ers territory to prevent further damage.\nThis marked the 49ers' fourth straight loss to the Seahawks, dating back to the 2013 season's NFC Championship game. It was the ninth straight meeting the 49ers failed to score 20 points on the Seahawks.\n\"This San Francisco 49ers football team and the fans should be ashamed,\" former 49ers cornerback Deion Sanders said on CBS' halftime show, according to ProFootballTalk.com. \"The management and ownership should be ashamed.\n\"This team is three years removed from a Super Bowl and they're putting that product,\" Sanders continued. \"Colin Kapernick has nowhere to go, nowhere to throw. ... This is pathetic for a team that was in the Super Bowl just a few years ago. They lost a darn good coach and some really good players.\"\nThe 49ers ended Seattle's shutout bid when Phil Dawson made a 35-yard field goal, with 1:21 left in the third quarter for a 17-3 deficit. It was Dawson's 11 consecutive successful field-goal attempt.\nIt took only one series for the 49ers troubled defense to create a 7-0 hole. The Seahawks marched 61 yards for that touchdown, which came on Marshawn Lynch's 1-yard plunge on third-and-goal. Lynch converted on fourth-and-inches three snaps earlier.\nSeattle's lead climbed to 17-0 when Russell Wilson lobbed a 43-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Lockett, who got past Brock's coverage with 2:44 left until halftime.\nOnly four days after snapping a four-game losing streak and beating the Baltimore Ravens 25-20, the 49ers offense retreated into early-season form.\nKaepernick got sacked on three of the final five snaps before halftime, and he completed 8-of-13 passes for only 44 yards in the first half. Back-to-back sacks in the fourth quarter raised the Seahawks tally to six sacks against the 49ers' embattled offensive line.\nMeanwhile, the 49ers defense proved quite generous in allowing big plays during the first half. Lynch and Thomas Rawls each had a 17-yard run, and Wilson had completions as long as 23, 36 and 43 yards. Far too often were Seahawks wide receivers left wide open.\nMaking matters worse for the 49ers defense was the loss of safety Antoine Bethea to a second-quarter shoulder injury.\nThe Seahawks went up 20-3 with 9:23 remaining when Steven Hauschka kicked his second field goal of the game, this from 46 yards. His second-quarter, 49-yard field goal marked the longest ever by a visiting kicker at Levi's Stadium.\n(c)2015 San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)\nVisit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742080&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742080", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742080&h=Seahawks+drub+49ers%2C+20%2D3"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:09:55.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
