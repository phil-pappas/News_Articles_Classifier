The Spartans ran longer drives of nine and 13 plays, ending in a one-yard rush by running back Delton Williams and an 11-yard touchdown reception by Aaron Burbridge.\nThe score at halftime was 21-20, after a missed extra point by kicker Griffin Oakes.\nCook and senior quarterback Nate Sudfeld traded passing touchdowns in the third quarter, Cook's to tight end Josiah Price and Sudfeld's to receiver Andre Booker, who recorded his first career touchdown reception.\nAfter another missed extra point, IU trailed Michigan State, 28-26, going into the fourth quarter.\nIU never found the Michigan State side of the field in the fourth quarter, as it was outscored, 24-0, ending its own drives in a punt, a turnover on downs, a fumble and the end of the game.\nThe Spartans defeated the Hoosiers with a final score of 52-26.\nSudfeld finished the game with 306 passing yards, three touchdown passes and one interception, while Cook finished with a career-high 398 yards,four touchdowns and no interceptions.\nTaylor Lehman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:52:25.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
