More than a million of them buy hunting licenses, and the state also sells more than a million fishing licenses each year. National surveys indicate that the majority of Americans (79 percent) support hunting, even if they don't personally participate.\nSeventeen states have passed similar amendments, but the right to hunt and fish issue was voted down in Arizona.\n\"We cannot be complacent on this issue,\" said Ben Carter, executive director of the Dallas Safari Club. \"Proposition 6 is an opportunity to protect the right to hunt and fish for future generations.\"\nOfficials discuss needs of monarch butterflies At the height of the monarch butterfly migration, state and national officials gathered at the George W.
