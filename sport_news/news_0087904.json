As of Friday, UNM was a 12½-point favorite to take its 70th victory in the series.\nA crowd of about 30,000 is expected.\nToday\nNew Mexico State at New Mexico, 6 p.m. ROOT Sports, 770 AM, 1240 AM and 93.7 FM in Albuquerque; 570 AM and 104.5 FM in Las Cruces Last year, NMSU came within a whisker of capturing its 32nd win over its upstate nemesis. A no-huddle tempo that UNM coach Bob Davie has described as “maniacal” gave the Lobos fits.\nThus far in 2015, the Aggies have seldom shown that frenetic tempo. Davie expects them to do so tonight, based on last year’s success.\nWhether or not that happens, the Lobos still will have to deal with the various components of the NMSU spread offense.\nTackling in space, a UNM weakness in recent years, will be at a premium.\n“What I remember (from last year) is them hitting a lot of now routes,” said Santos, the Lobos’ starting strong safety, “which is the receiver basically catching the ball at the line of scrimmage.”\nThose passes are one facet, Santos said, of the run-pass option executed by NMSU quarterback Tyler Rogers.\n“They have either the running back on the dive, the quarterback on the run, or, if he sees a defensive back come off their man, he’ll hit the receiver for, like, a lateral pass,” Santos said.\nThis year, Aggies head coach Doug Martin has assumed offensive coordinator duties after Gregg Brandon left. Martin seems a bit more intent on going downfield in the passing game and less on the quick sideline passes.\nRegardless, Santos said, it’s up to the secondary to make the tackle before serious damage is done.\nThat didn’t happen last year with any consistency – either against NMSU or other opponents.\n“We missed a bunch of tackles last year,” said Santos, one of the Lobos’ surer tacklers. “We were one of the worst defenses in the country, purely off missed tackles.\n“We’d have people in position; we just couldn’t bring them down, and yards after contact would just go up and up and up.”\nImprove tackling technique was the UNM defense’s No. 1 priority in preseason workouts. Through four games, the number of missed tackles has been reduced.\nBut whether the issue is tackling or coverage, Davie has been far from satisfied with his secondary, particularly at cornerback.\n“Nobody’s jumped up and proven they’re better than the other guy,” Davie said. “… And (the Aggies) will totally tax us. We’ll find out a lot more this week, how consistent we can play technique throughout an 80- or 90-play football game.”\nIf the Lobos can’t stop the Aggies on defense and simply have to match touchdowns, there’s plenty of evidence that they can. The UNM ground game has been almost unstoppable in this rivalry game the past three years, and the Aggies rank 125th of 127 NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision teams in total defense (576.7 yards allowed per game).\nDavie, however, wonders what new wrinkles the NMSU defense might present since the Aggies had an open date last week.\n“The open date is pretty significant, but we’re pretty much prepared for anything,” he said.\nIf the NMSU offense does go to its extreme tempo, Santos said, the Lobos’ experience against Tulsa should help.\nIt’s not as if UNM did well against Tulsa’s tempo, giving up 600 yards in a 40-21 loss Sept. 12. But, Santos said, the Lobos will be better prepared as a result.\n“At times (against NMSU last season) we were discombobulated and didn’t know what was going on. We couldn’t get the (defensive) call because of how fast they were going.\n“(But) we’ve already seen it with (Tulsa).”\nWell, OK, but that was then.\nWhat of the here and the now routes?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:54:04.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
