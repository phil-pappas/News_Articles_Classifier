I think all the drivers have always wanted less downforce on the cars. \n“I think there’s been some great tests this year as far as race conditions — Darlington, Kentucky — and I feel like we’ve seen a huge improvement in racing at those two race tracks. Darlington has been a race track in the past that’s been kind of a tough race track to see a great race and this year (was) one of the best races we’ve had all year. And the only thing different is the rules package and a softer tire to go along with it. Heck yeah, perfect. What else do you need to hear?” \nLogano, and others, said that the ’16 rules package is one that will benefit drivers in a variety of ways. \n“It’s a lot of fun for drivers,” Logano said about the effect of lower downforce. “It’s a lot easier to be behind another car and be able to race them and pass them and stuff like that, so that’s good. That’s the right direction. I’m not against going more someday, but this is a great step to see where it takes us next year. I think it will be a lot of fun to be a part of it.’’ \nDale Earnhardt Jr. agreed. \n“I think all the drivers are excited about it,’’ Earnhardt said. “I’m good with it. It’s a good change of direction I think to change the way the races are going to look and feel. I wouldn’t be looking for some dramatic change, but I think the drivers are happy about it. I believe that after what the fans and NASCAR saw in the two races that we ran it this year (Darlington, Kentucky) that they are excited about it was well.” \n“I think it’s going to put more in the driver’s hands, where cars drive better in traffic and worse by themselves,” Martin Truex Jr. said. “That’s really what we’re looking for. It should be good.” \nEARNHARDT LOOKING TO RALLY — A tough day at Charlotte last week, which resulted in a 28th-place finish, put Earnhardt in a hole heading into the final two races of the Challenger Round at Kansas Sunday and next week at Talladega. \nEarnhardt is currently 11th in the Chase standings and 19 points out of eighth, with the top eight after Talladega moving on to the Eliminator Round. \n“We ain’t got nothing to lose,’’ Earnhardt said. “We just go out there and run hard and try to win races and try to run up front. We are not close enough to the top eight to sort of have a strategy. \n“We are just going to go out there and race and see how it works out for us and try to win. We have two opportunities and we are a good enough teams so we will see how that works out.’’ \nEarnhardt will start 15th on Sunday. \nKESELOWSKI LOOKING FOR RACE-DAY CHANGES — Brad Keselowski, who is holding the eighth and final transfer spot for the Eliminator Round, earned the Hollywood Casino 400 pole on Friday and was the fastest car in Saturday morning’s first practice session. \nBut Keselowski not sure how all of that will factor in on Sunday, when the temperature is expected to be much warmer. \n“The track is changing,” he said. “Today it’s a lot cooler than it’s supposed to be tomorrow. We know the grooves and all of that is going to change, so we have some speed but we have to keep working on it because you’re going to see comers and goers as the track changes and we don’t want to be a goer. \n“We want to be one of those guys that comes to the front and stays in the front.’’ \nRick Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1129 or rick.peterson@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:55:12.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
