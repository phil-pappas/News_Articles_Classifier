A large portion of these visitors will be on the hunt for whitetail deer, prompting Forest Service managers to urge visitors to use extra caution. \n“During this time of year everyone should be mindful of the dangers that exist when safety precautions aren’t followed,” said Ouachita National Forest supervisor Norm Wagoner. “Like wearing hunter orange as your outermost gear so that you are visible to other hunters; being alert when hunting near developed areas and trails as non-hunters are enjoying the forest, and telling someone where you will be hunting and when you will return.” \nOzark-St. Francis National Forests supervisor Reggie Blackwell said everyone is responsible for his/her own safety, and should remember those around them. \n“We want people to have a great time while hunting in the forests, but it is important that they do so safely. A good place to start is by following all state and federal regulations, many of which are developed specifically for public safety,” Blackwell said. “And for those that aren’t hunting, safety is just as important. When you’re in the forest during black powder or rifle season, wear orange to distinguish yourself from wildlife and the hunter who might take an unsafe shot.” \nAll state wildlife regulations are in effect on national forests in the two states. State and federal law enforcement officers work with forest officials to reinforce rules relating to issues that occur year after year. These illegal activities include: \n• Baiting game species in the national forests \n• Shooting from or across a county, state or federally maintained road \n• Possessing or consuming alcohol during any hunting activity or while operating a motorized vehicle, including off-highway vehicles (OHVs). \nAdditionally, campsites may be in place for up to 30 days as long as they are occupied. At the end of the 30-day period, campsites must be completely dismantled and moved at least one mile from the original campsite. The 30-day period begins the first day any item is placed at the campsite. Campers may camp up to 90 days in a calendar year. Campsites may not be reserved. \nHunters should also be aware of additional legal requirements that apply only to the individual national forests. \nHunting stands may be erected for up to 14 days at a time and must be moved to another location more than 200 yards away if the hunting trip continues. All stands must have the owner’s name and address permanently affixed. Remove stands from the forest at the end of the hunting season. \nMotor Vehicle Use Maps (MVUMs) are available which show all designated routes for motorized travel. OHVs are allowed on designated routes only or in game retrieval corridors while retrieving legally downed game. Be aware that not all Forest Service roads are designated as routes. OHV operators may pick up a free map at the nearest Ouachita National Forest office or print one from the website ( www.fs.usda.gov/ouachita ) to ensure they are riding legally and are aware of game retrieval rules. For more information, consult hunting regulations published by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.
