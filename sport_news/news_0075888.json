(Bettina Hansen/The Seattle Times) Huskies have sold about 67,000 tickets for Saturday's game vs. the Ducks. By Adam Jude Seattle Times staff reporter \nSince the new $282-million Husky Stadium was unveiled at the start of the 2013 season, the Huskies have had just three sellouts in 18 home games. \nThe last sellout? That was in the Apple Cup in 2013, nearly two years ago. \nWashington coach Chris Petersen has seen new Husky Stadium packed to the rafters … but that was for the 2013 season opener, when Petersen was coaching Boise State on the opponent’s sideline. \nThe Huskies say they would love to see the stadium full when rival Oregon visits Saturday night (7:30 p.m., EPN2). As of Thursday morning, UW reported that a little under 67,000 tickets had been sold for the game.
