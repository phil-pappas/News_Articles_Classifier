Regardless of past indiscretions off the field, Michael Irvin is all-in on Greg Hardy. He wants the Dallas Cowboys to sign the pass-rusher “to a long-term deal right now.”\nAdChoices Speaking on 105.3 The Fan on Tuesday, Irvin gushed about Hardy’s on-field exploits and said the Cowboys would have won the Super Bowl last year if only Hardy had been on the field rushing the passer.\nTo his point, the dynamic defender did make a significant impact in his first game back after missing most of the 2014 season and the first four games this year. Hardy racked up two sacks, a forced fumble, four solo tackles and was on Tom Brady’s behind throughout the contest.\n“I know a lot of people are mad at this dude, but I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is the first game.’ To come back in the first game and do what that dude did, that was crazy,” Irvin said\nIn addition to Hardy’s legal case that was ultimately dismissed by a judge, Hardy’s image was further tarnished when a rap video from 2014 came out , via TMZ.com, before Sunday’s game.\nNone of that seems to bother Irvin, however.\n“I’m sorry everybody and I don’t want to be insensitive, but while everybody’s mad about the video, we should sign him to a long-term deal now,” Irvin said. “It was so impressive to see that, it was mind-boggling impressive.”\nIt’s a cold-hard football perspective from Irvin here, but in this day and age, fans expect more than just outstanding play on the field. Many fans these days want their heroes to actually be good people, on and off the field, rather than gladiators who simply live for the fight.\nTerry Bradshaw’s message Sunday resonated with the nation when he noted Hardy has never been contrite about any of his past indiscretions.\n“He has that attitude. It’s not just talk. It’s not just in front of a bunch of cameras. That’s what he is, and he is that way. He’s very aggressive out there. …\nThe NFL continues to welcome men like Hardy back into the fold because they are phenomenal players who can do things most mere mortals can only dream about. Irvin’s comments are a direct reflection of how the league views the entire situation.\nAnd yet, when a man like DeAngelo Williams wants to honor his late mother by wearing a splash of pink in his uniform, the league wags its finger and says, “no,” you must follow the rules.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://dfw.cbslocal.com/category/105-3-the-fan-shows/gavin-chris/", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/10/nfl-denies-deangelo-williams-request-to-wear-pink-all-season-to-honor-late-mother/", "http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/dallas-cowboys-terry-bradshaw-handling-of-greg-hardy-this-is-wrong-101115", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/10/greg-hardy-money-strippers-and-bottles-in-music-video-shot-during-suspension/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:48:11.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
