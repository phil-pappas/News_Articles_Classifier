(AP) - Some New Hampshire Democrats are protesting the Democratic National Committee's decision to hold just one debate in New Hampshire before the Feb. 9 presidential primary.\nA coalition of more than 80 Democrats and independents are forming \"New Hampshire Debates.\" The group plans to push back against the DNC schedule and try to organize another New Hampshire debate. DNC rules penalize candidates who participate in a non-sanctioned debate.\nThe group includes current and former elected officials, activists and local operatives. State Sen. Lou D'Allesandro is in the group, as is Peter Burling, a former DNC committeeman.\nThe group says the DNC schedule undermines the tradition of the New Hampshire primary.\nThe only debate in New Hampshire is scheduled for Dec. 19, the Saturday before Christmas.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:40:29.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
