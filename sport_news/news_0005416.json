We weren't sure when the shakeup would be, but the Pac-12 caused a ruckus in Week 8 of college football. \nArizona State (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) and Oregon (4-3, 2-2) took the week off. Here is how the rest of the conference managed to play. California (5-2, 2-2) at UCLA (5-2, 2-2) \nScore: UCLA 40, California 24 \nGame recap: The Bears never gave themselves a chance at the Rose Bowl. They allowed UCLA to score on all six of its first-half possessions. By halftime, the Bruins were well ahead and the game's outcome was predictable. \nKey stat: UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen completed 34 of 47 passes for 399 yards and three touchdowns. \nConference implication: Hello, Rosen. The freshman played lights out this week. Something in the air makes it seem like the South title showdown will come at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City Nov. 21. \nThe Bears started the season flawlessly, but the past couple games haven't been so. Hopes for the North title aren't lingering as Stanford is taking control. On the plus side, an appearance in the postseason is manageable. \nNext opponent: UCLA hosts Colorado; California hosts USC. Colorado (4-4, 1-3) at Oregon State (2-5, 0-4) \nScore: Colorado 17, Oregon State 13 \nGame recap: Both teams came into this game without a conference win and were determined to improve their record. It was a close game, walking into the locker rooms tied at the half, but the Buffaloes broke their 14-game losing streak in the Pac-12 with a win. \nKey stat: Colorado quarterback Sefo Liufau finished with 140 yards, completing 16 of 23 passes and a touchdown. He also rushed for 44 yards, adding another score. \nConference implications: Although this will likely be the only conference win for the Buffs, this victory is meaningful. It provides hope that the program is improving under head coach Mike MacIntyre. \nIt's a rebuilding season for the Beavers, and it shows. This game was their best chance for a conference win, but many injuries didn't help their cause. Quarterbacks Seth Collins and Nick Mitchell got playing time on the field, showing us that head coach Gary Andersen is still experimenting with his team. \nNext opponent: Colorado travels to UCLA; Oregon State travels to Utah. Utah (6-1, 3-1) at USC (4-3, 2-2) \nScore: USC 42, Utah 24 \nGame recap: Utah came into the Coliseum ranked No. 3 in the nation and left embarrassed by a blowout from an unranked team. The Utes' pulse flat-lined in the second quarter after quarterback Travis Wilson threw his first of four interceptions. From there, USC was the more physical team and got the last hoorah. \nKey stat: Trojans linebacker Cameron Smith intercepted Wilson three times. He finished with 122 return yards, including a 54-yard touchdown. \nConference implications: USC needed this win to stay relevant in the South division. Saturday's performance proved the Trojans are one of the most talented teams in the Pac-12. Hang on tight, because the South is up for grabs. \nUtah's run at an undefeated season has come to an end. It was expected the Utes wouldn't escape the Pac-12 without at least one loss. But how they lost is surprising. Head coach Kyle Whittingham's team is rarely out-muscled, yet it was a team led by an interim coach that did so. A favorable schedule remains for Utah, so the hope for a South title is still within reach. \nNext opponent: USC travels to California; Utah hosts Oregon State. Washington (3-4, 1-3) at Stanford (6-1, 5-0) \nScore: Stanford 31, Washington 14 \nGame recap: The Pac-12's best offense steamrolled over one of the conference's best defenses. Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan was efficient yet again, and running back Christian McCaffrey had yet another phenomenal game. It was all too much for the Huskies. \nKey stat: McCaffrey rushed for 109 yards and a touchdown. He also caught five passes for 112 yards for a score and added 79 more on kick returns. \nConference implications : This Stanford team is the real deal, exploding on the field every chance it gets. At this point, the Cardinal looks like the Pac-12 favorites. Next week, a visit to Pullman, Washington, to play the Cougars can affect how the North division pans out. \nWithout starting quarterback Jake Browning, Washington fell second to last in the division Saturday. They aren't playing for much this season, but the fact freshman running back Myles Gaskin had his third-straight 100-yard game is good news for the Huskies. \nNext opponent: Stanford travels to Washington State; Washington hosts Arizona. Washington State (5-2, 3-1) at Arizona (5-3, 2-3) \nScore: Washington State 45, Arizona 42 \nGame recap: Washington State quarterback Luke Falk and receiver Gabe Marks set the tone for this contest. The Wildcats snuck up behind the Cougars late in the game, but Falk was efficient and led his team to its third conference win. \nKey stat: Marks had a career night, catching eight passes for 97 yards and four touchdowns. \nConference implications: For the first time since 2003, the Cougars have won three-consecutive Pac-12 games. Next week they'll host North rival Stanford in a matchup that suddenly becomes significant, helping find the division leader. A pass-happy Washington State team also needs just one more win to become bowl eligible. \nThe defending South champs are getting further away from a repeat every week. Arizona has a tough schedule, considering it goes on the road for two-straight weeks, so fingers are crossed in Wildcats territory. \nNext opponent: Washington State hosts Stanford; Arizona travels to Washington.
