Dowell, Orlando Sentinel Stephen M. Dowell, Orlando Sentinel Brendan Sonnone Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel FSU starting LB Reggie Northrup was once a Miami commit. \nLinebacker Reggie Northrup committed to Miami back in June of 2011, stayed true to his word for about 200 days, and then flipped to FSU shortly before National Signing Day. \nFSU has won its last five games against Miami, meaning Northrup is a perfect 4-0 against the Hurricanes. He has no regrets. \n“At the time it was a business decision, things didn’t work out,” said Northrup, now a fifth-year senior for the Seminoles. “…It’s great I never lost to the team that I decommitted from. You don’t want that to happen, things to be rubbed in your face.” \nNorthrup was a third team All-ACC member in 2014 and is again playing a key role for the Seminoles in 2015, validating his choice to flip commitments. He will start against Miami, making him one of five FSU players who were once committed to the Hurricanes. \nWide receivers Travis Rudolph and Kermit Whitfield – both starters for FSU – pledged to Miami at one point. Reserve defensive tackle Keith Bryan and tight end Jeremy Kerr also were committed to the Hurricanes before flipping to FSU.

The sophomore has 424 rushing yards and four scores in four games, and will be a focal point for Miami as it looks to beat FSU for the first time since 2009. \nOf course, FSU neutralized the loss of Yearby in the same recruiting cycle when it landed his former teammate and running mate, Dalvin Cook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:22:41.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
