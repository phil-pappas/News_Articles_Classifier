Mayfield is an under-the-radar Heisman Trophy candidate with 1,520 total yards and 17 total touchdowns through four games as Oklahoma's starter.\nThe reduced role hasn't discouraged Knight, who spoke with newsok.com's Jason Kersey about being the backup quarterback.\n\"It's been enjoyable to watch Baker (Mayfield) go out there and play the way he has,\" Knight told Kersey. \"It's been enjoyable to be a leader still. It's been fun to take the things that we did wrong last year and the previous year since I've been here and mold this team into what we want it to be.\n\"Us older guys are molding this team slowly but surely into the team that we want to be. It's been an awesome ride.\"\nKnight stressed that he'd enjoy being the starting quarterback. However, he's going to stick with his current role to better the team.\n\"If everybody on this team embraces their role, we're gonna get to where we want to be at the end of the season,\" he said to newsok.com. \"That's the mindset you have to have. If you start pointing fingers or feeling sorry for yourself, you're never gonna be where you want to be as a team and as a leader.\"\nTwitter: @Josh_Friemel\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://newsok.com/article/5451652", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-07T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:51:11.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
