The decision to celebrate October 15 as 'Reading Day' was taken by state Education Minister Vinod Tawde soon after Kalam's death in July.\nIn a government resolution, the state has asked all schools to host book exhibitions and implement 'gift a book' programme.\nOn 'Vaachan Prerna Din' on Thursday, Tawde visited Zilla Parishad School No. 1 at Achole in Nalasopara. He inaugurated the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Vaachan Katta (reading hub) and gifted a book box to students.\nThe minister interacted with students and thereafter visited a 'Book Mobile' van with students.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:06:53.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
