They haven't lost 12 in a row since 1993. \n\"It doesn't even look like baseball right now as ugly as these games are,\" Reds manager Bryan Price said. \"We're behind early. We're not scoring runs. We're playing against teams that are excited to be in the postseason. We're just finishing out our year.\" \nDeSclafani retired the first eight batters he faced. Then 10 of the last 18 batters he faced reached, eight by hit and two by walk. DeSclafani went five-plus innings and allowed five runs on eight hits. He walked two and struck out eight. \nDeSclafani finishes the year 9-13 with a 4.05 ERA. He threw a career-high 184 1/3 innings. He threw 136 1/3 last year, plus 27 in the Arizona Fall League. \nHe faded in his last four starts, allowing 17 runs on 25 hits over 15 2/3 innings. That took his ERA from 3.67 to 4.05. \nPrice was pleased with DeSclafani's season. \n\"What am going to say about this kid?\" Price said. \"He's kind of been the saving grace for this staff. It certainly wasn't the type of game he wanted to have to finish the season. In the end, the kid topped 180 innings, he pitched all the way through. He made all his starts. And we think the world of this guy.\" \nDeSclafani was pleased with his season – well, except the end of it. \n\"I guess it was good season overall,\" DeSclafani said. \"I'm definitely disappointed the way I ended it. It's not the ending I had in mind. I had a couple of goals that I wanted to reach that I didn't reach. \n\"It's definitely going to leave a sour taste in my mouth going into the offseason . It's going to make me work harder.\" Joey Votto, Todd Frazier out of the lineup \nThe Reds got off to a good start for the first time in days. DeSclafani struck out the side in the first. It was the first time in four games that the Reds did not allow a run in the first inning. \nCenter fielder Tyler Holt singled in his first at-bat as a Red. Brandon Phillips followed with a blooper down the right-field line that dropped for a double. \nJay Bruce hit one to deep center for a sacrifice fly to give the Reds a 1-0 lead. It was their first lead in five games. \nIt lasted an inning. DeSclafani walked pitcher Jon Lester, a .051 hitter, with two outs in the third after getting ahead. Kyle Schwarber , the Middletown kid, singled. That made him 10-for-21 at Great American. \nAustin Jackson hit one to the wall in right-center to get both runners home and make it 2-1. \n\"I was feeling good up to the point (with Lester),\" DeSclafani said. \"I think I was trying to get a little greedy, going for the punch-out. Then I fall behind the guy, all the sudden I walk him. Things kind of spiraled there. I kind of hit a wall going into the next inning. I couldn't finish the game the way I wanted to.\" \nThe Cubs added one run in the third and one in the fourth to make it 4-1. \nStarlin Castro made it 5-1 in the sixth with his 11 th home run. \nThe Cubs turned it into a blowout in the eighth with three runs off Tony Cingrani . Cingrani has allowed seven runs over 4 1/3 innings in his last five appearances. \nLester got on a roll after the first. After Brayan Pena's double with one out in the second, Lester retired the final 20 batters he faced. \n\"You've got to compete better than we competed here in September,\" Price said. \"It's been miserable to watch. I'm sure the players feel the same way I do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:48:04.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
