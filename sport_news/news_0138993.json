I could tell the kids recognized that,\" he said.\nSince the choir's rendition of the hymn was posted on the group's YouTube channel the day after the shooting, the clip has been viewed more than 11,000 times.\nGingerich said he's glad the video has been well-received but prefers the focus to remain on the victims.\n-- Jessica Greif\njgreif@oregonian.com\n@JessicaDGreif", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jessicadgreif", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNqQTtiwEp4"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:13:34.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
