Consolidated have invested more than $150,000 in the recycling program, which includes a direct mail educational packet to be sent to all single-family households in Metro Louisville the week of Oct. 16.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nLouisville gets sustainability recognition\nThe educational packet will contain an official “Give It Back” sticker, along with images highlighting which materials should go in the recycling container.\nResidents must place the “Give It Back” sticker on one of their recycling containers to be eligible for a chance to win a $50 Kroger gift card. Additional packets and stickers will be available at Kroger stores throughout Louisville.\nRepresentatives of a \"recycling patrol\" will begin visiting area residences later this month, in an effort to “catch” households that are recycling properly. A total of 270 of those households will receive $50 Kroger gift cards over the next six months.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aff009cb08c5a862515d21379183dee58818b371/c=0-936-3744-4680/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/10/08/516488003.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:05:32.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
