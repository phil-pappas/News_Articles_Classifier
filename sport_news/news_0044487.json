Last place in Metropolitan Division. No playoffs. \nCOACH: Bill Peters, second season, 30-41-11. \nADDED: G Eddie Lack, RW Kris Versteeg, D James Wisniewski. \nLOST: RW Alexander Semin, G Anton Khudobin. \nPLAYER TO WATCH: C Eric Staal. The 30-year-old captain and current face of the franchise is entering the final season of a seven-year contract he signed in 2008. He has led the team in scoring in seven of his 10 seasons - including last year, when he had 23 goals and 54 points - but carries the weight of the team’s lengthy postseason drought on his 6-foot-4 frame. \nOUTLOOK: No team in the Eastern Conference has gone longer since its last playoff appearance than Carolina, which last made the postseason in 2009. The returning players have a stronger grasp of Peters’ detail-oriented system and the addition of Lack should strengthen the team’s situation in goal. But an infusion of young players likely means a few more growing pains for a franchise celebrating the 10th anniversary of its lone Stanley Cup title this season. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:37:30.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
