We had many opportunities, at least four good chances to score, but we could not score. But in the end we drew so we could reach our goal to get to the final,” said Guangzhou’s Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. \n“We had at least four opportunities to score compared to Gamba who are a very strong team who only had two opportunities to score, so in the end we had more opportunities to score and if we had scored, the match would have been different.” \nAl Ahli, which reached the final on Tuesday after a dramatic 4-3 aggregate victory over Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia 4-3, will host the first leg in Dubai on November 7 with the return game in southern China on November 21. \nEvergrande, winner in 2013 when it beat South Korean side FC Seoul on away goals in the final, led the semifinal 2-1 after a second-half header by captain Zheng Zhi from the first leg in Guangzhou three weeks ago. \nElkeson tried to build on the advantage, but his right-footed effort in the 43rd minute forced a smart save from goalkeeper Masaaki Higashiguchi. \nThe Brazilian had another great opportunity to break the deadlock minutes into the second half when he was released in the left by Ricardo Goulart’s excellent through ball but scooped his effort just over the crossbar. \nGamba had avoided elimination with three comeback wins during its run to the semifinals but it struggled to find a way past the Evergrande defence during the opening hour. It went close to a breakthrough in the 57th minute when Shu Kurata’s cut-back from the right was punched away by goalkeeper Zeng Cheng before it could reach a lurking Patric. \nGamba displayed greater urgency after Japan striker Takashi Usami replaced Hiroyki Abe on the hour. \nKurata saw his effort on a quick counter blocked by a defender while Usami fired a low shot narrowly wide of the right post with six minutes left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:20:28.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
