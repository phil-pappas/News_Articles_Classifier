In his unyielding effort to be perceived as a college sports visionary, Pac-12 Conference commissioner Larry Scott has identified a solution in search of a problem.\nAdChoices This week, he advocated for shifting the college basketball season to start a month later, so that it would be contained as a “one-semester sport.”\nMORE: Don't expect a shift anytime soon\nAccording to ESPN’s Myron Medcalf , Scott told those gathered at Pac-12 Media Day this suggestion would help college basketball because the “overlap can be a challenge” — the overlap referencing November activity in the NBA, NFL, NFL, college football and, so he says, the Major League Baseball playoffs.\nA 2015 World Series Game 7 would be Wednesday, Nov. 4.\nThe first college basketball game of the 2015-16 season is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 13.\nBut as Boon said to Otter, “Forget it, he’s rolling.”\nThe supposed problem with college basketball starting in mid-November is that early season games are lost in the supposed crush of attention given during that period to college football. This is complete and utter nonsense. By Dec. 5, three weekends into college basketball, the college football season is down to seven scheduled games plus a few conference championship games. The overlap barely exists.\nFor this, Scott wants to forfeit college basketball’s ownership of a month – March – that is worth $771 million to the NCAA before anyone even has sold a ticket (or a hot dog, or a corporate hospitality event, or a sponsorship). And Scott would gamble that the NCAA Tournament could sustain that value against competition from the NBA playoffs, the Stanley Cup playoffs, the start of the Major League Baseball season and spring weather.\nMORE: Final Four records that will never be broken\nFor what, exactly?\nProblems attracting viewers to early college basketball games? Is that the issue? Are we sure about that? Because it’s not a problem at Kansas (drew 16,300 last season for Rider) or Kentucky (22,175 for Buffalo) or Arizona (14,655 for Northridge). It is not a problem in places that care deeply about college basketball in general and are eager to watch their beloved teams develop against whatever competition they face.\nIt is a problem in places that are not as connected to college hoops. Here’s the catch: Moving games to December is not going to change that. The only way to even have a chance it is to dramatically change the product.\nThat would require more teams playing more competitive games and playing more of them on campus. You’re not going to get Texas fans to show up in great numbers for Appalachian State whether that game is played in November, December or June. And when the Horns do play a game this season their fans would do anything to see, against latent rival Texas A&M, it will occur 1,300 miles from Austin in the Bahamas.\nMORE: The latest on Lamar Odom's condition\nSo many of the most appealing college basketball games are outsourced to neutral courts because coaches construct the majority of schedules and find non-league road games undesirable.\nThere is a reason for that: They’re hard. They’re hard to play, hard to win, hard to survive. There’s a value for high-major teams to play mid-majors. I covered a Pitt team in 1991-92 – Arizona coach Sean Miller was its point guard — that played 27 of its 32 regular-season games against major opponents. By the time the Big East season was over, that group was finished.\nBut it’s also hard to sell tickets in many places — especially upper-deck tickets with compromised views far below the standard provided by one’s 55-inch high-def flat screen— to games that figure not to be events.\nThat is college basketball’s reality. Shifting the schedule would not change it. It would, instead, damage the sport’s greatest asset: March Madness.\nRemember “New Coke?”\nThat’s what Larry Scott is selling here.\nAnd if you don’t remember “New Coke,” well, isn’t that even worse?\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8lT1o0sDwI", "http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1913612_1913610,00.html", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2015-10-16/lamar-odom-hospital-updates-condition-jim-harrick-khloe-kardashian-las-vegas", "http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13895102/pac-12-commish-larry-scott-says-consider-containing-college-basketball-season-single-semester", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2015-10-15/march-madness-college-basketball-season-change-football-start-date", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4635274-final-four-records-that-will-never-be-broken-photos-bill-bradley-bill-walton-bill-russell-freddie-banks", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:09:17.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
