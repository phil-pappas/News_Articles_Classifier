(Photo: COURTESY PHOTO) \nEverybody else in Western North Carolina had a \"regular\" season by comparison. \nChrist School soccer (13-0-4) and West Henderson volleyball (21-0) put a bow on undefeated regular seasons with wins on Tuesday. \nThe playoffs for both teams start Saturday. \nCarolinas Athletic Association player of the year Young Perry (10 goals), Cal Jansen (14 goals, six assists), Riley Smith (seven goals) and Hunter Vines (five assists) have carried to the Greenies to what is believed to be their first-ever undefeated regular season. Will Iorio has posted seven shutouts and is only allowing an average of 0.76 goals per game. \nIorio, Jansen and Devon Johnson are All-CAA selections along with Perry. \nChrist School jumped out to a 5-1 lead Tuesday at home and then held on to nip Rabun Gap (Ga.), 5-4. \nJansen (two), Johnson, Vines, and Perry were the goal-scorers and Iorio made four saves. Not only that, the Greenies won both of their head-to-head meetings with CAA runner-up Asheville Christian Academy by identical 3-0 scores. That included Saturday's game in the Swannanoa Valley that clinched the conference championship. \n\"Our guys have finally started playing a full game,\" Christ School coach Guy Campbell said. \n\"We were more of a second-half team early on, but they've turned things around. We've had a number of guys who have been consistent for us all year and they've carried us. But there are some other guys who have started to play at a high level, too, in recent weeks like Riley Smith and Wade Mouer. And that's probably the biggest difference.\" \nCampbell is a 2000 Greenies graduate and no one presently with the athletic department can recall another Christ School soccer team that didn't lose a regular-season game. \nThe West Henderson volleyball team completed a 21-0 record season on Tuesday. (Photo: BILL RHODES) \nWest Henderson volleyball has only dropped one set (in a match with North Henderson on Sept. 29) en route to its first undefeated regular season since 2008. The Falcons handled their business again Tuesday with a 3-0 sweep (25-17, 25-18 and 25-16) at East Henderson. \n\"I feel good about this team. We're just ready to focus on what we need to do,\" West Henderson coach Tiffany Lowrance said. \n\"I'm so excited for these girls. They want (a NCHSAA 3-A championship) bad.\" \nMary Catherine Ball (224), Gracie Carrick (193), Destynee Galloway (156) and Taylor Houck (108) have all made 100 or more kills for the Western North Carolina Athletic Conference champs. Sierra Jones is far and away their leader in assists (628), while Isabella Perron (228), Galloway (220), Houck (122), Ball and Kasey West (113) lead the way in digs. \nCarrick has made 49 blocks, followed by Houck (38) and Sarah Anne Vidak (35). Aces have mostly come from the services of Galloway (35), Houck (34), Jones (32) and Perron (26). \n\"By all means, all our sets haven't been perfect,\" Lowrance said. \n\"We've had to fight through some of them and we've had to call a timeout, take a breath and get back in gear just like everybody else. We're just going to try and stay focused now, one match at a time. Any team can back down when (it faces a challenge) and we don't want to be that team.\" \nThe Falcons should have homecourt advantage throughout the state playoffs. They lost in the 2014 NCHSAA 3-A finals to Cardinal Gibbons, a Raleigh private-school program which has since moved up to 4-A. \n- Follow the HS Huddle on Facebook: www.facebook.com/hshuddle or Twitter: www.twitter.com/acthshuddle Read or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1RWnZKb Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:36:53.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
