Murphy has homered in six straight playoff games. By Tom Haudricourt of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 21, 2015 11:53 p.m. \nChicago — For those Chicago Cubs fans who actually believed their historically frustrating club might pull off a miracle comeback, they had plenty of time to get used to the idea that it wasn't going to happen. \nThat's how it goes when your team is down by six runs in the second inning. \nThe New York Mets, who never had swept a four-game series in the postseason, did so convincingly Wednesday night at Wrigley Field by squashing Chicago, 8-3, in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. \nWhile the Mets advanced to their first World Series since 2000, the Cubs were left with the consolation prize of knowing they arrived on this stage a year before anticipated and knocked off Pittsburgh and St. Louis before bowing out. It will take time for that to sink in because they simply were no match for New York's impressive stable of young pitchers. \nAfter waiting 70 years to get back to the Fall Classic, Chicago will have to wait at least one more. \n\"I salute the Mets,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \"That was a pretty impressive four games they played against us. \n\"Our team accomplished a lot this year. Of course, we wanted to go farther but you have to look at the positives. I want them to understand and embrace all they have done this year, how far we have come. We want to build on this season.\" \nThe Cubs swept the regular-season series from the Mets, seven games to none, but this was a different New York team entering the postseason. The talk of controlling innings stopped as the young stud rotation dominated and an offense that picked up considerably in the second half kept cranking. \nChicago's young, dynamic lineup was no match for the Mets' young, electric pitching staff, scoring only six runs in the four games. The Cubs never had a lead in the 36 innings played and batted only .164, the lowest team average ever for an NLCS. \nMets first baseman Lucas Duda, previously missing in action this postseason, finally awakened with a homer, double and five runs batted in, all coming in the first two innings. But, in keeping with the previous script, he had to share the glory with the home-run machine known as Daniel Murphy, who did it again. \n\"It's very exciting,\" said Mets manager Terry Collins, a baseball lifer who had yearned for this moment. \"I'm so happy for the job we did. There were some tremendous peaks and tremendous valleys. This might be the finest group of guys I've ever been around. \n\"After all these years, I can't believe I'm going to the World Series. It's a special moment for me. I told the players we had to grind it out. We're going to go home and enjoy it.\" \nThe Cubs and their fans wanted to believe they could match the miracle comeback of the 2004 Boston Red Sox, but the air was taken out of that balloon immediately. Continuing their trend of scoring early in the series, the Mets put four runs on the board in the first inning against Jason Hammel, who always looks like Superman against the Milwaukee Brewers (8-0 for his career). \nThe inning turned on a 2-2 pitch to Yoenis Cespedes that Hammel and the home faithful thought was strike three but was called correctly outside by umpire Paul Emmel. Cespedes then drew a walk, putting two on with two out and bringing Duda to the plate. The big power hitter was having a miserable postseason with three hits in 24 at-bats (.125), no homers and one RBI. \nBut very little went right for the Cubs in this series and that trend continued when Duda crushed a 3-2 pitch far over the wall in center. As the home crowd went silent, Travis d'Arnaud added a punctuation mark with an opposite-field homer that put the Mets up 4-0. \nAs if that deficit weren't bad enough, Duda stretched it to 6-0 in the second inning with a two-run double, managing to get a ball through the Cubs' infield shift that rolled all the way into the gap in right-center. So, a player who had only one five-RBI game all season matched that output in two at-bats and Wrigley was quieter than a prayer service. \nThe Cubs had their chance to get back in the game in the fourth when lefty Steven Matz, who had pitched hitless ball to that point, encountered a bases-loaded, no-out jam. The traffic jam occurred when Jorge Soler became the first Chicago hitter to get on base leading off an inning in the series with a double, followed by Kris Bryant's walk and a single to center by Anthony Rizzo. \nIn keeping with the way things went for the Cubs in this series, Starlin Castro lined a wicked shot that Wright snared with a leaping, outstretched grab to rob what could have been a bases-clearing double. That play took the starch out of the rally, limiting Chicago to one run on Kyle Schwarber's grounder to first base. \nThe only remaining mystery was whether Murphy would hit another home run and become the first player to go deep in six consecutive postseason games (seven overall). He didn't disappoint, crushing one to center in the eighth inning off Fernando Rodney go to complete an offensive smorgasbord that included two singles and a double. \n\"This is very special,\" said Murphy, an easy winner of the NLCS MVP award. \"I can't explain it. It's surprising to me. \n\"It's such a blessing to be able to contribute to what we do. I'm excited to do something to help us win some big games. This means so much to all of us.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved. About Tom Haudricourt \nTom Haudricourt covers the Brewers and Major League Baseball.
