I don't need to take any particular risks. There are four races left so it is not do-or-die this weekend.\" \nTwenty hours later than billed, qualifying started at 0900 on Sunday even though it was difficult to see how conditions had greatly improved. \nIndeed the torrential rain, which has battered the Texas region since Friday, worsened throughout the one-hour session and the top-10 shootout to determine the grid was eventually abandoned. \nThe times from Q2 were taken to determine the grid with Rosberg on pole ahead of Hamilton and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in third. Vettel qualified fifth but the Ferrari driver will be demoted 10 further places after an engine change. \nIt appears Hamilton's only rival to him winning a third championship in America is Rosberg. \n\"It was supposed to be drying out but it does not look like it out there so who knows?\" said Rosberg, who started here on pole last year but was overtaken by Hamilton during the race. \n\"I feel good in any condition at the moment and our car is great in any condition so whatever it is it will be fine.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:23:46.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
