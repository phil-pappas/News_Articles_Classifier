They are 15th in the standings with 11 points. \nMauro Zarate put the Hammers ahead after 17 minutes and Gary Cahill equalised for Chelsea after 56 minutes before substitute Andy Carroll won it for the hosts with a 79th-minute header. \n“We’ve had some great wins but that’s got to be one of the best. It was a great strike by Mauro Zarate for the opener. We went for the win and kept on pushing and got it,” Carroll told the BBC. \nCahill told Sky: “We were frustrated when Cesc’s goal was disallowed and when Matic got sent off. \n“That’s the way the season is going at the moment and we had one that nearly went over the line.
