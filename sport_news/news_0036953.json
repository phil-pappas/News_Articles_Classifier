John Marks jmarks@lakewyliepilot.com 1 of 3 LAKE WYLIE \nThere’s only so much educators can teach students from the school roof. \n“It’s keeping a promise,” said Georgia Westmoreland, primary principal at Crowders Creek Elementary School. “That’s what we’re teaching them.” \nWestmoreland joined Lori Maczko, elementary principal at the school, for several trips to the roof Oct. 8 to make good on a fundraising promise. They went up for arrival. They returned for recess. They returned for dismissal. Lake Wylie, SC, principals spend a day on the hot roof Crowders Creek Elementary School principals in Lake Wylie, SC, fulfilled a fundraising goal promise to students on Oct. 9 by spending a day working from the school's roof. The students collected pledges from all 50 states. Money will go to instructional supplies and a new multimedia room sound system. Video created and edited by John Marks \n“We came down because we did want to get some work done,” Westmoreland said. “Plus, it gets hot up there.” \nAdministrators said if students collected pledges from all 50 states during a recent Boosterthon fundraiser, Westmoreland and Maczko would work from above. They planned to do it a week earlier but heavy rain delayed them. \nThey didn’t get much work done up there but they spent the recess hours leading student in popular dances, accompanied by metal whistles. \n“It’s all in good fun,” Maczko said. \nRousing school spirit is part of the job for principals, even if methods aren’t exactly part of administration training. Principals have been known to dress oddly as incentives, embarrass themselves, even getting taped to walls. \n“We did that last year,” Westmoreland said. \nThursday was about the people on top of the building, but more important, the additions coming inside it. The pledges will be used for instructional supplies and a new sound system for the multipurpose room. \n“All of the money that is raised goes right back into our school,” Maczko said. \nJess Parker, who works in maintenance at the school, climbs the wall-mounted, metal ladder up to the roof at least once a week. \n“I get a lot of balls down,” he said. \nParker is more used to retrieving kickballs than he is principals, but he wasn’t surprised when they asked to venture up the ladder. \n“It’s amazing what they’ll do for these kids,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:13:47.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
