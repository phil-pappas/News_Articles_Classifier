Danks gave up six runs on 11 hits and three walks over five innings in the White Sox's 6-4 loss to the Royals.\nAt the plate\nWith a two-run single in the seventh, Jose Abreu joined Albert Pujols as the only major leaguers to record 30-plus homers and 100-plus RBIs in their first two seasons.\nTurning point\nMike Moustakas recorded his second run-scoring hit of the night and Jonny Gomes hit a two-run single to fuel the Royals' three-run third.\nIn the field\nThe game started poorly for the Sox when Alcides Escobar singled and advanced to second on catcher Tyler Flowers' throwing error to first. Escobar then scored the opening run.\nKey number\n4.71 — Danks' ERA this season over 177 2/3 innings.\nThe Quote:\n\"I tried to not think about it, but I couldn't do it because it was something that was in my head. Because I like the stats, it's something that I was always thinking about.\" — Abreu, through a team interpreter, on matching Pujols' feat\nThe Quote: II\n\"I was at a pretty low spot going into the All-Star break. First half, I felt like nothing really went right, and it was a little discouraging. I had two directions to go, I guess, at that point. The second half was better. I think I can still improve on that, but definitely feel good going into next year.\" — Danks on his season\nUp next\nVs.
