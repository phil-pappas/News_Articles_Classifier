And making a big play or two. \nSullivan made one. But Helias made one more as the Crusaders scored two touchdowns in the third quarter and defeated the Eagles 14-7. \n“It was a great game for our defense and our offense scored enough points to win it,” Helias coach Tim Rulo said. \nThe teams combined for just 107 total yards in the first half — 48 for Helias, 59 for Sullivan. \nSullivan eclipsed its total on its first play from scrimmage in the third quarter when Troy Creek scored on a 70-yard run. The PAT made it 7-0. \nHelias answered, going 65 yards on the next series. The score came on a 15-yard pass from Chandler Luebbert to Jacob Storms in the back of the end zone. The 2-point try failed and it was 7-6 in favor of Sullivan. \nHelias got what proved to be the game-winner in the final minute of the third quarter. \nNash Harvey’s punt pinned Sullivan back at its own 1 and an ensuing punt by the Eagles went for just 14 yards as Helias took over at the 19. \nSeven plays later, Jake Burnett bowled into the end zone on a fourth-and-goal play from the 2. Nolan Sachse ran for the 2-point conversion and Helias led 14-7 with :38 left in the third quarter. \nSullivan had the ball three more times in an attempt to tie it the remainder of the contest, but could not score. \nHelias finished with 188 total yards, 151 on the ground. Storms led with 88 rushing yards, while Kaleb Davis has 72. \nSullivan had 165 total yards, including just 6 through the air. Creek finished with 115 yards on eight carries for Sullivan (5-4). \nHelias (3-6) will start Class 4 District 7 play next week. The Crusaders will host Wentzville: Liberty on Saturday afternoon. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:14:36.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
