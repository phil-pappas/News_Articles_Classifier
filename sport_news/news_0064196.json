Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh, who is in-charge of the party's Punjab affairs, said apart from meeting families of people dead in the violence, Kejriwal will also pay obeisance at the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of Sikh religion. Kejriwal's visit assumes significance as the AAP is eyeing the 2017 Assembly poll in the state and has re-structured its unit there. The state gave four MPs to the party in the Lok Sabha election, of which two were recently suspended for \"anti-party\" activities. \"Tomorrow Arvind Kejriwal will visit Shri Harmandir Sahib, and later Kotkapura, to meet families of people died in violence,\" Durgesh Pathak, AAP's Punjab co-convener, said. After being on the boil for about a week over sacrilege incidents and police firing, Punjab was peaceful yesterday, even though some places witnessed tension and para-military forces conducted flag marches in various parts of the state. AAP's Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and urged him to ensure peace in the state. Mann conveyed Singh that the situation in Punjab was \"very disturbing\" in the wake of recent untoward incidents. Ten companies of para-military forces and the Punjab Police personnel are keeping a tight vigil in the wake of protests by Sikh organisations and hardliners in various parts of the state, including Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Jalandhar and Fardikot, the police said. Sikh organisations, not satisfied with the government's measures, announced setting up of a 'People's Commission' to probe sacrilege incidents, police firing in Faridkot's Behbal Kalan village, where two persons were killed, and alleged police excesses on Sikhs in the state. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:41:58.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
