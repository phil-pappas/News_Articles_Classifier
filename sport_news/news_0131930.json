Thirty-three dealers are part of the Fighting Illini Wheels program, The (Champaign) News-Gazette reported (http://bit.ly/1LJwOYR). Athletics officials can drive the cars for personal and business use but have to pay for gas and maintenance. The athletics department pays for insurance and registration and the benefit is taxable. Men’s basketball coach John Groce drives a 2015 BMW X5 worth more than $68,000. Athletic Director Mike Thomas has a 2014 Hyundai Equus worth $55,000. Interim football coach Bill Cubit has a 2014 Chevrolet Traverse worth about $22,600. “It’s a perk of the position,” athletics department spokesman Kent Brown said. “It’s a benefit for staff members who do a lot of driving. It gives dealers the ability to support the program in a unique way.” By The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:10:51.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
