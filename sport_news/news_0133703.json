(Photo/Chris Knight) \nCedar Crest (1-1 Section One, 2-3 overall) at Manheim Township (2-0 Section One, 4-1 overall): The Blue Streaks are on a red-hot streak, outscoring opponents the last three weeks by an average score of 47-17. \nErik Benjamin has thrown for 16 TDs against just 2 interceptions and owns a QB rating of 127. Matt Van Gorden paces the ground game while receivers John Stutz, Riley MacDonald and Dillon Oâ€™Connor have combined for 49 catches. \nMacDonald and Stutz are among the key contributors on the Township defense as well. MacDonald has a team-high 2.5 sacks and Stutz a team-leading 3 interceptions. Tackle leaders Grayson Sallade and Hogan Glick have combined for 65 stops. \nQB Steve Roda helps fuel the Falcon offense, as does Justice Belleman, who ranks as one of the top rushers in Section One. \nCrest's defense, which ranks among the best statistically in Section One, looks to provide a test for a Township attack that is among the best in the L-L. \nThe Streaks have been dominant in the series, posting four shutouts over the last decade.
