The Cavs won the East last year despite missing Kevin Love for most of the playoffs and then-starter Anderson Varejao for nearly all of the season.\nAdChoices The Cavs already have been saddled with injury concerns: Starting guards Kyrie Irving and Iman Shumpert could be out for months. But they still have LeBron James. And while the East competition made improvements and got healthier this offseason, it's not like Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis or James Harden moved.\nTOP 15: Point guards | Shooting guards | Small forwards | Power forwards | Centers\nYes, the East has been the weaker of the two NBA conferences for more than a decade, with a sub-.500 team making the playoffs in every 82-game season since 2009-10. James’ team has won the conference the last five years (four with the Heat) and he has participated in six of the last seven East finals.\nJames and the Cavaliers, barring a rash of injuries worse than last season's, look primed to return to the NBA's final four again. On paper, there's no great candidate to supplant Cleveland. But the games aren’t played on paper, so let's outline the Cavs' strengths and see what it would take for the next-best four teams in the conference to win it all.\nMORE NBA: Grading every team's offseason | Kobe and 8 others under pressure this year\nCleveland Cavaliers\n© Provided by Sporting News\nLast season: 53-29, 35-17 against the East\nThe Cavaliers are the favorites. The gap between them at full health and the rest of the conference is larger than it was last season. Irving believes the Cavs would have beaten the Warriors in the Finals had they been fully healthy, and his point has some merit given how well Cleveland played in the second half. Then again, no Love and Irving means the best player in the world had the ball in his hands more, but that’s neither here nor there.\nWhat matters is that the team didn’t lose any pieces while gaining former Cavalier Mo Williams to give them a boost off the bench and in the starting lineup while Irving heals from knee surgery.\nAnderson Varejao also returns to the floor after missing most of the 2014-15 season, the injury that triggered the key addition via trade of Timofey Mozgov last winter.Now the Cavs have four starting-caliber big men and more frontcourt depth than any team James has ever played on. The team will also need Tristan Thompson-like rebounding to dominate the East, but Love and Mozgov should be up to the task.\nIf they can’t win a ring this year, there might some concern because of Thompson’s contract situation . But with a healthy Varejao, Love, Thompson, Shumpert and most of all, Irving, James should lead them to another championship appearance. And unless the Warriors perfectly replicate last season , LaMarcus Aldridge immediately clicks in San Antonio or the Clippers make sense of all their roster moves , Cleveland could be looking at its first pro sports championship in 50 years.\nMORE CAVS: LeBron helps adults get GEDs\nChicago Bulls\n© Provided by Sporting News\nLast season: 50-32, 3-7 vs. Cavaliers (including playoffs).\nThe Bulls ran into the buzzsaw that was James and the Cavs during the 2014-15 East semifinals. Emphasis on the “LeBron” part. His teams have now bounced the Bulls from the playoffs four out of the last six years. And if the Bulls couldn’t beat the Cavs last year with Love out and Irving playing hurt, something big needs to happen or they ain't beating them now.\nChicago’s frontcourt was an advantage over Cleveland, but the return of Love and Varejao washed away much of that edge. Another good wing scorer or Derrick Rose returning to MVP form could push this team to win the East. Even if they just maintain last season's roster, they still may have the best shot at beating the Cavs because they have the deepest team combined with four All-Stars in the expected starting five.\nPHOTOS: All-time greatest Chicago Bulls\nThe Bulls were the only other East team to have two players rank in the top 20 in win shares per 48 minutes. Plus, Rose should improve on a below-average regular season after a strong playoff performance. In case Rose's improvements are mild, Nikola Mirotic needs to be the extra scorer for Chicago to defeat Cleveland.\nHe is a sleeper for Sixth Man of the Year if he doesn’t find his way into the starting lineup. The Spaniard averaged 16 points in 27 minutes over the final two months of the season. Drafting rookie Bobby Portis increases the depth of the bench, allowing Mirotic to play the three if he can guard the position well enough. Portis also makes Taj Gibson or Joakim Noah expendable.\nNew coach Fred Hoiberg will be the key to the Bulls beating the Cavs. He's expected to be a better offensive coach than Tom Thibodeau, but he needs to maintain some semblance of Thibs’ top flight defense (five years in Chicago, five years as a top-10 scoring defense). If Hoiberg can continue that trend and gets a little more from Rose and Noah, the Bulls will give Cleveland trouble.\nMORE BULLS: Jimmy Butler inspired by Mark Wahlber g\nMiami Heat\n© Provided by Sporting News\nLast season: 37-45 (missed playoffs), 2-2 vs. Cavaliers\nThe number three slot was the hardest judge. So why put a Heat team that missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007-08 here? It’s simple: the talent on this roster. The Heat played good defense in 2014-15 (held opponents to 97.3 PPG), but lacked on the other side of the ball (scored 94.7 PPG). That should all change.\nIf the Heat can keep All-Star caliber players Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Luol Deng and Goran Dragic healthy to go along with breakout Hassan Whiteside, this should be the most talented starting five in the conference outside of Cleveland.\nPHOTOS: All-time greatest Miami Heat players\nNot to mention, there’s a chance Whiteside can be improve in a starter’s role after he averaged a double-double in 48 games last year. His rim protection against LeBron James and his work on the boards against Tristan Thompson will be essential if the Heat want its fifth conference title of the decade — and first without James on the roster since 2006.\nHeat president Pat Riley brought in Amar’e Stoudemire and Gerald Green, while losing Shabazz Napier and Michael Beasley. Green will be vital against Cleveland. Neither team has great depth so Green needs to offset J.R. Smith and Mo Williams. Josh McRoberts, who played just 17 games last year after tearing his meniscus, and Stoudemire will have their hands full with Thompson and Anderson Varejao in bench matchups, but they can challenge the Cavs' frontcourt.\nFor the Heat to beat the Cavs it really comes down to the combination of Wade and Dragic. Wade is still a top-20 scorer in the league and Dragic is a versatile, crafty scorer who works better with the ball in his hands. The Heat were a subpar 11-13 last season with both in the lineup. If those two can play together while keeping Bosh involved, this team can compete with anyone.\nMORE: Can young Heat players keep Miami relevant post-Wade?\nAtlanta Hawks\n© Provided by Sporting News\nLast season: 60-22, 3-5 vs. Cavaliers (including playoffs).\nLast year's No. 1 seed was a top-10 squad in defensive and offensive efficiency, one of four teams have that distinction. However, when the Hawks met the Cavs in the Eastern Conference Finals, they were dominated and swept — only one game was closer than 8 points.\nBut rest easy Hawks fans, your streak of eight consecutive seasons with a playoff appearance (the longest in the East) is not in peril. Your chances of hosting a playoff series is a little less certain, but even that shouldn't be an issue if the Hawks stay healthy. The problem seems to be that the Hawks did little to put themselves in better position for another matchup with Cleveland.\nMORE: Offseason grades for all 30 NBA teams\nIn the 2014-15 regular season, Atlanta was fifth of 32 teams in opponents scoring, but sixth of 16 playoff teams in the postseason. While that difference doesn’t sound like much, ATL needs to be stronger in postseason instead of leveling off or getting worse. The team’s points per game fell in the postseason and its field goal percentage (fourth in regular season; ninth in postseason) and three-point shooting (went from second to 11th) also regressed.\nAtlanta lost DeMarre Carroll, a solid scorer who was their top perimeter defender. The addition of Tim Hardaway Jr. could offset Carroll's exit if he can start to hit on his scoring potential and is engaged on D (he had an ugly negative-4.2 defensive box plus/minus last season). Coach Mike Budenholzer will require better defense from Hardaway for playing time. The addition of Tiago Splitter helps a team that had the fourth-worst rebound differential in the postseason. Rebounding was a huge advantage in last season's ATL-CLE series, as the Hawks were outrebounded by 51 in four games. Splitter helps their undersized interior defense, too.\nAtlanta is coming off its best season in franchise history, but needs to improve while keeping everyone healthy to win the East. Beating the Cavs is a longshot, even compared to the Heat and Bulls. But Atlanta has the best coach in the East, so with some better postseason scoring from Al Horford (14.4 postseason PPG) and Kyle Korver (11.1 PPG) anything could happen.\nMORE HAWKS: Dennis Schroder should be less Rajon Rondo and more Tony Parker\nWashington Wizards\n© Provided by Sporting News\nLast season: 46-36, 1-3 vs. the Cavaliers.\nThe Wizards' resurgence hasn’t been meteoric, but it has been fun to watch. John Wall and Bradley Beal present an enthralling 1-2 punch if Beal can stay healthy. To win the East, those two will need to outplay Kyrie Irving and Iman Shumpert. The matchup could have happened last season if not for Wall missing three games in the conference semis versus the Hawks.\nThe Wiz were a strong defensive and rebounding team in the postseaon, which is the formula to beat David Blatt's guys. Washington's bench was upgraded this offseason with Gary Neal and Jared Dudley . Dudley is a versatile defender who can stick bigger guards and nearly any forward. Neal averaged 16 points per 36 minutes last year.\nMORE: Visual history of the Wizards\nUnlike the Hawks, the Wizards have yet to reach their ceiling. If completely healthy, the Wizards can give the Bulls or Heat a run for their money. However, if any of their top seven is injured, they may be relegated to the 6th or 7th seed. Otto Porter will be crucial as he will be asked to start at small forward with the departure of Paul Pierce . Porter took a step forward last year, playing better with more minutes.\nPierce hit some massive shots ( even one that didn't count ) when the Wizards needed, but Porter is an upgrade on the defense, posting a higher defensive box plus-minus than The Truth last season. Plus, they still have Beal or Wall to take over on the clutch side.\nConcerns or not, the Wizards are the last of the teams that seem capable of beat the Cavaliers. Still, snow-cone's chances in very sunny place.\nMORE WIZARDS: John Wall's pricy painting of himself\nThe not-quite-ready teams\n© Provided by Sporting News\nThis list focuses on this season's contenders, but there are plenty of interesting, high-potential teams in the East. The bottom half of the conference will be much better than years passed. Not all 15 teams can make the playoffs, though, so let's look ahead. James figures to terrorize the East for the rest of his career, anyway.\nBut that doesn't mean every year will be a cakewalk. Here's some teams that could make noise in the next few years.\nMORE: NBA divisions may be dead, but rivalries can be resuscitated\nMilwaukee Bucks (41-41, 1-3 vs. Cleveland)\nThe Bucks will get the No. 2 overall pick from a year ago Jabari Parker, who played just 25 games in 2014-15, back and added Greg Monroe . This team took two games from the Bulls in the first round of the postseason in April, so they could very well win a playoff series next season . They addressed their struggling offense, which failed to break 70 points in the Bucks' season-ending loss, by getting Monroe and Greivis Vasquez.\nAs long as it maintains its gritty defensive reputation, Milwaukee could be excellent in two years. It's a young squad all around, from third-year coach Jason Kidd, to 20-year-olds Parker and Giannis Antetokounmpo, so winning the East now seems unrealistic. But the Bucks will give the Bulls, Heat and Hawks some headaches this season, and LeBron some losses in the future.\nToronto Raptors (49-33, 1-3 vs. Cleveland)\nThe Raptors started last season convincing some there were legitimate contenders in the East. That all ended when they hobbled to the finish line and were swept by a stifling Washington team. It was obvious this team needed a little bit of everything — another scorer, better defense and a reliable big man. They answered two of those calls by picking up DeMarre Carroll , Cory Joseph and Luis Scola. More aid came in Bismack Biyombo, a defensive-minded big man who can play center behind Jonas Valanciunas .\nThis team will go as far as the trio of Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan and Carroll will take them. If they put up duds against tough playoff defense like they did versus Washington, they'll be playing golf by the end of April. Doesn't sound too fun in Toronto. But success this year is not as important as building chemistry for future seasons and letting Valanciunas grow into a bigger role. Only then, and with another scorer off the bench, will this team be able to really compete.\nIndiana Pacers (38-44, 2-2 vs. Cleveland)\nIt's been a weird 18 months for Indiana. The team went from title contenders to losing its best player and missing the playoffs in 2014-15. Rebuild right? Not in the weak East. The Pacers have the pieces to make the postseason. Adding Monta Ellis shows the team wants to win. They also have Paul George returning after playing just six games last season.\nThey lost David West, Roy Hibbert, Luis Scola and C.J. Watson, who are all on the wrong side of 30, save for Hibbert. That shows they are thinking of the future. Additions like Jordan Hill and Chase Budinger says they want NBA playoff-ready talent, however, so this is a bit of a mixed bag. Not a bad mix, though. Hill had very similar numbers to West last season, which makes his presence that much smarter. With rookies Rakeem Christmas, Myles Turner and Joseph Young, this team has a nice trajectory moving forward as George is still just 25 years old..\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links":
