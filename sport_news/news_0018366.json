FOOTBALL: Milton stays perfect Quarterback Mike Fallon accounted for four TDs – two running, two passing – Friday night in leading the Wildcats to a 34-23 home win over Dedham. Comment By David Konowitch The Patriot Ledger   10:40 pm Updated at 10:57 PM MILTON – The Milton High football team overcame a slow start to take down winless Dedham, 34-23, Friday night. The Wildcats (6-0, 4-0 Bay State Conference) remained unbeaten behind a 14-point second quarter. The win was big for the Wildcats, as they move on to face Wellesley in a game that will decide the winner of the Herget Division. After an offensive struggle in the first quarter, senior quarterback Mike Fallon (15 of 33 passing, 178 yards, 4 total TDs) got the Wildcats on the board with a 5-yard keeper to take the lead, 6-0. A 36-yard pass from Fallon to senior running back Mack Feeney (7 rushes, 78 yards) sparked the drive. Dedham (0-6, 0-4) responded with a strong drive of its own, but the Marauders were unable to get a touchdown as the Milton defense held stout, led by senior linebacker Akeem Smith, forcing a a 25-yard field goal to close the gap to 6-3. After both teams exchanged punts, the Wildcats took over with 1:58 to play in the half on their own 43. Fallon ran a 2-minute drill to perfection, as the Wildcats went 57 yards in eight plays, culminating with a 5-yard strike from Fallon to senior Dave Perkins (5 catches, 54 yards, 2 TDs) with 18 seconds to play. The duo connected again on the 2-point conversion to give Milton a 14-3 lead heading into halftime. Dedham came out of halftime hot and found the end zone on its first play from scrimmage with a 58-yard passing connection between quarterback Liam Madden and Stephen Acosta to trim the lead to 14-10. After the big play by Dedham, the second half was all Milton as it controlled the ball on two big scoring drives. Behind a couple of big rushes from Feeney, the Wildcats got into Dedham territory, where Fallon found Perkins again from 25-yards out to push the lead to 20-10. Following a Dedham three-and-out, Feeney scampered in from 17 yards out to try to put the game out of reach at 28-10 with 9:21 to play. Dedham fought back quickly, however, as Acosta hauled in a 51-yard TD reception to close the gap to 28-17. Acosta added a third score with 1:07 to play. The Wildcats were able to bleed the clock and then seal the game on an interception by senior Joe Quinn that set up the final TD as Fallon scored on a rush from 3 yards out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:26:44.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
