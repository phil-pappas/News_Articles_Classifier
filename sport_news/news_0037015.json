As a result, this generation is not viewed as a good one for car purchasing.\nScion is hoping its new iA sub-compact sedan will change all that. It has come to market with a car that it hopes will revitalize its own sales as well as revitalize Millennial interest in car buying. Doug Murtha, Scion’s group vice president, said at the media introduction of the Scion iA in Philadelphia, “These folks aren’t conspicuous consumers but they do allow themselves practical indulgences.”\nThis iA is practical in many ways but also appealing. The front fascia has come under attack by some, but it’s distinctive in person, and not in a bad way. Being distinctive is important in a segment that sees cookie-cutter sameness among the cars.\n Appealing to Millennials is crucial to Scion because it expects half of its iA buyers to be under the age of 35—in a market where the average age is 52. No wonder the company is using the actor who played Urkel on the popular 1990s sitcom, Family Matters, as its spokesman. Murtha said 70 percent of Scion iA owners would be first-time buyers.\nStory continues after gallery.\nConsumer Reports names the best and worst cars of 2015:\nPrevious -- of -- Next Consumer Reports recently named its picks for the Best and Worst vehicles of 2015. Check out the cars that earned the magazine’s top honors, and the ones that could stand to improve a lot. Courtesy of Subaru Previous -- of -- Next Best: Volkswagen Golf. According to CR, the Golf “exudes a quality” that most other hatchbacks can’t deliver. It has a 1.8-liter engine and gets 28 mpg. CR also praised the Golf’s quiet ride, handling, and intuitive infotainment system. Volkswagen of America, Inc.. Previous -- of -- Next Best: Volkswagen GTI. CR praised the GTI for being “deliriously fun to drive” thanks in large part to its 2.0-liter, 210 horepower turbo engine. The GTI also won over critics with an interior that uses top-notch materials, comfortable seats, and an affordable MSRP that starts at $24,785. Volkswagen via AP Previous -- of -- Next Best: Ford F-150. By using aluminum for its body frame instead of steel, the Ford F-150 lost 700 pounds of body weight. It has a 2.7-liter, V6 turbo engine that delivers an overall fuel economy of 17 mpg and gets 325 horsepower. Carlos Osorio / AP Photo Previous -- of -- Next Best: Mercedes-Benz C-Class. CR says the Mercedes-Benz C-Class offers a lush interior packed with high-end materials that create a luxurious experience and could teach its rival, BMW, a few lessons. Mercedes-Benz Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Best: Porsche Macan. CR praised the Porsche Macan for combining the effectiveness of a compact SUV with the power of a performance car. It delivers handling, acceleration, and braking that rivals most sports sedans. Porsche Previous -- of -- Next Best: Kia Sorento. CR critics praised the Kia Sorento for achieving “city-friendly size with family-friendly accommodations.” The Sorento can seat seven, and delivers a comfortable ride, a quiet cabin, and a high-quality infotainment system. Courtesy of Kia Motors Previous -- of -- Next Best: Subaru Legacy. The Subaru had a good year with Consumer Reports. First, the Subaru Legacy impressed critics for offering a comfortable ride, all-wheel drive, a spacious and quiet interior, and a strong fuel economy. CR said the Legacy stands out from other family sedans that are “bland” in comparison. Courtesy of Subaru Previous -- of -- Next Best: Subaru Outback. Subaru’s strong performance continues (and concludes) with the Subaru Outback. The Outback won over CR critics as a “winter-ready” vehicle. The Outback stood out for having a higher clearance that allows it to avoid snow that the plows may have missed. Courtesy of Subaru Previous -- of -- Next Worst: Chrysler 200. CR says the redesigned Chrysler 200 misses the mark, faulting it for its “unrefined transmission, klutzy handling, and a cramped rear seat.” When paired against other midsized sedans, consumers have much better options to pick from. Aaron Bragman Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Worst: Kia Sedona. CR called the Kia Sedona a “mediocre” minivan that delivers an unfriendly ride, a noisy cabin, and limited interior flexibility. Kia via AP Previous -- of -- Next Worst: Land Rover Discovery Sport. CR said the Discovery Sport fails to deliver the luxury that its parent brand is known for, with difficult handling, an outdated infotainment system, and a ride that feels heavy. Bill Griffith Previous -- of -- Next Worst: Lexus NX 200t/300h. CR says the Lexus NX delivers a firm, jostling ride. Inside, critics say it has an unimpressive interior and the infotainment system features a complicated touchscreen. Toyota via AP This part of the market is expected to sell upwards of 250,000 vehicles this year. Scion is hoping to be responsible for 35,000 to 40,000 of those sales.\nWhere it might succeed is in price and value for money. The Scion iA has a starting price of $15,700 for the six-speed manual transmission and $16,800 for the six-speed automatic. Both prices are before $795 destination charge. Scion sees the Ford Fiesta, Nissan Versa, Hyundai Accent, and Chevrolet Sonic as its main competition.\nThat starting price is well above the $11,990 starting price of the Nissan Versa, but the Scion feels like a much more substantial car. The iA otherwise is right in the mix with the other competition and priced below the Toyota Corolla, which would be its nearest competition in the Toyota family.\nWhere the Scion really scores is value. Included in its base price is keyless entry with push-button start. I’ve driven $40,000 pickups recently that don’t have this feature yet I’m finding it in a sub-compact sedan.\nThe Scion iA has a roomy interior with a well laid-out dashboard that is fairly intuitive in its design. Scion Sure, gas prices are low but that doesn’t mean one still can’t find value in fuel economy. The 2016 Scion iA is rated by the EPA at an estimated 33 city/ 42 highway/ 37 combined MPG for the automatic version and 31 city/ 41 highway/ 35 combined for the manual.\nSafety is also an important consideration, especially in a small car. The Scion iA features a standard low-speed pre-collision system that uses a laser sensor to help the driver avoid collisions and to help minimize damage in the event of an accident. The iA also features a brake override system and a rear view back-up camera comes standard.\nThe pre-collision systems looks out 20 feet ahead and works from 2 to 18 mph. Scion says more rear collisions occur below 30 mph. The system will pre-charge the brake system and alert the driver. Failing all that, it will bring the car to a halt (as much as it can).\nOn paper, a 1.5-liter engine with 106 horsepower and 103 lb. ft. of torque doesn’t sound like much but it was in the Scion iA. In highway traffic in and around Philadelphia (which seems to replicate Greater Boston), this little car with two adults onboard had no trouble merging and getting the job done.\nYou can get a little performance boost from sport mode when you purchase the automatic transmission. It will hold lower gears longer and provide more throttle output for more spirited performance. It did make the Scion more engaging to drive.\nTHE BASICS: Price, base (with destination): $16,495 Fuel economy: 31-city/41-highway/35-combined Drivetrain: 1.5-liter, four-cylinder engine: Sub-compact sedan.\nTHE SPECIFICS: Horsepower: 106 @ 6,000 rpm Torque: 103 @ 4,000 rpm Overall length: 171.7 in. Wheelbase: 101.2 in. Height: 58.5 in. Width: 66.7 in. Curb weight: 2,385 lbs.\nTHE GOOD: Scion has succeeded in creating a sub-compact with a distinctive sense of style that delivers good value and safety for its price.\nTHE BAD: The Scion iA feels a tad underpowered compared to other cars in its segment but that is offset somewhat by the sport mode on the automatic transmission.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: Scion is making its way back to significance in the U.S. market with this car, one that deserves strong consideration by buyers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:06:24.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
