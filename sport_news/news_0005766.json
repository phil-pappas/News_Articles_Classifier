So are my ears from the onslaught of voice mail left on the telephone and verbal reaction from people on the street. Like the basketball series, the feedback has been tremendous. From selected players thanking me for putting their name on a roster to a couple of ex-players wondering why their names were left off and an assortment of mixed messages in-between. Everything from “when it comes to high school football in this area, you’re the man” to “did you even see a game in the 1980s?” But, those are some of the normal overreactions you get from opinion pieces. Between the full basketball series, which ran for 12 consecutive days this past summer, and four consecutive Sundays of the current nine-part Sunday football series, I’ve been roasted, toasted, hailed and assailed. It’s the kind of reaction I anticipated and willingly accept. But, because I’m me, reaction goes both ways. Here’s an example. This is from an irate Fairhaven follower and came in the form of an email that was answered but, for some reason, was bounced back to me later in the day. I won’t mention the author’s name, but because he took the time to write, I feel he deserves an answer. The email: “You are killing me. You are kidding, right A kicker number two??? What a joke How on earth can you consider a KICKER one of the best FOOTBALL players??? That’s just silly.\" The response: If I had known you were going to get this upset, I would have considered putting him No. 1! Billy Teves wasn’t just a kicker. He was, by far, the top kicker (punter and place kicker) in the area (and beyond) and was recruited by more than a dozen big-name schools — including Syracuse. In his junior and senior seasons, he successfully converted 11 of 16 field goal attempts (two were blocked) with three of them game-winners during a 7-2-1 campaign in 1979. He was also a big-time punter with distance and the ability to drop the ball dead inside the 10-yard line. That same year he ran out of the halfback position and finished second on the team in touchdowns on his way to accounting for 48 (a team high) of his team’s 118 points. As a junior, he led Fairhaven in touchdowns and kicked a pair of field goals, including the game-winner in a 16-14 victory over Thanksgiving Day rival Dartmouth that snapped a three-year holiday game losing streak. Oh, by the way, he also played defense in the secondary. Billy Teves was more than just a kicker. He just happens to be, in my opinion, the most accurate and clutch kicker in school history. Another emailer thought I was doing a disservice to a handful of Bishop Stang football players from his era by not selecting them (and him) even though every player he mentioned was considered for selection, but fell short in my opinion. Why was this guy so irritated? Because my opinion happened to differ from his. And over the next five Sundays, those different opinions will continue to create friction. You’ll see a little of it this Sunday when we announce our Greater New Bedford/New Bedford Vocational series and you’ll, no doubt, see big-time friction following the unfolding of the teams from New Bedford High and Wareham. That’s just the way it is with opinion pieces. I said it before, during and after the basketball series. There is no right or wrong in opinion pieces. Opinions vary and just because you may agree or disagree doesn’t make anyone right or wrong. Chances are the emails will continue to come in throughout the life of the series, and I will do my best to answer each and everyone. For the many who have asked, I’m not a big fan of social media. I prefer to converse by mouth, either in person or over the phone, and I respectfully decline any and all invitations to become anyone’s social media friend. Unlike the series, that’s not my opinion. That’s my option. Buddy Thomas’ column appears on Thursday in The Standard-Times.
