Gordon’s two-out seventh-inning double off Toronto ace David Price scored Mike Moustakas for the go-ahead run, and the Royals rallied for a 6-3 win in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series. \n“He was cruising,” Gordon said of Price. “We got that early at-bat. Price is a tough pitcher. I felt like we needed to catch a break. And Ben Zobrist’s ball there I think got things going. And once this lineup gets moving, it’s one guy after another, and it was a big seventh inning.” \nAfter reaching second base, Gordon, who rarely shows emotion on the field, gave a big fist pump in excitement. Gordon’s hit sent Price (1-2) to the showers, his otherwise stellar line marred by a 30-pitch seventh inning in which he gave up five hits and five runs. Through six innings, the Royals mounted a rather feeble attack against Price. \nThe Toronto left-hander had stymied the Royals bats, not allowing a runner to cross home plate, and only giving up a first-pitch single to Alcides Escobar. But these are the Royals, and they have a tendency to rally. And that’s just what they did. \nTrailing 3-0 to start the bottom of the seventh, the Royals rally began with consecutive singles by Zobrist — whose hit fell between two Blue Jays in position to catch it in shallow right field — Lorenzo Cain and Eric Hosmer. \nKendrys Morales and Moustakas each produced RBIs, setting up Gordon’s at-bat, which was followed by an RBI single from Alex Rios that sent the crowd of 40,357 into a frenzy. \n“(Price), he’s one pitch away from getting out of that,” said Toronto manager John Gibbons. “And, of course, the big hit by Gordon with a good at-bat. You can’t really pitch a better game to that point, anyway.” \nMoustakas, who broke out of an 0 for 13 skid, went 2 for 4 with two RBIs. \n“I haven’t been getting a lot of hits, but I’ve been putting together good at-bats,” Moustakas said. “That keeps me going. It’s nice when you’re putting together quality at-bats, just not getting results. Today was nice to get that big hit and get on base for Gordo to drive me in. And later put in another good at-bat and got another knock, so it was good.” \nDanny Duffy (1-0) pitched a scoreless seventh before giving way to Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis. Yordano Ventura started for the Royals, giving up three runs in 5 1/3 innings while giving up eight hits and striking out six to go with two walks. \nOn the road to the ALCS, the Royals had to overcome the loss of Gordon as he missed about two months with a severe groin strain. Since his return from the disabled list, Gordon has struggled at times offensively but has had some big moments. In Game 1 of the ALCS, he hit a key double and scored a run. He also hit a home run in Game 3 of the AL Division Series and drove in the go-ahead run in Game 4 before adding a key double and scoring a run in Game 5. \n“It’s always tough to miss time during the year, when you’re not able to swing or see a lot of pitching, to come back and just get right back into it,” Gordon said. “I felt like I did a pretty good job of staying in shape, staying game ready. I had my struggles a little bit when I came back. \n“But overall, right now I feel pretty good and feel comfortable at the plate, and I’m seeing the ball good. I’ve been here for about a month and a half since the injury. I finally started to feel like I’m back in the groove.” \nGordon and the Royals will now head to Toronto for Game 3 on Monday. Two more wins and they’ll be back in the World Series for the second year in a row, a feat that at one time seemed impossible during the lean years of Gordon’s career but now could be a reality. \n“Ever since Dayton Moore came here, he’s done a great job of drafting quality players and the right players, and developing them through the system,” Gordon said. “And we knew it wasn’t going to be just one guy. \n“I was — not fortunate enough — but was sent down and actually got to see the Moustakases, the Hosmers, and the (Salvador) Perezes in the minor leagues, and knew they were going to come up quickly and be something special. Gelling with some of the guys that were already here, it’s worked out pretty well.” \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:40:32.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
