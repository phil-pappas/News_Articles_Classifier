They had found little resistance Tuesday, in a 23-point romp against Olimpia Milano in Italy. While Real Madrid – a veteran-laden squad most consider to be one of the top international teams – managed to keep things close into the second quarter, it was eventually no match for the Celtics as they punctuated their overseas trip with a 111-96 victory. Avery Bradley scored 17 points with three 3-pointers in 21 minutes, David Lee shook off a pregame illness to turn in a double-double of 13 points and 11 rebounds in 21 minutes, and Isaiah Thomas struck for 15 points in 25 minutes off the bench for Boston. Perhaps most impressive was the way the young group that Celtics coach Brad Stevens used in the fourth quarter iced the game against Real Madrid’s starters. Rookie Terry Rozier scored 14 points with four assists, while rookie Jordan Mickey had some great hustle plays on the boards, and rookie R.J. Hunter displayed deft passing ability and instincts on both ends of the floor. Boston was without Evan Turner (strained knee), Amir Johnson (illness) and Perry Jones III (returned to America due to a family death). The Celtics trailed, 35-33, early in the second quarter when Jae Crowder (8 points, 6 assists) returned to the floor and sparked a 13-3 run along with Bradley. Boston took a 10-point lead into the half that reached 18 on a Thomas 3-pointer late in the third quarter. The rookie trio helped stretch the gap as high as 25 midway through the fourth. The Celtics were set to return to Boston on Saturday and are expected to resume practice in Waltham, Mass., on Monday afternoon. The next two exhibition games are in Brooklyn (Wednesday) and New York (Friday).
