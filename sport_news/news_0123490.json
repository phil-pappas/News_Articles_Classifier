In need of any kind of win to halt a rare losing streak, the Raiders didn't budge. SOU came from behind by scoring five of the final six points in a 25-15, 23-25, 25-15, 26-24 victory over the Eagles to remain in second place in the Cascade Conference standings. Four Raiders put up double-figure kill totals: Tyana Andrews (17), Corynn Kopra (15), Niki Small (12) and Laura Morse (12). Small was particularly impressive, doing her damage on just 18 attacks with one error in leading SOU to a team attacking average of .308. She also assisted four blocks, including two to help the Raiders erase Northwest's 23-21 fourth-set advantage and one with Lauren McGowne to seal the match. McGowne distributed a match-high 55 assists to go with eight digs and three assisted blocks. The Raiders went to 16-2 overall and 9-2 in the CCC going into Saturday's 5 p.m. meeting with Evergreen. Northwest – which entered the night tied for third place but had yet to take a set off any of the other top-three teams – fell to 12-6 and 8-4. \"We weren't perfect tonight but we played well enough to win,\" SOU coach Josh Rohlfing said. \"I was really proud of the way we handled adversity against a Northwest team that's much improved and very, very solid.\" Mattie Jo Johnson delivered 14 kills on a .667 attacking average for the Eagles, who hit .199 as a team. The Raiders dominated the first set, going on a 7-1 run to make it 17-10 and never looking back. They were even better in the third, attacking .552 and forcing side-outs on 14 of 16 Northwest serves. But the Eagles extended the match by scoring the last four points of the second set after falling behind 23-21, as Sydney Schlect finished a couple kills and was in on a block to earn the win. Then they broke a 17-all tie in the fourth with three straight points before SOU answered. Andrews and Kopra had five kills apiece in the final set. They also both finished with nine digs, and Morse had a team-high 13. Northwest had nine blocks, led by Johnson's seven assisted. Schlect added 10 kills, Emmaline Stockton had 10 digs, and Morgan Pilon had 40 assists. SOU has won 16 straight at home dating back to 2013. Women's Soccer At Olympia, Wash., Southern Oregon got four goals from its reserves, the most off the bench in program history, and stayed hot Friday afternoon with a 5-0 defeat of Evergreen at Geoduck Pitch. Yvonne Valencia scored once in each half for the first goals of her career and added an assist, Maddy Spangler tallied a goal in the second half to go with her first two assists of the season, and Lauren Aldana and Sarah Garoutte both found the back of the net in the first. The Raiders (5-7-2 overall, 4-3 Cascade Conference) inched closer to clinching a CCC tournament berth with their fourth win in five games and their second five-goal effort in three outings. Their five goals were the most SOU has scored in a CCC shutout since the 2003 season. The Geoducks went to 1-7 overall and 1-3 in the circuit. Aldana, the only starter to score, put the Raiders up in the 28th minute with an angled shot that stayed just inside the far post. Spangler assisted Valencia three minutes later with a cross that led to a short shot, and Valencia hit Garoutte in the 36th minute for a 15-yard goal that made it 3-0 at halftime. SOU's second-half goals were recorded in the 77th and 80th minutes, as Spangler scored first and a few minutes later connected with Valencia for a tap-in. SOU had a 27-4 advantage in shot and nine corners to Evergreen's zero. Kylie Moltzen and Andi Rasmussen shared the keeper shutout, but neither had to make a save. The Raiders will make a short trip to Kirkland, Wash., for today's 2 p.m. contest at preseason CCC favorite Northwest (4-6-1, 3-1), which was a 3-0 winner Friday against Oregon Tech. Men's Soccer At Olympia, Wash., Evergreen tipped a scoreless game in its favor with two goals in the final 15 minutes to defeat the Southern Oregon men's soccer team Friday afternoon, 2-0 at the Geoduck Pitch. Juan Lopez netted a 20-yard shot in the 76th minute, and Tanner Williams rebounded Lopez's deflected shot for a tap-in goal in the 84th. The Geoducks, who recorded just three shots on goal in the opening 75 minutes, improved to 8-1 overall and 5-1 in the Cascade Conference with their fifth shutout of the season. SOU (9-5, 4-5) played another top team in the conference admirably but didn't have many meaningful possessions. Reserves Justin Griego and Paul Matyas produced the only shots on goal, both in the second half. The Raiders have been blanked just three times this season. Cross Country At San Francisco, Jessa Perkinson's outstanding individual effort highlighted the 15th-ranked Southern Oregon women's cross country team's performance Friday afternoon at the San Francisco State Invitational, while the top-ranked Raider men traveled in packs during a solid team effort. Perkinson, a sophomore from Roseburg, had perhaps the best day of her young career at Speedway Meadow in Golden Gate Park, placing fourth of 232 total entries in the women's 6,000-meter race in 21 minutes 47.6 seconds – just eight seconds off the leader. The Raiders took fourth of 20 teams in the men's 8K, led by 15th-place Ray Schireman (25:16.7), 18th-place Connor Cushman (25:21.0) and 22nd-place Jared Hixon (25:28.6). SOU's top-eight finishers were separated by just 80 seconds. The three teams that placed ahead of the SOU men all appear in the NCAA Div. II rankings: Chico State (No. 2), Cal Baptist (No. 6 West Region) and San Francisco State (No. 24). SOU's other scorers were Zach Boyd-Helm (33rd, 25:43.4), Trevor Lynn (47th, 26:06.0), Matthew Williams (81st, 26:34.6) and Eli Stillman (84th, 26:36.4), while Noah Oberitter (86th, 26:36.5) was just back. Chico State's William Reyes earned the nine-second victory in 24:35.2. The Raider women took eighth of 22 in the team standings. Following Perkinson, Rebecca Lupescu placed 65th (23:26.8) and Aspen Abbott was 79th (23:52.3). The other four scorers – 95th-place Margarita Lauer (24:10.4), 110th-place Braana Weber (24:35.5), 122th-place Marisa D'Orfani (24:36.5) and 123rd-place Kayle Blackmore (24:50.1) — were separated by 40 seconds.
