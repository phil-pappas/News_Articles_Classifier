Senior Brett Calderone scored from 13 yards away and James Kennedy made the extra point kick to give the Warriors a 7-6 advantage 5:33 into the first quarter.\nBut Garfield came right back with a quick 65-yard, two-play thrust of its own, scoring on a 55-yard touchdown pass from Victorino to Nolasco.

A 1-yard touchdown run by Irving capped a 70-yard, six-play touchdown march and Victorino’s two-point conversion pass to Anthony Barksdale made it 22-13 with 3:35 left in the half.\nDiPasquale’s 4-yard touchdown burst with 2:09 left before the break to end a 68-yard, 7-play drive pulled Waldwick/Midland Park within 22-19.\nBut Garfield got two touchdowns in a row in the final two minutes of the half to extend the lead. First came an electrifying 74-yard touchdown run by Irving, and when Victorino found DeLorenzo with the two-point conversion pass it was 30-19 Garfield with 1:47 remaining until intermission.\nNolasco’s 85-yard interception return came with 51 seconds left in the half and Montanye’s two-point conversion run made it 38-19 for Garfield at halftime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:54:28.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
