BolinArkansas News Bureau -   A week removed from the scandal that wasn’t, Bret Bielema and the Arkansas football team have returned to making preparations. The midway point of the season has gone and with it the team’s bye. \nNow the focus shifts to Auburn, another SEC West team that has failed to live up to preseason expectations. The Tigers were predicted during SEC Media Days as the conference’s overall champion. Late October and they sit in the division’s cellar, along with the Razorbacks and Mississippi State. \nAbsent the importance for avoiding last place in the West, Saturday was always going to be the most anticipated games of the Arkansas football season. Bielema made sure of that August 28. \n“Probably doesn’t need to be said in here how much I hate Auburn,” Bielema said that night to fans and donors at the team’s preseason kickoff reception at the Springdale Country Club. \nThe remarks were met that night with a few guffaws and some scattered applause. It wasn’t until the quote circulated on social media the buzzes came. \nThat was largely because it wasn’t the first time Bielema had taken a shot toward Auburn. When he first arrived at Arkansas he and Auburn coach Gus Malzahn exchanged indirect jabs about offensive philosophies. Similar Bielema comments would see Bielema take heat again just over two years later when Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury relayed the comments he made in front of a group of Texas high school football coaches. \nAt the time the Springdale-dropped phrase was the latest in a summer filled with quotable moments. Bielema had shined at those conference media days with lines such as “borderline erotic.” But the line about Auburn was the first sign of the new season. Arkansas was hopeful to compete with Malzahn’s team near the top of the division. It didn’t come to fruition and Bielema revisited those comments Monday before the teams’ meeting this Saturday at 11 a.m. at Donald W. Reynolds Stadium. \n“I don’t have a problem with him,” Bielema said Monday about Malzahn.“As you become acquainted with the Arkansas fan base and everything else, everybody always wants to beat certain teams and I probably hear it more about that game than anything.” \nArkansas could use a plus. The team’s record (2-4) is worst in the division. But the four team’s to which Arkansas lost have gone a combined 22-4. All four all ranked. Only Texas Tech, which beat Arkansas 35-24, is unranked and the Red Raiders are receiving the 30th most votes in the Associated Press Top 25 poll. \nAuburn is on quarterback No. 2 after preseason All-SEC second-teamer Jeremy Johnson was demoted just a couple weeks into the season. While the Tigers have a stronger overall record, consider the team’s season-opening opponent – Louisville – has four losses by themselves. Auburn also needed a final-seconds rally to defeat Football Championship Subdivision team Jacksonville State. \nBut Auburn also has won two straight games, including their first in SEC play, most recently beating Kentucky by three points, 30-27. Arkansas hasn’t won two straight games almost a year. \nIn fact, this was about the time last year the Razorbacks reversed their fortunes. The team had just come off a loss to Georgia that wasn’t nearly as close as the 45-32 final score. Arkansas beat a now non-existent Alabama-Birmingham team and followed that with a trip to Mississippi State. In Starkville, Arkansas lost to the No. 1 team in the nation by a touchdown. Two SEC shutouts came after that. \nBielema isn’t saying that’s in the cards again. He also isn’t saying it’s not. \n“I feel good because I know we got stronger in the last several weeks,” Bielema said. “I saw what this team did a year ago and I see a lot of those same things coming to phase in front of us. \n“I know it’s not where everybody wants to be at the right time, but the fact of the matter is, that’s what reality gives us right now until we get a little bit better depth.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:06:48.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
