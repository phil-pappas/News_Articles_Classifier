That’s the record the last four programs to lose a Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback had the following season. In 2010, Florida went 8-5 overall and 4-4 in the SEC after saying goodbye to Tim Tebow, who had led he Gators to a 26-2 record over the previous two seasons. In 2011, the year after Cam Newton led 14-0 Auburn to a BCS national championship victory over Oregon, the Tigers went 8-5 overall and 4-4 in the SEC. In 2012, after Robert Griffin III put Baylor’s offense on the map during a high-scoring 10-3 campaign, the Bears were 8-5 overall and 4-5 in the Big 12. In 2014, Texas A&M went 8-5 overall (3-5 conference) after Johnny Manziel left College Station a year early for the NFL. The Aggies had a 20-6 record during their first two seasons in the SEC with “Johnny Football.” Florida State (Jameis Winston) and Oregon (Marcus Mariota) replaced Heisman winners this season with graduate transfers. The Seminoles are 6-0 and ranked No. 9 with former Notre Dame quarterback Everett Golson. The Ducks are 4-3 overall and 2-2 in the Pac-12, but Eastern Washington transfer Vernon Adams Jr. missed three starts and the better part of 16 quarters because of a broken index finger. After returning to the starting lineup for Saturday’s 26-20 victory at Washington, Adams was asked if Oregon could win out. “We’ve just got to clean up the little baby mistakes, the penalties, continue not to turn the ball over and be better on third down,” Adams said. “If we do that, I think we’ve got a good shot at it.” Adams’ ability to buy extra time and throw the ball downfield added another dimension to Oregon’s offense, which leads the Pac-12 in rushing (297.4 yards per game). He passed for 272 yards and two touchdowns and did not turn the ball over against a stout Washington defense. Darren Carrington (125 yards, two touchdowns) and Bralon Addison (78 yards) had five catches each, and Dwayne Stanford added a 48-yard reception. Royce Freeman ran the ball 27 times for 138 yards against the Huskies, who designed their defensive game plan around stopping him. “When you have a quarterback, not that they don’t have confidence in anybody else, but when the team has confidence in the quarterback or a little bit of juice because of the quarterback — just as they do for Royce or DeForest Buckner — that elevates everybody,” coach Mark Helfrich said. Adams was pulled in the first quarter of the 62-20 loss to Utah in the conference opener. Jeff Lockie and Taylor Alie both played meaningful snaps in his absence, a road win at Colorado and the humbling loss to Washington State in double overtime. “We need to play better at quarterback,” offensive coordinator Scott Frost said when asked about Oregon’s identity on offense in the aftermath of the 45-38 loss to the Cougars at Autzen Stadium. “It would be great if we could have one guy taking all the snaps, but we’re not fortunate enough to have that situation.” Washington’s defense held Cody Kessler to 156 yards passing and intercepted the USC quarterback twice during a 17-12 victory over the Trojans. In two starts at Husky Stadium — Eastern Washington’s 59-52 loss last season and Oregon’s 12th consecutive victory over Washington — Adams passed for 747 yards and nine touchdowns without an interception. “He’s going to watch the tape, and a bunch of times there’s plays to be made,” Helfrich said of Adams’ performance. “He free-lanced a few things. When you look at it, we converted more third downs on our first drive than USC did all last week; that was kind of the animal that you’re playing against from a defensive standpoint.” “After a couple of those happened, I think absolutely that (confidence) is something that permeates your team.” Oregon hopes to get some more injured players back before the Ducks plan another road game on Oct. 29 at Arizona State in Sun Devil Stadium at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN. The Ducks play two ranked teams, No. 20 California and No. 10 Stanford, to start November before finishing the regular season at home against USC and Oregon State. The College Football Playoff is out of reach for Oregon. Stanford and Utah are currently in control of the Pac-12 North and South Divisions, respectively. But the Ducks are looking forward to making a run down the stretch with Adams. “Vernon is a special player and he showed some of that (at Washington),” Frost said. “He made us go, extending some plays and making some throws, and we’ve been missing that a little bit in our offense. “I feel great for him that people get to see what he’s like when he’s healthy.” By Ryan Thorburn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:32:35.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
