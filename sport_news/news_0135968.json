They waited for the fourth quarter bago sila nagtrabaho. It’s not a good sign for us.”\n“But as long as we get the win, in the end that’s the only concern we have.”\nRoger Pogoy led FEU with 17 points while Mike Tolomia added 11 markers.\nEarlier, La Salle survived a big third quarter surge by University of the East before getting its bearings back in the payoff period to eke out a 72-64 victory and move to solo third at 5-4.\nThe Green Archers turned to Jeron Teng, Prince Rivero and Larry Muyang in the second half to win the game marred by the Big Dome’s new security measures that irked members of the media.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:41:12.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
