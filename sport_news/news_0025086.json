MSH Architects have set up an exhibit outside of the old Ming Wah Cafe as part of Sioux Falls Design Week. \nTaking a quick glance as you drive by the old restaurant on 10th Street, you may think the building was vandalized. But these chalkboard dreams of what could be built at this location were put up by MSH Architects as part of Sioux Falls Design Week. \n\"Jump in, have fun. That's the whole idea is to express yourself how you can and that's what this is all about,\" Bob Natz said. \nNatz, MSH's director of design, says his staff's idea called Site Unseen was inspired by artist Candy Chang. \n\"We've got some great comments. Some are more doable than others. A moonlit beach, as creative as that is, might be hard to do,\" Natz said. \nFrom daycare to donuts and an ice cream shop, there are a lot of ideas. There are even some fun suggestions such as \"A place that would hire me.\" \nKellen Boice with the Sioux Falls Design Center says the creative project is one of many taking place this week. \n\"Getting the public's opinion on what could be in this empty vacant building. We happen to have a couple of those around town so they kind of chose that spot to look at what this could be to get the public's perception on that as well,\" Kellen Boice said. \nWhether or not the building's owner takes the wishes to heart is anyone's guess. Natz is just happy to see so many participate. \n\"Apple store would be kind of cool but I think the most doable would be the New York Style deli or restaurant. I thought those were great ideas myself,\" Natz said. \nThe project will be up until October 9 if you'd like to participate. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
