But he never was boring. \nSpurrier, 70, announced his \"resignation\" - that's what he preferred to call it - on Tuesday as the head coach at South Carolina. Known as the \"Old Ball Coach,\" he compiled a 228-89-2 record over 25 seasons - 11 with the Gamecocks, 12 with Florida, and three with Duke. He is the all-time wins leader at both South Carolina and Florida. \nKnown for his ever-present visor, Spurrier was an offensive innovator. He shook up the dreary Southeastern Conference offenses with the more wide-open \"Fun 'N' Gun\" at Florida. He left Gainesville after the 2001 season to satisfy a desire to be an NFL head coach, but after three years with the Washington Redskins, he returned to the college ranks. \nOf course, no one will ever forget Spurrier's sharp tongue. He said the initials for Florida State - FSU - stood for \"Free Shoes University.\" He said \"You can't spell Citrus without U-T\" and that the reason that Tennessee star Peyton Manning returned for his senior year was because \"he wanted to be a three-time star of the Citrus Bowl.\" More coverage SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise \nTexas head coach Charlie Strong, who worked under Spurrier at Florida, said his boss \"jabbed at everybody. \n\"Most of the time, all you could do was laugh because he just said what a lot of other people thought,\" Strong told ESPN.com. \"There won't ever be another one like him because coaches nowadays are too concerned about how it sounds.\" More USC drama \nReports of erratic behavior cost Steve Sarkisian his job as head coach at Southern California, and left the Trojans' players having to deal with another midseason change at the top. \nQuarterback Cody Kessler recalled the 2013 season, when Lane Kiffin was fired after five games. USC rebounded behind interim coach Ed Orgeron to win six of its last eight games, including the Las Vegas Bowl. And Kessler said the Trojans aren't going to miss a beat this weekend when they play at archrival Notre Dame. \n\"We've been through a lot of adversity,\" Kessler told reporters, \"and that's what we do best is move on. We have an opportunity to do something great this weekend. Notre Dame is a great football team, and we're excited to get out there.\" \nUSC will be led by offensive coordinator Clay Helton, who has been named interim head coach. What's with Michigan? \nSo what can we take out of Michigan's 5-1 start? That rookie head coach Jim Harbaugh is a genius? That predecessor Brady Hoke and his staff really knew how to recruit? That Harbaugh once sent a message at a team meeting by acting out \"imaginary conversations\" between two people, according to tight end Jake Butt? It's been a dizzying ride up the rankings for the Wolverines, who have won five straight, their last three by shutout. Now they host Michigan State, which is 6-1 in the last seven meetings between the two teams, and sticking to business. \n\"I'm sure there's going to be a lot of attempts to build this game up,\" Harbaugh said in an Associated Press story. \"But we're working and not worrying.\" No 'D' in Big 12 \nLook at the top of the NCAA statistics, and you'll see a lot of Big 12 teams at or near the top in several offensive categories. But when it comes to defense, it's best to just keep scrolling down, and scrolling down some more. In the early going, games involving Big 12 members have averaged 66.1 points and a combined 906.2 total yards, highest among the Power Five conferences. Baylor leads all of FBS in total offense, averaging 725 yards per game. Texas Tech is second in the league with 631.7 total yards, but also ranks in the bottom five in FBS in total defense at 566.7 yards per game. Clemsoning? \nThere is a listing in the Urban Dictionary for the word Clemsoning , which is defined as \"the act of an inexplicably disappointing performance, usually within the context of a college football season.\" \nWherever the word came from, Clemson coach Dabo Swinney hopes it will disappear, and he will do everything in his power to make sure that happens. Swinney blasted a reporter who asked a question mentioning the word after last Saturday's win by the Tigers over Georgia Tech. He was at it again on Tuesday, telling the Charleston Post and Courier that people who use the word are \"ignorant and lazy.\" \nHe added, \"There aren't three other schools in the country as consistent as Clemson, in all sports.\" Expatriate of the week \nDefensive end Dajuan Drennon, who starred at Timber Creek High School, has started every game this season for North Carolina, ranking sixth on the team with 19 tackles and third in tackles for loss with 2.5. The 6-foot-4, 255-pound sophomore is one of three local players on the Tar Heels. Junior John Ferranto (Burlington Township) has started two games at offensive left tackle, and junior Dan Mastromatteo (Holy Spirit) sees action at linebacker. The Tar Heels are seeking their first 2-0 start in the ACC since 1997 when they play Wake Forest. Star watch \nLeonard Fournette, RB, Louisiana State vs. Florida \n\nFournette last week became the 10th player in FBS history - and the first ever at LSU - to reach the 1,000-yard mark in five games, even though his 158 yards last week were a season low. He has 1,022 yards on 119 carries, an 8.6-yard average. Fournette has topped 200 yards in a game three times with a high of 244 against Syracuse. Saturday's best \nMichigan State at Michigan, 3:30 p.m., ESPN: The climb for the Wolverines under first-year coach Jim Harbaugh has been rapid: three straight shutouts and a rise to No. 12 in the polls. But the Spartans have Connor Cook, arguably the Big Ten's best quarterback and a veteran of big games. \nAlabama at Texas A&M, 3:30 p.m., CBS3: The Aggies still carry the bad taste of last year's 59-0 rout at the hands of the Crimson Tide with them and are at home, where the crowd won't allow them to let down. As for Alabama, which has one loss, every week is a playoff elimination game. \nFlorida at Louisiana State, 7 p.m., ESPN: An example of SEC imbalance: LSU is battling three teams to gain a foothold in the West; the Gators still will have control of the SEC East even with a loss. The Tigers have 1,000-yard rusher Leonard Fournette, while Florida is going with backup quarterback Treon Harris. \nSouthern California at Notre Dame, 7:30 p.m., NBC10: Here's a game that's tough to figure after the firing earlier this week of Trojans coach Steve Sarkisian. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton takes over and will try to ride quarterback Cody Kessler. The Fighting Irish need to put the heat on Kessler.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:50:47.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
