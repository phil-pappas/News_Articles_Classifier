When his dad woke up on Christmas morning and looked in the driveway of the family home, there was a brand new pickup truck waiting for him in the driveway courtesy of Santa Mike. \nA lot has happened since that time. Here’s hoping he gets the help he requires to straighten out his life which, as underscored by Lombardi’s comments, he obviously needs to do. \nLombardi said that that Richards’ fall from grace is “the most traumatic episode of my career,” adding “at times, I think that I will never recover from it.” \n“I heard the rumors that Mike might have some off-ice issues, but I refused to believe that they were true despite some obvious signs,” Lombardi wrote to Times. “The reality is that I was ‘played.’ My only regret, though, is that I wish Mike had been able to come to me with his problem — and that was the last message I left for him on his cellphone when I learned of the incident and all the history leading up to the incident.” \n“Anyone close enough to me knows how much I loved Mike Richards,” Lombardi added. “I believed that when I had acquired him, I had found my own Derek Jeter. But the fact is that he was never close to the player that he was after his best seasons in 2008-09 and 2009-10 in Philadelphia. His production dropped 50% and the certain ‘it’ factor he had was vaporizing in front of me daily.” \nSad. \nBLACK FRIDAY \nOn Friday afternoon the news came down that authorities had arrested TSN analyst Aaron Ward following a domestic incident. Captain Don Hamilton with the Cary (N.C.) Police Department said Ward had been brought into custody after police responded to a call concerning a domestic assault. Ward was charged with assault on a female and interfering with emergency communications, both misdemeanors. Hamilton said authorities initially cited Ward’s wife, Kelly, for misdemeanor simple assault on him, but they rescinded the citation after further investigation, and she faces no charges. \nHours later, former Red Wing Mike Commodore’s Twitter account featured an obscenity-laced tirade against Leafs coach Mike Babcock . \nAll this on Day 3 of the new season. \nLAST MINUTE OF PLAY \nMeanwhile, there was the road reaction to Hawks star Patrick Kane , who was greeted by chants of “No Means No” by Islanders fans at Brooklyn’s Barkley Center. \nKane had best brace himself. Because this won’t be the last time he gets mocked by opposing crowds around the league. \nInteresting, if not troubling times, in the first week of the NHL season. \nmike.zeisberger@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:10:04.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
