I am not a European Tour player, I am not an Asian Tour player, I just want to play with some good players.\" \nIn the past he has singled out world number four Bubba Watson as someone he'd like to emulate but at the Hong Kong Open he held up England's world number seven Justin Rose, who won the 2013 US Open, as someone he admired. \n\"He's a really nice guy -- and he's won a major,\" Li added with a grin.
