Muccilli/Staff Photographer) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Mid-State 38 is off to one of those seasons that leaves so many shaking their heads. \nHillsborough loses to Franklin and Watchung Hills with the chance to tie with a touchdown and extra point (Franklin) and a chance to win with a fourth-and-10 stop (Watchung Hills) in the waning seconds of regulation. Then the Raiders — having allowed more than 800 yards in offense in those two games — go and blank perennial power Hunterdon Central 42-0 in a game expected to be tight. \nBridgewater-Raritan (3-0) beats Phillipsburg 31-28, never giving up the lead but always seeming to be on the brink of giving it up. That was followed by the Panthers' 13-7 win over Union, when the offense got off to a quick start, but the defense delivered the win. \nLots of mystery — if not the clouds — may be cleared up tonight when No. 10 Hillsborough (1-2) plays host to No. 3 Bridgewater-Raritan (3-0) in another Delaware Division game. Kickoff is 7 p.m. at Noonan Field. \n\"I think our league is very weird this year,'' Bridgewater-Raritan coach Scott Bray said. \"You look at the scores, you look at the way some things have gone, and it boggles your mind. What's going on? One week Franklin is beating Hillsborough (34-27), then getting shut out by Union (21-0) and then loses by two to (unbeaten 3-0) Elizabeth (14-12). \n\"You want to talk about balance, very good teams — any week, anybody can beat anybody. Fortunately for us, we have stayed away from big mistakes and have been able to win,'' Bray added. \"No matter the weather, it's going to be a tough game.'' Harry Frezza's Week Four Football predictions \nTough weather is historically not friendly to passing teams — that would include both B-R and Hillsborough. B-R senior quarterback Eric Nickel has thrown for six touchdowns, and Hiillsborough's Al Fisher has thrown for nine. Nickel has reliable receivers in backs Matt Miliotis and Nick Attanazio and tight end Mike Celli. Promising junior wide receiver Ricky Tate has yet to have the kind of game Hillsborough sophomore Jackson Parsham had last week when he caught two touchdown passes. B-R senior wide receiver Ethan Christensen, who caught two touchdown passes in a 29-15 season-opening Sept. 11 win at Hunterdon Central, didn't play last week and won't tonight. \n\"We think we have a good passing game as well. If the rain comes the way we think, it'll be a neutralizing factor for both, both of us will have to deal with it,'' Bray said. \"Don't turn it over, don't give up the big run, make a team work in the pouring rain. That's what it comes down to — special teams, dropped punt, mishandled snaps...'' \nRunning backs Ryan Melillo and Kyle Kaufman can also catch Fisher's passes, and Parham is looking better and better with each game. The Raiders also have a solid receiver in Dillon Zimmerman and are looking quite athletic in other parts of the field. A lot for B-R to think about, but the Panthers have the kind of defense that could make it difficult, as they showed last week. Jon Kaye and Miliotis are the leaders of the B-R secondary, and that figures to be a busy place to be. \n\"They like to take shots down field, and they are fast,'' Nickel said. \nThe speed and quickness was shown from the very start of last week's game at Hunterdon Central. The Red Devils never recovered. \n\"Every game Hillsborough has played, they have scored points, and that's an issue coming in. We have to confront that, we can't allow them to get out there and get that momentum going,'' Bray said. \nStaff Writer Harry Frezza: hfrezza@gannettnj.com Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1KQ4zE2 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:15:55.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
