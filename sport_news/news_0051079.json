CHICAGO – After his team fell behind, 2-0, in this best-of-seven NLCS against the Mets on Sunday, Cubs manager Joe Maddon played music from the movie \"Rocky.\"\nWhile Rocky Balboa lost in the original film of the iconic series, Maddon tapped into the premise of an underdog putting in the work to go the distance in the title fight.\n\"One of my concepts is to win hard for 30 minutes or lose hard for 30 minutes regardless of the time of year,\" Maddon said Monday. \"When you get behind the eight ball a little bit, sometimes you go pound on some big slab of beef in the coolers and obviously you come back and you’re fine. It’s a game, and I’m really impressed with our players.\"\nWhile the Cubs face a daunting task after dropping the first two games in New York, Maddon is confident his team will rebound as the series shifts to Wrigley Field for the next three games. Kyle Hendricks faces Jacob deGrom tonight in Game 3.\n\"I just rather attempt to go out and win [tonight’s] game, that’s it. I don’t want them to think about it any other way, shape or form,\" Maddon said during a workout at Wrigley Field on Monday afternoon. \"We need to put together several one-game winning streaks. If we keep winning one game at a time, we’ve got a good shot of doing it.\"\nAfter defeating the Cardinals in the first round, the Cubs have been outplayed thus far in the first two games against the Mets. They sent their top two pitchers to the mound in Games 1 and 2 in Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta, and both surrendered four runs in losses.\nThe offense also has been stymied by the Mets’ vaunted pitching staff. The Cubs tagged Matt Harvey for two runs in Saturday’s loss, and only touched Noah Syndergaard for one Sunday. The Cubs were also unable to take advantage of the Mets having to get seven outs from relievers not named Jeurys Familia in the 4-1 loss Sunday.\nWith the Mets slated to have the pitching advantage in the next two games, it puts the upstart Cubs in a tough spot to win the series.\nMaddon vowed his team would be ready for Game 3, and the Cubs figure to hit better at Wrigley Field than they did at Citi Field.\n\"I just have a lot of faith in our guys,\" Maddon said. \"I promise you, they’re ready to play. Our guys are ready to play. We’ve been through moments in the past. I’ve been in these moments in the postseason in the past. Anything is possible.\n\"You’ve got to throw that jab. You’ve got to stagger the other guy a little bit and get momentum back in your favor, and that’s what we have to do.\"\nHendricks, who went 8-7 with a 3.95 ERA in the regular season, defeated the Mets by throwing six scoreless innings and allowing just three hits June 30.\n\"It’s awesome. I’m excited,\" Hendricks said. \"This is where we want to be. We’ve got to get this win. We’re back at home, and we’ve got the fans here. Hopefully we can get back on track and score a few runs.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:47:08.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
