Brown’s action helps San Diego stadium effort By BERNIE WILSON   \nSAN DIEGO (AP) - Mayor Kevin Faulconer calls it “a huge step forward” that Gov. Jerry Brown approved an accelerated judicial review process for any lawsuits filed against the environmental impact report for a proposed new stadium for the Chargers. \nAny lawsuit challenging the EIR must be resolved within 270 days of the city’s certifying the document. The city thinks it can open a new stadium by 2019 even if there is litigation on the EIR. \nSays Faulconer: “The governor stood up for San Diego and that’s a very good thing.” \nChargers attorney Mark Fabiani, who walked away from negotiations for a new stadium in mid-June, disagrees. Fabiani says the 270-day certification “is unfortunately irrelevant at this point” and the “quickie EIR is fatally flawed.” \nThe Chargers are eyeing a move to Los Angeles. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:39:51.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
