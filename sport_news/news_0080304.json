Huff slideshow MARIETTA — The most famous words in motorsports — “Gentlemen, start your engines!” — will be taking on a new meaning in Cobb County.That’s because the Andretti family, known for its decorated history in auto racing, is opening a second location of their Andretti Indoor Karting and Games facility.Located at 1255 Roswell Road just east of Interstate 75, the 100,000-square-foot facility features a bowling alley, two bars, a restaurant, arcade games, laser tag, ropes course, simulators, event spaces, meeting rooms and go-kart racing. Its grand opening is set for Saturday.Family patriarch Mario Andretti, son Michael, nephew John, grandson Marco and great-nephew Jarrett, were all on hand Tuesday, joining Marietta Mayor Steve Tumlin and other VIPs for a ribbon-cutting ceremony in anticipation of the opening.“With our schedules, it’s tough to get this many Andrettis together in one place,” said John, a former IndyCar and NASCAR winner, “but for us, this is very exciting. The team that put this together is phenomenal. Our family brand is important, and it’s important that this place represents us well.”The Andrettis christened one of the tracks with a light-hearted race against one another, with Marco, the 28-year-old current IndyCar star, beating his grandfather and his father, Michael.“Usually, when you go to race go-karts it’s in a warehouse, but when you come here, you get to entertain the family and have great racing, which is what we love to do,” John Andretti added.The Marietta location, which will employ approximately 300 people, complements a Roswell facility that opened in 2001. It cost an estimated $15 million to transform the building that housed a Burlington Coat Factory.“Studies were done for where the next location was going to go, and the demographics here just fit,” Michael said. “It matched up well. The right backing came in and we got it up and running.”“We have somewhere around 450 employees between the two locations,” John added. “We’re very proud of it and what it can bring to the community. It’s exciting and fun for the whole family. You can come here and chill out or get that big adrenaline rush with the racing.”There are three go-kart racing tracks available, including a track for children, an intermediate track and a track for teens and one for adults. The electric cars have a maximum speed of 35 mph, but are adjusted depending on the track a person is racing. Solar panels on the roof help to provide battery charges for the card.“We’re really excited and proud to be a part of this,” Michael Andretti said. “This is first-class, all the way from the tracks and the gaming and the banquet facility. I want the residents here to be proud of it, too, and to have a good time. If they come in and give it a chance, I think they’ll like it a lot.“We’re proud of what we’ve been able to do with our brand. There are so many of us in our family that race, it’s great that we can do something together that all of us will enjoy, and this place, I think, can also provide that for the families in the area.”Several big-screen TVs are located at the end of the bowling lanes, and nearly 40 TVs are located in a bar that provides views of the race tracks. There are roughly 115 games on the floor, including a 3D interactive shooting game and a racing simulator. The laser tag and race tracks occupy two levels.“The food is phenomenal,” John said. “It’s gourmet food here. You can bring a date here and be treated to a great evening out, and you don’t even have to go-kart. We promote an atmosphere where everybody’s welcome, and the meeting rooms are good for team-building exercises, birthday parties and special events. We can cater meals to fit your event.“As a family, it was important for us to be able to fill a lot of different needs with this place, and it was important for all of us to be here to showcase that.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:58:52.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
