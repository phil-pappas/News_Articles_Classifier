The NFC East is still wide open and a win for the Burgundy and Gold could keep them in the thick of the race for the division crown. \nWe take a look at the key match ups going into Sunday's tilt with the Eagles: \nKirk Cousins vs. Sam Bradford \nSunday's forecast is calling for rain thanks to Hurricane Joaquin, meaning the usually sloppy playing surface of FedEx Field will be especially volatile, making the turnover battle extremely important. Cousins and Bradford have each had their ups and downs this season so far. \nCousins showed signs of stability against the Rams, a game which he managed beautifully, making good decisions and not costing his team the win with bad interceptions. But the old Cousins resurfaced against the Giants last week. Cousins was picked off twice, both being throws that he tried to force into tight windows. \nSam Bradford has been just as shaky as Cousins, showing brilliance at sometimes (see second half against Atlanta in week one), but then disappearing for long stretches of time (see entire game against Dallas in week 2). So far, the Eagles' offense is a far cry from the high-flying juggernaut it was supposed to be and Bradford shoulders not all, but part of the blame. \nSunday's game could be decided by one errant throw or one wise check down instead of heaving a prayer into double coverage. The question is: Who will make more good decisions? Cousins or Bradford? \nRedskins Special Teams vs. Darren Sproles \nThe Redskins' special teams unit has been woeful this year, allowing a punt return touchdown in week one and having a punt blocked for a safety last week against the Giants. Sure, Rashad Ross had a beautiful 101-yard kickoff return touchdown against the Giants, but by then, the game was out of hand. \nJay Gruden continues to bring up the losses of key special teamers Niles Paul and Adam Hayward, citing their absence as one of the main reasons special teams have been so dreadful. But this is a \"next man up\" league and it's time for players to start making plays. \nThings don't get easier when Philly rolls into town with Darren Sproles, one of the leagues best return men. Sproles had an electrifying punt return touchdown last week against the New York Jets, a play that jump started the Eagles' victory. \nSpecial teams have let the Redskins down this season. Another lackluster performance from the unit could send the Redskins to the NFC East cellar. Containing Sproles will be key, but every player on Washington's special teams needs to make sure they have the New England Patriots' mantra in mind: \"Do your job.\" \nLike this story?
