It's funny that a game here can get all the way to Australia, but it did.\"\nHe said his instincts from playing Australian rules football kicked in, leading to him trying to punt the ball over his head after losing control of it.\n\"We're taught to pick it up and move it on,\" O'Neill said. \"That's completely on me.\"\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh said after the game that he wished O'Neill would have fallen on the football, leaving Michigan State with an attempted Hail Mary to win the game.\nO'Neill, though, said no one has ever told him to do that if he bobbled the snap because you plan and practice to make plays the right way.\n\"That's the best way to play you can play football is be optimistic,\" he said.\nWhen mistakes are made, O'Neill said football is like life.\n\"You learn from it so you can do better,\" he said. \"You pick yourself up, dust yourself off and move on.\"\nSure, Harbaugh plays the what-if game.\nThe Michigan coach acknowledged Tuesday that running the ball on sweeps toward the sideline to take more time off the clock was something he considered on first, second and third down in the final minutes against Michigan State.\n\"You'd love to have that opportunity to do it again to see how the other way worked,\" Harbaugh said.\nThe Wolverines handed the ball off to De'Veon Smith three times and he gained 8 yards. On the pivotal drive that ended with a botched punt, Smith slightly surpassed his average per carry on 19 rushing attempts Saturday.\nThat left Michigan with a fourth-and-2 at the Michigan State 47 with 10 seconds left, which was just enough time for the Spartans to win. The Spartans rushed O'Neill with 10 players and sent no one back to field the potential kick. In the end, it didn't matter.\n\"I would consider it more of a miracle than a fluke,\" Wolverines offensive lineman Graham Glasgow said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:35:55.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
