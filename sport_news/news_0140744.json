Green in the end zone.\nThis also was just Dalton's second interception all season; both have come in the end zone.\n- Joe Kay reporting from Cincinnati\n___\n1:50 p.m.\nEagles quarterback Sam Bradford's passes keep getting caught in the end zone - but the problem is that the Saints are the ones hauling in the football.\nThe Eagles had a first down at New Orleans' 12 when Bradford was picked off by Brandon Browner in the end zone.\nAfter Drew Brees took advantage of the turnover by throwing a TD pass for a 7-0 lead, Philadelphia's next possession ended this way: Devin Breaux intercepted Bradford's pass from the 14 - yep, you got it - in the end zone.\n- Rob Maaddi reporting from Philadelphia\n___\n1:30 p.m.\nAaron Rodgers just threw an interception at Lambeau Field.\nRepeat: Aaron Rodgers just threw an interception at Lambeau field.\nHadn't happened in nearly three full years - since Dec. 2, 2012, when Vikings safety Harrison Smith picked him off on a flea-flicker.\nBut in the first quarter of the Packers' game against the visiting Rams on Sunday, a throw by two-time NFL MVP Rodgers was tipped at the line and linebacker James Laurinaitis made a diving catch for the interception.\n___\n1:20 p.m.\nSo it IS possible to score a touchdown against Seattle's defense.\nCincinnati quickly ended the Seahawks' streak of not allowing a TD over their opponents' last 20 offensive series.\nAndy Dalton led Cincinnati 86 yards in seven plays after the opening kickoff, hitting an uncovered Tyler Eifert for an 11-yard touchdown pass.\nSeattle's D had allowed a grand total of only one field goal in the previous 20 offensive series, a run that started during a loss to Green Bay in Week 2 and covered victories over Chicago in Week 3 and Detroit in Week 4.\n- Joe Kay reporting from Cincinnati\n___\n1:10 p.m.\nBills wide receiver Marcus Easley just saved Bishop Sankey and the Tennessee Titans from an ugly mistake to open their game.\nSankey muffed the kickoff, and the Titans were lucky that Craig Stevens recovered the ball at the Tennessee 2 - even though a couple of Bills thought they recovered the ball.\nStill, what could have been a big play to open the game for Rex Ryan's Bills turned into just the latest Buffalo bungle on a penalty call, because an official threw a flag to call Easley for being offside on the kickoff.\nThat forced another kick, and the Titans started their first drive at their own 23 rather than the 2.\n- Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville, Tenn.\n___\n9:15 a.m.\nJacksonville Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas is expected to make his season debut at Tampa Bay.\nThe team says Thomas is \"likely\" to play against the Buccaneers (1-3) on Sunday.\nThomas practiced this week without a cast for the first time since breaking his right hand in the preseason opener Aug. 14. He had surgery Sept. 2.\nThomas caught 108 passes and 24 touchdowns the last two years in Denver. He signed a five-year, $46 million contract with Jacksonville in free agency in March.\nThe Jaguars (1-3) expect Thomas, when fully healthy, to be a significant part of the passing game. They need a proven playmaker to help take some pressure off second-year receivers Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n All rights reserved.
