His quarterback ranking of 123 trails only that of Aaron Rodgers, and he's been more catalyst than caretaker for the NFL's second-ranked offense.\nA solid performance and win against the Seahawks' second-ranked defense would legitimize Dalton's progress and send the Bengals to a 5-0 start. A loss would resurface doubts that have followed Dalton, whose career has been marked by flops against the NFL's elite.\nUSA TODAY SPORTS WIRE\nUSA TODAY Sports' Week 5 NFL picks\nSome of Dalton's success this season can be credited to an offensive line, which has kept away the pressure that previously unraveled the quarterback. But Dalton's decision-making is also faster and better than ever. That will be paramount against a Seahawks defensive line that has shaken opposing signal-callers even when it hasn't sacked them.\nDalton will have to be careful testing the \"Legion of Boom\" secondary, but one of his biggest strides this season has been in the deep passing game. The Bengals seek out opportunities to gain yards in chunks, and they should pick their spots on Sunday.\nOutside of the passing game, Cincinnati appears to have the pieces in place to beat Seattle. The running game, powered by Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard, can carry the offense in stretches. A deep receiving corer (A.J. Green, Marvin Jones, Mohamed Sanu and tight end Tyler Eifert) can challenge the Seahawks secondary. And a strong defensive line should create problems for a Seattle offense missing Marshawn Lynch.\nOnce again for the Bengals, it all comes down to Dalton.\nHere are four other matchups that could define Week 4 in the NFL:\nTodd Gurley could be a centerpiece of the Rams offense. (Photo: Rick Scuteri, AP)\nSt. Louis Rams RB Todd Gurley vs. Green Bay Packers front seven\nUnder Jeff Fisher, the Rams have developed a reputation for being an inconsistent team capable of playing up to the level of top competition. Ending the Packers' 11-game home win streak, however, would solidify them as a potential playoff contender.\nSt. Louis' defensive line has become its signature, with defensive tackle Aaron Donald emerging as a front-runner for all-pro honors in just his second season. Yet one of the Rams' biggest assets in stopping the Packers might be on their offense.\nGurley paced an efficient yet opportunistic attack with 146 yards on 19 carries in last week's win over the Arizona Cardinals. A similar performance will be needed to keep Rodgers and the Packers offense, which ranks second in time of possession, off the field.\nGreen Bay has kept opposing running games in check by building big leads, but the defense has allowed 4.8 yards per carry. Inside linebacker Nate Palmer has to prove he's not a liability as a fill-in for Sam Barrington.\nUSA TODAY\nPelissero: Greg Hardy still brings big value to Cowboys\nTennessee Titans QB Marcus Mariota vs. Buffalo Bills defensive line\nThe Bills' uneven defense hasn't lived up to Rex Ryan's standards, but the group has confidence heading into its matchup with the rookie Mariota.\n\"I donâ€™t think the kid's gonna have his way against us,\" Ryan said Wednesday.\nMariota shows impressive patience and willingness to hang in the pocket, but he'll need a quick trigger against Buffalo. The Titans line has been shaky in pass protection, and it hasn't faced the likes of Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus yet.\nThe Bills likely will stick to their blitz-heavy ways and seeking to rattle Mariota with different looks. That could provide big-yardage opportunities, but only if Mariota can keep plays alive.\nUSA TODAY\nAfter nearly 20 years, Peyton Manning and Charles Woodson still going strong\nOakland Raiders WR Amari Cooper vs. Denver Broncos CB Aqib Talib\nCooper will be in for the toughest matchup of his early career against the Broncos cornerbacks, whether he draws Talib, Chris Harris or Bradley Roby.\nThe Raiders will need their standout rookie to have a big day against the league's top-ranked pass defense. Oakland's offensive line has held its own in protecting Derek Carr, but no unit has kept Broncos pass rushers DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller under control for a full game this year.\nCarr could focus on targeting Cooper early after turning away from him late in last week's loss to the Chicago Bears. But the Broncos defense is not afraid to gamble and has 11 takeaways this season.\nStill, there's reason to believe that Cooper can put a dent in Denver's chances if given the opportunity. Rookie receiver Stefon Diggs of the Minnesota Vikings posted six catches for 87 yards last week and positioned himself well against the Broncos' secondary.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 5 fantasy football rankings\nSan Francisco 49ers RB Carlos Hyde vs. New York Giants front seven\nColin Kaepernick's struggles have infected the 49ers offense, making life difficult for Hyde in what seemed like a possible breakout season.\nSince running for 168 yards and two touchdowns in the season-opening win over the Vikings, Hyde has rushed for a combined 114 yards in his last three games. A diminished workload and stacked boxes are holding Hyde back from fulfilling his role as a feature back.\nSunday presents a significant challenge for the 49ers: The Giants defense ranks first in rushing yards allowed per game (69.8) but last in passing yards allowed (316). There might be a natural inclination to exploit that weakness and build confidence for Kaepernick, but that's still a risky proposition for San Francisco.\nThe Giants might not need to stack the box against the 49ers. But their pass rush could be in trouble with linebacker Devon Kennard and defensive ends Robert Ayers and George Selvie out.\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz .\nPHOTOS: Week 5 games ranked by watchability\n14.
