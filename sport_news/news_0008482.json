Everybody buys into what Michael wants to do and now we've got the chance to play in a major tournament,\" he said. \n\"That's what you dream of as young boy watching those competitions on the TV. \n\"That's something we're going to be a part of now. It's something I'm personally very proud of. \n\"I've been available for every game in qualifying and for the manager to pick me each time means I must be doing something right.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:00:58.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
