Dave Dombrowski’s first order of business upon taking over as president of baseball operations was to observe every player and staff member, and he arrived with few preconceived opinions.\nOn his first full day on the job, Dombrowski mentioned shortstop Xander Bogaerts, outfielder Mookie Betts and rookie catcher Blake Swihart as foundational pieces. He joked that the Sox “will win a lot of games when we throw Rodriguez in 162,” a nod to promising young lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. And of course, he recognized David Ortiz and Dustin Pedroia as team leaders and champions.\nEveryone else? The slate started out as blank as the legal pad Dombrowski carried with him to jot notes over the next seven weeks.\nNow that the season is over, though, it’s worth considering who among the rest of the roster left the best and worst impressions on the new boss.\nOn the rise\n1. Travis Shaw: Nobody needed to make the 25-year-old first baseman aware of the opportunity that awaited him after the Sox traded Mike Napoli to Texas on Aug. 7.\n“This is as good of an audition as you can ask for,” Shaw said before making the absolute most of it by hitting 11 home runs and slugging .495 over his final 188 at-bats and all but erasing an underwhelming first half in Triple A.\nThere’s a risk in committing to Shaw for next season. His numbers through 65 big league games (.274/.331/.491, 13 homers) are similar to Will Middlebrooks’ at the same point (.301/.331/.525, 13 homers). And everyone is familiar with the ex-Sox third baseman’s career trajectory.\nBut Shaw represents one solution at first base if Dombrowski somehow can trade Hanley Ramirez. At the very least, he’d be a useful left-handed bat off the bench.\n2. Joe Kelly: A self-proclaimed lover of power pitching, Dombrowski must’ve been smitten.\nKelly posted a 2.35 ERA over his final eight starts, a reversal of fortune for the 27-year-old right-hander, who was so bad through the season’s first half he was banished to Triple A.\nTo be fair, the best explanation for Kelly’s resurgence was a willingness to throw more curveballs and changeups, a sign of his maturity as a pitcher. But his fastball still climbed into the high 90s, leaving him with the fourth-best average velocity (95.5) among AL pitchers who threw at least 100 innings.\nAnd although a bout with shoulder inflammation cheated Kelly out of three more starts, he might have done enough to earn a spot in a Dombrowski-designed rotation.\n3. Jackie Bradley Jr.: For three weeks after Dombrowski took over, the 25-year-old outfielder went 23-for-55 with 14 extra-base hits, part of a 25-game surge in which he batted .446 with an otherworldly 1.441 OPS.\nAs first impressions go, it doesn’t get better.\nAnd while Bradley’s season-ending 11-for-80 funk — combined with a .188 average through his first 537 career at-bats — creates questions about whether his streak was only a month-long aberration, he remains an elite defender, one Dombrowski seems to prefer in center field.\nConsidering Dombrowski tried to trade for Bradley last winter with the Tigers before winding up getting center fielder Anthony Gose from Toronto instead, it seems like a safe bet that JBJ is in his plans again.\nLook out below\n1. Rusney Castillo: A year after he signed a $72.5 million contract, raise your hand if you know whether the Cuban outfielder is a reliable everyday player.\nAnyone?\nThe Sox can’t possibly be sure either.\nOn the plus side, Castillo hit .338 with an .894 OPS in August and adapted well to left field, taming the Green Monster with ease. But like Bradley, he slumped after August, batting .194 with a .489 OPS. And while his athleticism is evident, his instincts on the bases and occasionally in the field remain raw.\nAt 28, it’s possible Castillo won’t get better, which must leave the Sox wondering if they can do better.\n2. Junichi Tazawa: It was bad enough the 29-year-old proved again that he doesn’t have what it takes to be a closer by blowing two saves (and nearly squandering a third) in August after Koji Uehara broke his wrist.\nBut the workload over the past three seasons took such a toll on Tazawa that he was cooked by the beginning of September, leading the Sox to shut him down.\nDombrowski has surely seen enough of Tazawa over the years (his work in the 2013 AL Championship Series against Detroit was exemplary) that the right-hander figures to still be part of the redesigned 2016 bullpen. But Tazawa’s struggles down the stretch, and the fact Uehara is coming off an injury and will turn 41 in April, only reinforce how much late-inning help the Red Sox need.\n3. Hanley Ramirez: From a distance, Dombrowski admits he was skeptical last winter when almost everyone assumed Ramirez would be able to play left field. It’s difficult to imagine he’s overly confident in the slugger moving to first base without having seen it in a game.\nRamirez played only seven games — six in left field, one at DH — in the Dombrowski era before succumbing to a strained right shoulder that ended his season. And while he took practice reps at first base, it’s hardly the same as proving he can play the position at game speed.\nAnd so, before penciling in Ramirez at another new position, Dombrowski figures to explore ways to unload him, possibly even taking on another team’s bad contract. Would the Padres, for example, take Ramirez for starter James Shields or outfielders Matt Kemp or Melvin Upton?\nIt’s worth asking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:20:49.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
