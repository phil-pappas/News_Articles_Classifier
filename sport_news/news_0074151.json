It was a good win for us.\"\nHarriman will play host to Greenback (6-2, 4-0) for the region championship on Friday night.\n\"Greenback has an excellent program and a really good football team,\" Tapp said. \"They have so many athletes over there, and then (Josh Silvey), their big lineman. It's going to be tough.\"\nGreene, 6-foot-1, 195 pounds, had a run of 75 yards for a touchdown. He has 1,096 rushing yards this season and more than 4,000 for his career.\n\"He's a very strong kid who works out hard and stays in the weight room,\" Tapp said of Greene. \"Then he has speed in the open field. He can run. The best thing about Garrett Greene is he's a real good young man. He's a guy the young kids look up to.\"\nJunior T.J. Phipps had 16 carries for 96 yards and two touchdowns against Oneida.\nTapp said he had film of three Oneida games and only saw the Indians' defense give up six points.\n\"Oneida always has a really good defensive team,\" Tapp said. \"I'm really proud we were able to move the ball against them. We hadn't seen it done on film. Going over there, we knew it would be up to our guys up front, and they played real well.\n\"We knew it would be tough. The guys ran hard, they got great blocking, and we played good defense.\"\nHarriman linemen John Langley, Treyton Peters, Hunter Clark, and Adam Brock played both offense and defense.\nJunior Hunter Davis earned a start on the defensive line during the week's practice and may have earned a job.\n\"(Davis) worked so hard in practice that he earned a shot, and he played real well on the defensive front,\" Tapp said.\nOneida was held to 176 yards.\nGreene and Joe Pace had interceptions, and Phipps had two sacks and numerous tackles.\nHarriman's offense controlled the ball and gave the defense plenty of rest.\n\"We were in a zone running it,\" Tapp said. \"When you run the ball and run the clock and keep your defense off the field, that's a pretty good defense in itself. We were able to do that.\"\nGreenback's Shutout: Junior running back Kayne Roberts rushed for 117 yards and five touchdowns as Greenback beat Midway 46-0 and set up Fridays' showdown against Harriman.\nThe Cherokees rushed for 188 yards, and junior quarterback Hunter Willis completed 7 of 14 passes for 166 yards and two touchdowns and played a key role at safety/outside linebacker.\nTavin Kilpatrick had a 41-yard touchdown catch and Breeden Gilbert a 24-yard touchdown catch.\n\"We do our best to be balanced (offensively),\" Greenback coach Brent Kilpatrick said. \"Coach (Greg) Ryan calls all the plays, and he takes what the defense gives us.\"\nRyan is co-head coach with Kilpatrick in addition to being offensive coordinator. Brian Hanley is Greenback's defensive coordinator.\nSilvey, a junior transfer from Catholic, had 10 tackles and three tackles for loss.\n\"He's been big all year for us,\" Kilpatrick said of Silvey. \"He's a pretty dominant interior lineman.\"\nSenior middle linebacker Javen Harris had eight tackles, and Kilpatrick had five tackles and two tackles for loss.\nThe Cherokees will face a big test next week at Harriman.\n\"It's always a good matchup,\" Kilpatrick said. \"Travis (Tapp) and his staff do a great job. They're a physical team. It will probably the toughest game for us and should be a good atmosphere.\"\nOakdale Gets Home Playoff Game: Junior Austin Helton threw three touchdown passes as Oakdale (5-3, 2-1 Region 1-1A) beat Unaka 40-18 and earned its first home playoff game in school history.\nOakdale also is making its first back-to-back playoff appearances. The Eagles have been in the state playoffs four times (1993, '96, '14-15).\n\"I'm tickled to death for the kids and I'm glad they're getting to see some fruits of all their labor,\" Oakdale coach J.R. Voyles said. \"It's good to see them getting some payback for all their hard work.\"\nJunior Austin Lowe had 160 yards on three kickoff returns and had a 95-yard return for touchdown against Unaka (1-2, 1-7).\nLowe had 150 receiving yards and two TD catches. Caleb Ritter had the other TD catch from Helton.\nThe Eagles had 380 yards out of the no-huddle spread offense.\nDefensive leaders for Oakdale were senior linebacker Colton Ritter — twin brother of Caleb — and senior defensive end Christian Cofer, who also plays running back.\nAfter a non-region game against Sale Creek on Friday, Oakdale finishes the regular season against Concord Christian (0-7, 0-3) on Oct. 30.\nOakdale finished 6-5 last season after a 42-28 loss at Sunbright in the first round of the Class A playoffs.\n\"We returned quite a few kids, but had to replace a lot of depth and experience on the line,\" Voyles said. \"We felt like we would have a chance to be competitive. We started out a little rough, but we're starting to come together and get it going.\"\nRegion 2-5A Race: While West (7-1, 4-0 Region 2-5A) clinched the No. 1 seed in region with Friday's 21-20 victory over visiting Heritage, the No. 2 spot and region's other home-field advantage for the first round of the playoffs won't be decided until the last week of the regular season.\nHeritage (3-5, 3-1) will play host to Halls (4-4, 3-1) on Oct. 30 for second place in the district.\nEach has non-region games on Friday with Heritage playing host to Clinton and Halls playing host to rival Karns.\nHeritage, making its first playoff appearance since 1999, drove 64 yards in the last two minutes Friday at West and tied the game on Dustin Richardson's screen pass for touchdown to Colton Wright on fourth-and-8.\nAfter an excessive celebration penalty, Richardson's pass for the two-point conversion was incomplete with no time on the clock.\n\"This is a growing process,\" fourth-year Heritage coach Tim Hammontree said. \"This is the fourth year developing winning attitudes. The competition in itself, being in this game and doing this, it's going to help us in a playoff situation. This is the best game we could of possibly had to get us ready for the first round.\"\nDave Link is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:41:24.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
