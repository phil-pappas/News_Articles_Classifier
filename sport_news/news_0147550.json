I won't go to the cinema again, that wasn't a very sensible choice last time because I picked the wrong film. \n\"It was 'Everest' - a story about a man going to the top of the mountain. A big storm comes and he dies!\" \nNo host nation has failed to reach the knockout phase and defeat to Australia could have damaging repercussions for Lancaster, his coaching lieutenants and Rugby Football Union chief executive Ian Ritchie. \nThe stakes are impossibly high as England seek to record a third successive victory over an Australia team that won this summer's Rugby Championship and Lancaster knows the moment must be seized. \n\"My final words to the players will be do it for everyone,\" head coach Lancaster said. \n\"To do it for the rugby clubs, the mums and dads and kids who play rugby, for their families, for the former players. \n\"But ultimately, I'll tell them to do it for themselves. They are the ones who have put the graft in, they are the ones who have to sit in the changing room before the game. \n\"We have some brilliant players. They are brilliant players now, but are only going to get better in the future. This is a big moment for them. For all of us.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:35:55.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
