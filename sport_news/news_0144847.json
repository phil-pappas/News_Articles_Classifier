There is nothing they can do to change the fact that Grier is ineligible after taking an over-the-counter supplement that contained a substance banned by the NCAA. Getting that news on Monday came as No. 11 Florida (6-0, 3-0 SEC) prepares to travel to No. 5 LSU (5-0, 3-0) on Saturday.\nPart of that is likely because sophomore Treon Harris, who will replace Grier, might not fit the typical expectations of a back-up quarterback.\n\"Sitting out practice in fall camp seeing them both compete, it was awesome,\" said linebacker Jarrad Davis. \"We knew we had something either way.\"\nTo be sure, moving forward without Grier is a loss and one that came as a surprise to the players who assembled for a team meeting Monday. Afterward, Grier and first-year coach Jim McElwain addressed the media.\nGrier had led Florida to a surprising 6-0 start – completing 106 of 161 passes for 1,204 yards, 10 touchdowns and three interceptions – with a comeback win against Tennessee and a rout of then-No. 4 Ole Miss a week later on Oct. 3.\nHe will not be eligible to return until the seventh game of the 2016 season, barring a successful appeal. Though he is able to practice, Grier cannot travel with the team.\n\"As the quarterback of an SEC program, especially like this, you accept the responsibility,\" said tight end Jake McGee. \"If something happens, you have to own it. I think he's done a great job of getting through this.\"\nPlayers voiced their support for Grier on Tuesday but maintained a focus on the challenge ahead. The defense will have its hands full enough with Heisman Trophy favorite Leonard Fournette, who has more than 1,000 yards and 12 touchdowns in five games.\nBut Harris' turn under center does not represent a break for the Tigers' defense, which has faced a back-up quarterback in each of the past three games.\nHarris takes over after playing in four games this season, entering mostly on run plays after starting the opener and splitting time the first two games. He was suspended for a violation of team rules for the Sept. 26 game against Tennessee.\n\"(Treon) is a guy that I don't think there'll be much of a drop-off,\" said McGee. \"He's a big-time player.\"\nHarris started the final six games last season after being suspended in October 2014 for a rape allegation for which he was not charged. He was an SEC All-Freshman selection after throwing for 1,019 yards and nine touchdowns.\nHis experience as a true freshman included a comeback win at Tennessee, during which he led two fourth-quarter scoring drives, and a win against Georgia. That will help, said offensive lineman Trip Thurman.\n\"We won't skip a beat,\" he said.\nHarris gives the Gators more of a running threat at the position than Grier, so holding blocks longer to open holes will be important, Thurman said. Otherwise, little will be different.\n\"It kind of helps the run game because your D-line coach is telling you all week, 'This guy can hurt us with his legs. We've got to contain him,'\" said defensive lineman Jonathan Bullard. \"And you don't take as many shots as you would against a guy who you probably can catch from behind. So I think their D-line is going to have to really stay in their gap and kind of close the pocket on Treon, cause now he can pull it down and take off and go all the way.\"\nIf the Gators are concerned about the shake-up at quarterback, they didn't show it. The quarterback competition that raised so many questions at the start of the season might be the best thing to sustain them in light of Grier's suspension.\n\"We already know what we can do,\" said Davis. \"I was kind of surprised that he wasn't starting this year, but at the same time coach makes those decisions. He picked the right guy, and now it's time for Treon to step up and take that spot back and charge on.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:39:28.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
