Arrieta and Watson exchanged words near home plate and the bullpens and benches briefly emptied onto the field. The teams gathered around each other along the first base line but there were no punches thrown. Watson was issued a warning. \nPittsburgh utility player Sean Rodriguez was ejected. Rodriguez took his frustration out on a water cooler in the Pirates' dugout, landing a couple of good blows in anger. \nArrieta hit two Pirates earlier in the game, though neither appeared intentional. \nThe Cubs were leading 4-0 at the time of the dustup. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:58:39.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
