They have showed that a lot of times. \n\"I think Arsenal are one of the best teams in the league, in a technical and tactical sense - maybe the best. I like the way they play. \n\"Nevertheless, they haven't won so much so you have to look for that improvement with their team.\" \nVan Gaal has expressed concerns about his own side - who played their Champions League game this week on Wednesday, beating Wolfsburg 2-1 - being affected by fatigue. \nAnd he said: \"It is very difficult and Arsenal had also one day more because they played the day before us so it shall be a difficult game.\" \nThe Dutchman has also stressed the need for United themselves to get better, despite Wednesday's victory being their fourth in a row in all competitions. \nHe added: \"We can improve and we have to show it against Arsenal, it is not an easy match but we have to show it.\" \nAlthough they have been winning and risen to the Premier League summit, questions over United's performances have not gone away. \nRed Devils midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin earlier this week suggested the team are starting to silence the doubters. \nBut United defender Phil Jones feels there will always be critical voices and is happy that he and his team-mates have been able to surprise people by climbing to top spot. \n\"It (being top) is a great boost for us and it raises a few eyebrows,\" Jones said. \n\"Hopefully we can keep raising a few more because our results and performances have been very good this season and hopefully we can keep it going. \n\"When we were winning games, it was never enough goals - it was 4-0, we should have won 10-0. \n\"You always get that. They are there to make judgemental comments.\" \nJones says United will go to Arsenal \"confident\" and is personally hoping to get a decent amount of game time. \nThe 23-year-old England international has been eased into his comeback from thrombosis, making substitute appearances in each of United's last three games. \nAnd he said: \"Having had what I have had, it was the wisest decision. \n\"On a number of occasions when I have been injured I have come straight back and been thrown in and it has been difficult. \n\"But I am fit now, I am itching to play and hopefully I can be a part of it.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:35:44.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
