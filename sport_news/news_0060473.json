Could you please get the recipe? — James Lord, Dublin\nAdrienne Harris Horseradish Grill’s Succotash and Biscuits. Adrienne Harris / AJC file A: Steve Alterman, proprietor of Horseradish Grill, sent his thanks to our readers for their interest in recipes steeped in Southern tradition. …\nThe author of the succotash recipe was the restaurant’s third chef, Tom McEachern. The restaurant has a garden in its backyard, and McEachern asked the gardener to plant lady peas. “She did and they arrived that summer about five years ago with a vengeance (which is to say, all at once). We had to cook them or lose them, so Tom found a recipe that dates to at least 1929, and it complemented our horseradish-crusted grouper, so it stuck, ” Alterman wrote.\nThe restaurant serves succotash in the summer when the peas are fresh, but you can use frozen peas if you start to crave succotash out of season. “Fresh lady peas and other shelled peas are not cheap, and they are sometimes difficult to find. Their growing season is right in the heart of summer, and usually can be found at roadside stands from late May through August, ” Alterman wrote. In season, fresh shelled summer peas also can be found at local farmers markets and at the State Farmers Market in Forest Park.\nHorseradish Grill’s Succotash\n1 pound lady peas, small limas or crowder peas\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n4 ears fresh corn, husked, kernels cut from cob\n1 small onion, diced\n1 teaspoon minced garlic\n1 small red bell pepper, diced\n2 tablespoons chopped parsley\nIn a medium saucepan, cover peas with water and add salt.
