De Groote West Hawaii Today \nAfter reeling off convincing wins in the semifinals, Konawaena and Kamehameha meet up for the second consecutive year in the BIIF Division II championship on Friday. \nThe Warriors are the defending champions and won the regular season matchup 24-0, but are on the road to take on a hungry Wildcat squad. \nThe title bout will feature two outstanding sophomore quarterbacks, stingy defenses and a talented cast of other playmakers. Here is a position-by-position breakdown of the BIIF Division II championship to see who has the edge: \nQuarterback \nKonawaena sophomore Austin Ewing has played outstanding this season, passing for 1,469 yards and 19 touchdowns. More impressively, the young quarterback has thrown just two interceptions, showing good judgment and making plays when pressured. \nAn injury kept Ewing out when the teams met up in the regular season, but he will be entering with major momentum this time around. In his first taste of playoff action as the starter, Ewing tossed for five scores against Honokaa in the semifinals last weekend. \nKamehameha quarterback DallasJ Duarte has been no slouch either. The sophomore has 22 touchdown strikes on the year and is fresh off a four touchdown (3 passing, 1 rushing) performance last week against Hawaii Prep. \nEdge : Konawaena \nRunning back \nKaeo Batacan has been the workhorse for Kamehameha all year, and he showed up in a big way against the Wildcats in the regular season. Batacan carried the ball 40 times, racking up 100 yards and two touchdowns. \nHe has had three touchdowns on three different occasions this season, and averages well over 20 touches per game. Batacan’s best asset as a runner is his persistence. The 5-foot-6 back can handle hits and doesn’t get flustered when he gets held up for small gains. He has the speed and vision to score at any time. \nOn the Wildcats side, it’s the two-headed attack of Algene Kelekolio and Micah Laban leading the way. Kelekolio has done most of the damage, finding the end zone 13 times and has three 100-yard games this season. Laban has chipped in 305 yards and three touchdowns. \nEdge : Too close to call \nWide receiver \nBoth team’s sophomore quarterback success stories have been helped by talented pass-catchers. \nFour Warrior wide receivers have at least four touchdowns and 300 yards. Tre Evans-Dumaran and Makana Manoa each have five touchdown snags, while Kainalu Whitney leads the teams with 31 catches and 420 yards. Returning All-BIIF selection Bayley Manliguis has come on strong late, including a three-touchdown performance in the semifinals against Hawaii Prep. \nKonawaena has a diverse group of wide receivers, all capable of turning short passes into huge gains. \nKamakana Ching has provided eight touchdowns and has a per-catch average just a shade over 20 yards. Tristan Fleming-Nazara is a big, consistent target for Ewing, hauling in 24 passes for three scores and just under 400 yards. \nKayson Mahiai and Cameron Howes are the playmakers out of the slot. The duo have combined for seven touchdowns this season, and both have scores over 60 yards. \nEdge : Konawaena \nOffensive line \nKonawaena came in uncertain of its offensive line unit and have been hampered by some injuries. However, the team has been pleasantly surprised by how the big ‘Cats have bullied opponents in the trenches, including a dominant performance against rival Kealakehe. \nKamehameha’s unit up front, led by Kelii Montibon and Joyden Madriaga, has worn down opponents and helped grind out wins. While a 40-carry game is a big load on a running back, the big guys up front have to have enough stamina and strength to consistently get off the ball and move opponents around. \nEdge : Kamehameha \nOverall offense \nKonawaena is determined to make up for the shut out loss earlier this season. Ewing being back and possibly some better weather will help that cause. \nKamehameha has posted an average of 45 points in three contests since that game, and enter with a big head of steam. \nIt’s close, but the edge goes to the determined and slightly more explosive Wildcats. \nDEFESNE \nDefensive line \nConverted linebacker Wayne Dacalio has been among the top pass-rushers in the BIIF for the Warriors. At 6-foot-4, 278 pounds, Nainoa Rosehill is the big man in the middle. \nIt’s a pick your poison type of situation for opponents when choosing who to double team against the Wildcats. \nAustin Santos-Johnson and Torin Tuppein have been nearly unblockable in the BIIF. Santos-Johnson has tallied 88 tackles — 25 for a loss — and 10 sacks. Tuppein has 74 tackles, 13 of those for a loss and a half-dozen sacks. Sophomore Paka Cacoulidis has also come on strong this season. \nEdge : Konawaena \nLinebackers \nKamehameha has a lot of playmakers at the linebacker position, which includes Iokua Manuia and Lukela Chin. The unit is the heart of a defense that didn’t allow a point against BIIF DII opponents in the regular season. \nBehind the aggressive front line for the Wildcats, Trey Basque (69 tackles), Logan Canda (62 tackles) and Phillip Grace (58 tackles) have been tackling machines. With Batacan probably getting a heavy workload, the trio need to make sure he doesn’t break through past the second level. \nEdge : Too close to call \nDefensive backs \nMahiai and Howes bring their playmaking skills to the defensive side of the ball as well for the Wildcats. The duo have three interceptions apiece this season. \nFor Kamehameha, the secondary has helped win the turnover battle in a lot of games this season. After forcing four interceptions against Konawaena — including two from sophomore DB Kailikea Kekuawela — the Warriors recorded six picks against Honokaa the following week. \nEdge : Konawaena \nOverall defense \nAlbeit the conditions weren’t ideal for Konawaeana in the regular season, but nonetheless, Kamehameha shut down and shut out the high-powered Wildcats. That’s something no other team in the BIIF can claim this season. \nMeanwhile, the Konawaena defense has churned out dominant performances on multiple occasions — including against Division I contenders Hilo and Kealakehe. The unit also very rarely gives up big plays. \nEdge: Too close to call \nSpecial teams \nIn a tight game, it may come down to which team makes a big play on special teams. \nManliguis is the big play returner for Kamehameha, and sparked the Warriors with an 87-yard kickoff return last week. \nIt’s been Howes and Mahiai with the momentum swinging plays on kick and punt returns for Konawaena. In the kicking game, freshman Harry Hill has surfaced as a consistent leg. \nEdge : Konawaena \nPapalii: Konawaena 24, Kamehameha 23 \nDe Groote: Konawaena 35, Kamehameha 24 Search Site", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:01:15.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
