The Irish proceeded to take command of the sixth annual Holy Bowl, using Montero’s pick to start their offense on the first of three second-quarter scoring drives and forcing the Jaguars to turn the ball over three more times in the fourth quarter, before the DeSales football team hoisted the prize trophy from its 34-13 win on a chilly Friday night at home. The Irish (2-5 overall, 1-1 in the Southeast 2B) avenged their loss in last year’s Holy Bowl at Pasco. “We started this game with a chip on our shoulder, and we used that chip very well,” said DeSales defensive end and punter Pat Elmenhurst, who earned the annual contest’s Sportsmanship Award. “We came out second half and knew that we needed to do, and we did it.” DeSales tailback John Crowley scored three touchdowns, all runs, as he totaled 148 yards on 17 carries, while quarterback Zach Leahy (6-foot-5) used his long strides to gain 121 yards on 21 rushes. Leahy also used his right arm to lead the DeSales passing attack, completing 10 of 18 attempts for 129 yards and a touchdown without an interception. He meanwhile, like Montero, was responsible for another one of the three INTs thrown by Jaguars quarterback Colin Dickson, setting up Crowley’s third touchdown in the final minute. “We were ecstatic, we had a lot of energy and that’s what defense needs,” Leahy said. “We went out and made plays, and that’s all you can ask for. Get the turnovers, get your offense on the field and have a chance to score. We did that.” DeSales’ Connor Hoeft made the other interception, less than a minute after he caught Leahy’s 38-yard scoring heave, putting the Irish lead up to 27-6. Until Montero’s interception in the second quarter, however, the quiet Irish seemed to brace themselves for disappointment. Losing the previous week at Waitsburg, their late rally denied at the hands of a goal-line stand by the Cardinals. Tri-Cities Prep marched onto Baffney Field amid Holy Bowl ceremonies and took the opening kickoff on a long, 15-play drive capped by Mario Valencia’s four-yard scoring run for a 6-0 lead less than six minutes in. By contrast, DeSales’ ensuing possession quickly fizzled after four snaps including a holding penalty and ended with an Elmenhurst punt. Their second drive needed a fourth-down conversation to stay alive, but Leahy fumbled the ball away at midfield and Tri-Cities started another drive at their 46-yard line, poised to deliver a stifling blow. “We played very well at times last week against Waitsburg and just couldn’t finish it at the goal line at the end of the game,” DeSales coach Mike Spiess said. “We as coaches were a little concerned that these kids had just kinda folded up after that, because that was a tough loss for us. “They came out, Tri-Cities Prep, and just boom-boom-boom right down the field on us. After the way last week’s game ended and this game started, that could have been the end of it for us.” A face-masking penalty against DeSales at the start of the second quarter helped the Jaguars advance to the DeSales 30, but on third-and-10, Dickson made his fifth pass attempt. Montero nabbed it, and the Irish took over. DeSales will next play Thursday at Asotin in the last game on their regular season schedules. “With this win here, we’re in good shape to play for a playoff berth,” Spiess said.
