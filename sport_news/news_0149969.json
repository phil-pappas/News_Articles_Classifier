He carried 17 times for 214 yards, scoring on runs of 5, 14 and 60 yards. The first was a dive over the pylon and the last a weaving long one, avoiding tackler after tackler while waiting patiently for every block along the way. Eau Gallie rolls in district victory \nASTRONAUT 15, ORLANDO JONES 14 \nIn Titusville, Astronaut gave its homecoming crowd every bit of their money’s worth Friday night, piecing together a late fourth quarter comeback and scoring on the last play of regulation to shock Jones High of Orlando. \nSophomore running back Javian Hawkins led the way for the War Eagles, carrying the ball the ball 23 times for 109 yards and two scores, the second being a 4-yard, go-ahead touchdown to cap off Astronaut’s 75-yard, game-winning drive in the game’s final two minutes. \nMCC 47, COCOA BEACH 8 \nIn Cocoa Beach, Joaquin Collazo threw for 179 yards and two touchdowns to lead MCC. \nMCC got on the scoreboard first as Greg Johanning was credited with a safety as he sacked Minutemen QB Mitchell Machock in the endzone on the Minutemen’s first possession of the game. \nLeading 2-0, the Hustlers then exploded for 21 points in the second quarter as Collazo connected with Josh Walts on a 13-yard pass play for the first touchdown of the game. \nOn the first play of the second quarter, the Hustlers’ Cameron Rivermonte and Nate Flemming combined to cause and recover a Minutemen fumble at the Cocoa Beach 14-yard line. The Hustlers quickly responded with a perfectly executed reverse play when running back Tqwuan Berkley pitched the ball to Reuben Carmona, who scored on a 14-yard run. \nHERITAGE 41, OKEECHOBEE 14 \nIn Palm Bay, Heritage trailed early, but it was only short-lived. \nJosh Gaines became the first running back in Heritage High history to run for 4,000 yards, gaining 172 in Friday night’s win. \nThe Panthers also garnered a big District 14-6A victory. \nGaines rushed for two touchdowns and caught a third. \nHOLY TRINITY 34, TRINITY CHRISTIAN 19 \nIn Deltona, Holy Trinity scored early and built from there for a win over Trinity Christian. \nEighth-grader Larry Hill went 80 yards on the second play of the game for a six-point lead. That gave head coach Nate Hooks pleasant feelings for two reasons. \n“We’re not going to be able to drive 80 yards on teams all the time, so we need more explosive plays,” he said. “I was pleased with that, and I was very, very pleased with our eighth- and ninth-graders. They’re so young and inexperienced, I don’t think they understand the importance of each win. They’re just going out and playing.” \nSophomore Jashaun Corbin had another big night. He ran for two touchdowns and passed for one on a Tigers fourth-down play. Holy Trinity cruises past Trinity Christian \nVIERA 49, MELBOURNE 3 \nIn Melbourne, Viera opened up defense of its Class 7A, District 6 championship with a big victory over the host Melbourne Bulldogs. \nSenior quarterback Hayden Kingston ran for a 15-yard score and threw for 220 yards and three touchdowns — two to Alex Cabrera — to lead the Viera offense. \nBrennen Deplancke also scored a touchdown and Tre Schaneville nailed a 31-yard field goal. \nViera’s defense, which got an interception from Jamyson Boyd, also recorded two safeties. \nMERRITT ISLAND 35, SATELLITE 0 \nIn Merritt Island, the Mustangs shut out Satellite on their Homecoming. \nOn the third play of the game, Merritt Island quarterback Jimmy Batch hit a streaking David Dufresne down the right sideline for a 39-yard touchdown. On their next drive, the Mustangs needed just two plays to go 62 yards, 57 of which were covered by Deben Peterson with a run to the outside on an option pitch. \nThe Mustangs ran 10 plays on its first three drives to score 21 points. \nMerritt Island’s defense also was stout. The Mustangs forced three turnovers in the first 24 minutes, including two interceptions by Sean Diggs and a blocked field goal. \nPALM BAY 45, TITUSVILLE 10 \nIn Titusville, Palm Bay combined to rush for 288 yards in a thumping of Titusville. \nPalm Bay’s fourth win in a row helped the Pirates retaine a share of the lead in District 14-5A at 2-0, with Merritt Island, a 35-0 winner over Satellite. The two will meet on Oct. 23. \nThe Pirates defense gave top Terriers rusher Jaleel Davis no room to maneuver, frequently meeting him in the backfield or at the line of scrimmage. They held him to 51 yards. \nBrian Lankford-Johnson led a varied Pirates attack with 176 yards on 18 rushes. He added a 67-yarder on the first play of the fourth period. Dez Arthur, who gained 54 on 10 carries, scored from the 2, and Jared Morris ended the scoring with a 17-yard run. Pirates roll on in District 14-5A \nSPACE COAST 29, ROCKLEDGE 28, OT \nIn Rockledge, Space Coast went for a 2-point conversion in overtime and made it, completing a comeback victory. \nThe thrilling victory capped a 14-point second half comeback for the young Vipers, who improve to 1-1 in Class 5A, District 14 play. \nIt was a devastating loss for Rockledge, whose playoff hopes are all but dashed with an 0-2 district record. \nThe Raiders led 21-14 late in the fourth quarter with the ball, and seemed to be in control, but a fumble on first down near midfield gave the Vipers another chance. \nAnd Space Coast converted that chance when sophomore quarterback Bradley Cantrell found standout receiver Jason Browning for a 14-yard touchdown pass with just under two minutes left to tie the game at 21. \nRockledge scored a touchdown on its first possession of overtime, but Space Coast quickly answered on Corn Fulton’s two-yard run. The Vipers initially lined up for an extra point attempt, but Rockledge jumped offside, and Space Coast decided to go for the win. \nOn that game-deciding play, Fulton took the handoff, bounced outside and stretched over the goal line for the conversion and the win. Vipers go for 2 in OT, nip Rockledge 29-28 \nMIC 29, FAITH CHRISTIAN (ORLANDO) 14 \nIn Merritt Island, Max Power had an eye for spotting holes in Faith Christian’s defense and sprinting for big yardage as Merritt Island Christian won on its homecoming Friday night. \nPower rushed 16 times for 214 yards and four touchdowns. He scored from 20, 50, 3 and 77 yards. \nWith 9:33 remaining in the fourth quarter, Power cut straight up the middle through the Lions’ defense for that 77-yard sprint into the endzone. He then rushed in the 2-point conversion to tally the final points for the night. Power leads Merritt Island Christian to victory \nCOCOA AT ST. EDWARD (OHIO), Saturday \nCocoa will play at 2 p.m. in Lakewood, Ohio, against St. Edward, the No. 24 team in this week’s USA Today Super 25. \nThe Tigers (4-1) have played games outside the state of Florida every year since 2010. That included a 24-14 win over Bergen Catholic (N.J.) in 2012. The Eagles (4-1) defeated the same Bergen team last week, 31-28. \nSt. Edward is the top-ranked team in the Cleveland Plain Dealer and Ohio Associated Press statewide rankings. The Eagles won the 2014 OHSAA Division I championship, its second state title. The team, which is 2-0 against teams from Florida, last played one, Thomas Jefferson, in 2011. \nSt. Edward is 3-0 at home this season and won all six home games last year. Running back Cole Gest averages 7.8 yards per carry, and quarterback Jimmy Keefe has passed for 835 yards and five touchdowns.
