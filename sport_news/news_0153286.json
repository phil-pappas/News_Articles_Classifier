(AP) - DeSoto County Schools is ready to take the wraps off its new vocational-technical center in Horn Lake with a ribbon-cutting Oct. 22.\nThe Commercial Appeal reports ( http://bit.ly/1ZBdTn1 ) the ceremony will officially mark completion of the project, part of the system's emphasis on providing a career path for students not interested in a traditional college-bound path out of high school.\nThe $12 million facility, known as Career Technology Center West, is on 70 acres at U.S. 51 and Nail Road in Horn Lake. It replaces a smaller vo-tech operation in Southaven High School, where the vacated space is being converted into classrooms for the high school and Southaven Middle School.\nThe new vo-tech facility offers programs in automotive, metal and welding, carpentry and culinary. It partners with Northwest Mississippi Community College.\nInformation from: The Commercial Appeal, http://www.commercialappeal.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
