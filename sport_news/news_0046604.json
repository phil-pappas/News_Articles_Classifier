But he got his hands on it against Arizona State at a critical moment in the role he has embraced and mastered: special-teams demon.\nVainuku is the captain of USC’s special teams. The Eureka High product attacks his job – which isn’t especially glamorous – with infectious energy and enthusiasm.\n“It’s awesome for our team,” Sarkisian said Tuesday after the first of two bye-week practices. “When you have a senior who’s giving himself up and committing himself to special teams … it just sends a great message to our entire team, our younger players, that it’s not always about the quantity of plays that you play but the quality.\n“Soma, when he’s been in the game, whether it’s on special teams or on offense, his quality of play has been really high.”\nVainuku has three tackles on special teams through four games and one critical fumble recovery. It happened late in the second quarter at ASU on Saturday, on the kickoff after Chris Hawkins’ fumble return for a touchdown. Quinton Powell stripped Sun Devils returner Gump Hayes at the 4-yard line. Vainuku pounced on the loose ball. Three plays later, Cody Kessler connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for a score to give the Trojans an insurmountable 35-0 lead.\nVainuku has accumulated 28 tackles and three blocked punts during his USC career, earning first-team All-Pac-12 honors in 2013 for his work on special teams.\n“It’s all a mindset,” Vainuku said. “I always tell the guys we’re the first play on defense; we’ve got to go out there and make a statement.”\nSaid special-teams coordinator Johnny Nansen: “He’s a team guy. Whatever role we give him, he does it to the fullest. It’s been a blessing.”\nDARNOLD’S DAY\nWith USC on a bye before facing Washington a week from Thursday, younger players received more reps in practice. They included freshman quarterback Sam Darnold, whose usual role is to run the scout team.\nThe San Clemente High product is redshirting this season but is trying to soak up as much as he can from veteran quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Browne.\n“Their habits, the way they study film is really the key thing,” Darnold said. “And also practice. They don’t take a day off at practice. In high school, I didn’t take a day off, but I kind of lounged around sometimes, kind of chilled. I know out here it’s a different story. I’ve gotta do my thing every day.”\nDarnold, who had an impressive training camp, threw a pair of touchdown passes during team drills.\nQUICK HITS\nSmith-Schuster, USC’s leading receiver, was not at practice because of “personal reasons,” Sarkisian said, adding: “We hope to have him back tomorrow. I don’t think it’s serious, but as we move forward, we’ll keep you guys up to date.” … Receiver Darreus Rogers also did not practice because of a hamstring injury suffered vs. Arizona State. Rogers spent the day rehabbing, Sarkisian said. … Cornerback Kevon Seymour (knee) didn’t do much work and appeared to be limping around. He has missed the past two games. … Nose tackle Antwaun Woods, who sat out the ASU game because of a shoulder injury, participated in team drills with the first-unit defense. … USC practiced in full pads and did a lot of inside running and hitting. The team did more 11-on-11 work than in a typical game-week practice. … USC running backs and offensive linemen ran extra sprints after the two-hour practice. … Offensive line coach Bob Connelly said ASU blitzed USC more than any defense he’s seen in 21 years of coaching.\nContact the writer: mlev@ocregister.com\nRelated: VIDEO: Sark on Darnold, bye week, running game Adoree' Jackson wows his USC teammates with spectacular plays USC needs post-loss approach to become constant VIDEO: USC-Arizona State afterthoughts", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/usc/usc-685157-constant-something.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/usc/latest-684898-state-trojan.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/jackson-684953-usc-play.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/usc/game-685213-whitney-darnold.html"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:15:51.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
