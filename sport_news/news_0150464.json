But we've sent him to see several doctors and they're all recommending he continue to throw.\" Duquette wants Orioles free agents back In an end-of-the-season press conference with Orioles Manager Buck Showalter, the team's vice president for baseball operations Dan Duquette said he would like to have free agents like Chris Davis, Wei Yin Chen and Darren O'Day back with the club next yea In an end-of-the-season press conference with Orioles Manager Buck Showalter, the team's vice president for baseball operations Dan Duquette said he would like to have free agents like Chris Davis, Wei Yin Chen and Darren O'Day back with the club next yea See more videos \nHarvey, the Orioles' first-round pick in 2013, has a history of recurring elbow problems. He was shut down prematurely in 2014 because of elbow tightness after throwing just 87 2/3 innings that season. After a strong spring training this season, he suffered a hairline fracture in his right fibula after getting hit by a comebacker. \nHe then experienced elbow tightness again in mid-May. He did not pitch in a minor-league game this season, but was slated to pitch in the Arizona Fall League before feeling discomfort again throwing in instructional league last month. \nUpdate on coaches \nDuquette said the team is working this week to re-sign manager Buck Showalter 's coaching staff. All eight coaches' contracts are up. \n\"We started work on that a couple of months ago,\" Duquette said. \"We met on that again today. We're going to get that resolved as soon as we can. We got a lot of work to do this offseason as far as staffing our team and having a good coaching staff is a good place to start.\" \nShowalter said he'd like to have them all back. \n\"They know that,\" Showalter said. \"Everybody is kind of taking a few days to get home, travel. Dan's talked to them. I've talked to them. They understand where we are. Some of them have decisions to make. … As a group, this is the best coaching staff I've been able to have, but sometimes there are things that come into play, but none of them will be from within.\" \nAround the horn \nDuquette said that a checkup MRI performed on 2B Jonathan Schoop 's right knee was sound. \"The swelling's down,\" Duquette said. \"We got a good report.\" Schoop missed 2 ½ months with a sprained MCL and partially-torn PCL. … RHP Chaz Roe , who didn't pitch at all the final 10 days of the season, had been dealing with flexor mass discomfort in his right arm. … Funeral services for Showalter's mother, Lina, will be held at the Flomaton First Baptist Church in Flomaton, Ala., on Saturday at noon. Lina Showalter died late Saturday night at the age of 87.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:28:23.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
