Regardless, after topping their pool and avoiding a meeting with reigning champions New Zealand, there is optimism in the Ireland camp that they can progress beyond the quarter finals for the first time in their history. \nStanding in their way is Argentina, who despite finishing second in Pool C to the All Blacks, have racked up more points than any other side so far this tournament. The Pumas have been quietly purring until now, but having reached the knockout stage, there's a real chance that the South Americans could spring a surprise. \nIn this video, IBTimes UK sports editor Nick Howson previews the match and gives his predictions on who will emerge victorious. \nIreland vs Argentina kicks off at 1pm BST on Sunday 18 October. Live coverage is available on ITV HD and BBC Radio 5 Live.
