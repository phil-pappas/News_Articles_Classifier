By Charles F. Gardner of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 10, 2015 10:38 p.m. (0) Comments \nGreg Monroe performed well against his former team Saturday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. \nBut that's about the only thing that went right for the Milwaukee Bucks in their 117-88 preseason loss to the Detroit Pistons. \n■ Khris Middleton fouled out in the third quarter after going scoreless in 22 minutes. \n■ Reserve center Miles Plumlee limped off the floor in the fourth quarter after suffering a right knee injury while being fouled on a dunk attempt, although Bucks officials said the injury was not serious. \n■ And Giannis Antetokounmpo hit just 1 of 6 shots and scored five points in 26 minutes. \n■ One more thing: Detroit scored 33 points off 22 Milwaukee turnovers. \nThe Bucks (0-2) put in a sloppy performance from the outset and trailed by 23 points at halftime to the Pistons (1-2) in the annual MACC Fund Game. \nThey never made a serious dent in Detroit's lead in the second half as Marcus Morris paced the Pistons with 21 points and Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson each added 17. \nMonroe signed a three-year, $50 million contract with the Bucks during the summer after playing his first five NBA seasons with Detroit. The 6-foot-11 center had 18 points and eight rebounds in 25 minutes on Saturday and converted 5 of 11 shots. \nMorris scored 17 points in the first half, including a buzzer-beating three-pointer that gave Detroit a 60-37 lead at intermission. \nThe Bucks started the third quarter with greater defensive intensity, and Monroe and Michael Carter-Williams sparked an 8-2 run. \nBut Drummond and Jackson responded and the Pistons pushed the lead back to 82-60 entering the fourth quarter. \nFormer Bucks forward Ersan Ilyasova had five points and four rebounds for Detroit. \nJabari Parker, recovering from knee surgery, sat out again for the Bucks. Milwaukee also was without Chris Copeland due to a family situation. \n\"It will be interesting with them on how they all come together and how Jason (Kidd) plans to use them all once Jabari is back,\" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said before the game. \"To get that combination of length and quickness defensively and keep enough shooting on the floor — it is not an easy balance.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
