Galaxy to 1-1 draw Originally published October 4, 2015 at 9:54 pm By refusing to give up and scoring a goal in stoppage time, the team is saying to opponents, ‘We’re not going to lie down for anyone’ \nIt had been almost one year since the Sounders won their first regular-season MLS title, but their fans made a point not to recognize it until Sunday. \nFor the first time all season, the 2014 Supporters’ Shield banner hung from the CenturyLink Field rafters, a clear “in your face” message to the Los Angeles Galaxy. \nIt was the Galaxy, after all, whom Seattle beat last October in order to lock up that regular-season crown. \nThis time? The Sounders had a new message for their rival: We’re not going anywhere.

You can say that the Galaxy knocked Seattle out of last year’s MLS playoffs and have five championships to the Sounders’ none. \nBut you can not say that Seattle is a doormat, punching bag, or anything other than a concern for their rivals moving forward. Yeah, teams may have to go through L.A. to win a title in the MLS. But the Sounders? It doesn’t appear they’re going to let anyone just roll through them. \n“There isn’t anybody in this league that we can’t beat,” Sounders coach Sigi Schmid said after the 1-1 draw. “Teams don’t usually come back in this league once they go down. We did. We showed that 1-0 is nothing.” \nUp until the third minute of stoppage time, it appeared that the Sounders were wilting into their stereotypical October selves. It would be one thing if the Galaxy had scored via textbook beautiful-game execution, but its first goal was the antithesis to anything aesthetically-pleasing. \nIn the 36th minute, Seattle defender Zach Scott attempted a nonchalant pass toward teammate Gonzalo Pineda, only to have L.A. forward Robbie Keane intercept it, fire a shot from the center of the box, and score as the ball the ball sneaked into the bottom right corner of the goal. And as Scott grabbed his own face while standing hunched over, his body language said it all: We just gave one away. \nIt looked as if that mistake was going to define the night and send the Sounders into a more tenuous playoff position. Coming into the game, Seattle was in fifth place in the Western Conference standings — two points clear of that final postseason spot, but within four points of first place. \nA victory would have made a first-round bye more than attainable with two games left on the schedule. But while that result now seems unlikely, the Sounders probably couldn’t have walked off the field Sunday feeling any more satisfied. \nIn the 93rd minute of the match, Sounders forward Chad Barrett headed a cross from Marco Pappas into the net to tie the score at 1-1. Barrett didn’t even know he would be playing until just moments before the game, but he ended up giving Seattle a lift you have to think will stay with the club moving forward. \nThe Galaxy gave the Sounders nothing all night long. The Sounders had to earn everything they got. And to score the equalizer after 93 minutes of futility? It says something about this team. \nWho knows how this postseason will turn out. Seattle and its fans were equally energized after last year’s October win over the Galaxy, and yet it was L.A. that won the title. \nWhat was made clear Sunday, however, was that Seattle isn’t lying down. \nBefore the game, fans unveiled a banner commemorating what the Sounders have done. At the end of the game, the Sounders gave their fans a sign of what’s to come. Matt Calkins: 206-464-3185 or mcalkins@seattletimes.com .
