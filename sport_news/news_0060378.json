The government also suspended eight policemen for misconduct and initiated a departmental probe against them. The day saw protests by locals who blocked the Faridabad-Mathura highway with the bodies of the children as politicians, including Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, visited the village to express their sympathies with the families. The authorities later persuaded the protesters to lift the blockade and perform the last rites of the children. The Chief Minister, who called off his visit to the village today, promised a government job to children’s father Jitender and free treatment to the injured mother admitted to Safdarjung Hospital. Rahul, who met the children’s father, accused the BJP government of failing to ensure the safety of the weaker sections and said the incident could have been averted had it initiated measures in time. He questioned the administration’s failure to act on a previous complaint by the victims. Officials had allegedly turned away the victims recently, saying they should come only when someone was killed. Asked whether he was doing politics over the incident, Rahul retorted: “It is insulting when someone says this. It is not insulting to me. It is insulting to these people. What is a photo op? What do you mean?” “I will go to any extent to ensure justice to the weaker sections,” he said. He was joined by party leaders, including Shakil Ahmed, HPCC chief Ashok Tanwar and CLP leader Kiran Choudhry. Former Union Minister Kumari Selja also visited the village. Earlier, CPM leader Brinda Karat visited the family and blamed the administration for ignoring the complaints of the victims. “Even after 36 hours, the Chief Minister has not bothered to visit the village, which reflects callousness on part of the government,” she said. Haryana Janhit Congress leader Kuldeep Bishnoi, after meeting the family, said the incident was a blot on the face of the BJP government and sought Khattar’s resignation for failing to run the administration properly. Aam Aadmi Party leaders Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh also visited the family. Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Krishan Pal Gurjar, who visited the village in the evening, said a CBI probe would be conducted into the case. He said six out of the total 11 accused had been arrested so far. A local court today remanded four accused in two-day police custody. The protesters lifted the blockade on the bypass road and at the National Highway No. 2 around 4.15 pm on the intervention of Faridabad Sub-Divisional Magistrate Mahabir Prasad. The protesters were seeking the arrest of the accused. A government spokesman said the eight policemen who had been suspended were: Sadar Ballabgarh Station House Officer Anil Kumar, Assistant Sub-Inspector Wali Mohammad, ESI Shri Bhagwan, EASI Hari Singh, and constables Vikash, Sandeep, Satish and Ram Mehar. Two children were killed and their parents suffered burns when miscreants set fire to the door of their house at Sun Perh village in Ballabhgarh, Faridabad district. A case was registered against 11 persons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:17:46.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
