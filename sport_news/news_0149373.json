After being outmatched in their first three games by opponents who made the playoffs last season, the Bears finally had a victory for their efforts in new coach John Fox’s program -- and they celebrated accordingly.\nHere are three things we learned about the Bears in their 22-20 victory over the Raiders:\n1. Pernell McPhee is emerging as someone teammates want to follow -- because he’s good.\nMcPhee made an impassioned team speech on Saturday night in which he asked his teammates to lock arms to symbolize their togetherness. After the game, it was clear he made a strong impression. Here’s what running back Matt Forte said about it:\n“It's more than just playing football together. It's actually knowing the person, knowing their family, and we're not just teammates. We're out there and (we're) brothers, and you go out there and fight for each other. I'd fight more for my brother than somebody who was just a teammate. It's about getting to know each other and being a family, really a family on the field.”\nOK. Now, here’s a Quote: from left tackle Jermon Bushrod:\n“He wants you to invest yourself in the rest of your teammates, so when game day comes, you want to work harder for that guy beside you because you know a little bit more about him. It’s not just a work-related atmosphere. It’s more of a family-type atmosphere.”\nThat Bushrod Quote: is from December 2013 about ex-coach Marc Trestman. McPhee’s and Trestman’s message overlap almost entirely. So what’s the difference? Why is McPhee’s message resonating?\nBecause he has flashed on the field through four games. Speeches like the one McPhee made Saturday happen every week in every team meeting. Winning and making big plays are what make the words stick.\nPernell McPhee Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune Pernell McPhee (92) grabs an interception in front of Raiders running back Latavius Murray in the second quarter.\nPernell McPhee (92) grabs an interception in front of Raiders running back Latavius Murray in the second quarter.\n(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) McPhee made at least two game-changing plays in Week 4: his interception that Raiders running back Latavius Murray practically handed him, and a third-and-2 tackle that saved the Bears about 50 seconds late in the fourth quarter.\nLeaders in the NFL are a subset of players who are good at football. The Bears need more of both, but they at least appear to have found one in a linebacker to whom they guaranteed $15.5 million. If it continues, that would be a huge win for general manager Ryan Pace and the building effort.\n2. The Bears’ two relatively new offensive tackles showed promise.\nCoaches and players deserve credit for how their offensive line functioned against the Raiders, especially considering 74 of 77 offensive snaps were played by five guys positioned in first-string spots they weren't during the preseason.\nKyle Long has gained confidence four games into his move to right tackle. As expected, his talent is resurfacing as he accumulates experience and becomes more comfortable with the footwork, hand technique and patience required to play in space. Getting the cast off his right hand helped, of course. His athleticism and strength were clear against a talented young rusher in Khalil Mack, whose speed and ability to bend the edge were apparent.\nKyle Long Jose M.

Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Leno appeared much more sound in pass protection on the left side, as advertised. His anchor was spot-on at times against Aldon Smith. Leno said he was more comfortable with the footwork at left tackle because he started 26 games there as a junior and senior at Boise St.\nOf course, it wasn’t a perfect game. Quarterback Jay Cutler’s agility helped, as did a game plan that included quick throws. There there were some missed blocks in the run game, as well. Leno attempted a cut block on the game's third play and landed on center Will Montgomery's leg, breaking Montgomery's left fibula and ending his season. But as whole, the line's physical and mental toughness shined.\n3. The Bears kept oft-injured cornerback Tracy Porter on the roster because he really can cover.\nHis place on the team isn’t a product of Pace’s sentimentality about the Saints’ Super Bowl win. The Bears like his experience and technique. And the eighth-year veteran validated that confidence by standing out for the job he did on Raiders star rookie Amari Cooper.\nQuarterback Derek Carr explained to Chicago media on Wednesday how Cooper’s consistency beating man coverage was a security blanket for him. But Porter’s ability to mirror Cooper’s releases helped him react to breaks and play the ball.\nTracy Porter Jose M.

Osorio / Chicago Tribune) On the downside, Porter’s grab of Cooper’s facemask on third-and-3 in the third quarter gave the Raiders an automatic first down that extended a drive that resulted in a field goal. And Michael Crabtree did use a stutter-step to catch a 25-yarder in front of Porter on the Raiders’ go-ahead field-goal drive in the fourth quarter.\nBut overall, Porter had as much of a positive single-game impact as any Bears cornerback has had throughout the first quarter of the season. Now let’s see if he can stay healthy.\n Chicago Bears Oakland Raiders Pernell McPhee Marc Trestman New Orleans Saints Michael Crabtree Will Montgomery", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5613fda7/turbine/ct-bears-what-we-learned-john-fox-20151006-001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5613fdab/turbine/ct-bears-what-we-learned-john-fox-20151006-002", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5613fdae/turbine/ct-bears-what-we-learned-john-fox-20151006-003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5613fde8/turbine/ct-bears-what-we-learned-john-fox-20151006"], "published": "2015-10-06T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T16:14:33.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
