WARNING: The video contains graphic language and content. The mayor of Pittsburgh has ordered an internal investigation over a video that appears to show a police officer body-slamming a Chicago Cubs fan to the floor at the team's Oct. 7 post-season baseball game against the Pirates at PNC Park. UConn Mac-and-Cheese Student: 'I Am Ashamed' The video, uploaded to YouTube Sunday, appears to show an officer telling a Cubs fan in a goat costume to leave. The Cubs fan asks \"Can I talk to you,\" and the officer puts an arm around him and begins to walk him away. The fan yells \"Stop it,\" and attempts to push the officer's arm away. Someone appears to grab at the device recording the incident, and someone yells \"Put the phone down.\" Then, the video shifts to another angle and an officer is seen picking up the Cubs fan and body-slamming him to the ground.
