Spags is right. It does feel like forever ago the Giants played a game - and we predicted who would win said game - because it has been nine days since the Giants finally got their first victory of the season with a 32-21 Thursday Night Football triumph over the Redskins at MetLife Stadium . That's an eternity in the NFL.\nBut the long wait is over, as the Giants will get back on the field Sunday and try to climb to .500 when they trek to Orchard Park, N.Y., to take on the Buffalo Bills ( and old pal Rex Ryan ) at 1 p.m. at Ralph Wilson Stadium.\nPLUS : NJ.com's complete NFL Week 4 staff picks\nThe Bills are 5.5 point favorites per the guys and gals over at bovada.lv . And here are the NJ.com staff predictions for the game:\nJordan Raanan, Giants reporter (2-1)\nBills 33, Giants 13\nCall it the law of averages game. The Giants have one turnover in three games. They've forced five in those three games. It's not going to last forever. They've been fortunate to recover their own fumbles in each of the past two games. It's not going to happen again in Buffalo. The Bills are the better team and they're playing at home. Better look away Giants fans, Rex is going to be guffawing on the sideline by the end of this one.\nMVP : Bills DT Marcell Dareus\nPut him down for a sack, forced fumble, multiple pressures and run stuffs. The Bills will have Giants quarterback Eli Manning consistently under siege. It's going to be ugly.\nGiants reporter James Kratch (1-2)\nBills 28, Giants 16\nCall it the better team wins, and does so convincingly. Listen, Odell Beckham Jr . didn't say the Bills have one of the league's best defenses to be polite. This is Rex Ryan's best unit as a head coach, and they are going to pin their ears back, feed off their frenzied home crowd and make life very difficult for the Giants' offense. The score will be relatively respectable, but the Bills will win this one going away.\nMVP(s) : Bills CBs Ronald Darby and Stephon Gilmore\nWith Victor Cruz out, Darby and Gilmore will find themselves switching on and off Odell Beckham Jr. and Rueben Randle in coverage. If the duo can keep the Giants' top receiving threats at bay while making a play or two, the Bills will be in very good shape.\nSteve Politi, columnist (1-2)\nBills 24, Giants 20\nCall it Rex's Revenge . The Giants looked better against the Redskins last week, but Rex Ryan will come up with a defensive plan against that shaky offensive line that will bring out Bad Eli Manning . Meanwhile, look for Tyrod Taylor to have a big day against the Giants defense.\nMVP : Bills QB Tyrod Taylor\nHe is fifth in the NFL in completion percentage (74.4%) just ahead of Tom Brady, third in yards per attempt (9.15), third in passing touchdowns (7) and second in touchdown percentage (9%). In other words, after feasting on Kirk Cousins, the Giants face a real emerging threat at QB.", "external_links": ["https://sports.bovada.lv/football/nfl/game-lines-market-group"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:43:30.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
