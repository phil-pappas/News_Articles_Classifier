The rest of the foursomes matches were not much of a contest, and the Americans built a 4-1 lead after the opening session. The South African duo of Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace won the only match for the International side. It was the fifth consecutive time in the Presidents Cup that the United States took the lead, and its largest since a four-point advantage in 2007. The International team hasn’t won since 1998, and this wasn’t the start it wanted. Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson proved a formidable partnership, while Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler won the shortest match. NBA Nuggets take down Bulls in preseason game BOULDER – Joffrey Lauvergne had 18 points and eight rebounds, and the Denver Nuggets beat the Chicago Bulls 112-94 on Thursday night in an exhibition at the University of Colorado’s Coors Event Center. Will Barton had 17 points and Jokic Nikola added 14 for the Nuggets (2-1). NHL Avalanche blow a three-goal lead in opener vs. Wild DENVER – Zach Parise scored three times, including the tiebreaking tally in the third period, and the Minnesota Wild overcame a three-goal deficit to beat the Colorado Avalanche 5-4 on Thursday night. Trailing 4-1 in the final period, the Wild had four goals in a 5 minute, 7 second span to stun the Avalanche. Parise scored twice, while Thomas Vanek and Nino Niederreiter added the other two. Parise beat Semyon Varlamov with a slap shot to put Minnesota up for good midway through the third period. Colorado pulled Varlamov for an extra skater in the final minute but couldn’t score on Devan Dubnyk. Jarome Iginla, Erik Johnson and Gabriel Landeskog had goals in the first period for Colorado. John Mitchell added another in the second as the Avalanche built what appeared to be a comfortable lead before the Wild stormed back. Soccer FIFA suspends Blatter and Platini for 90 days ZURICH – Sepp Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini, the man who had been favored to take over as FIFA leader, were both suspended for 90 days Thursday, plunging soccer’s governing body deeper into crisis. Blatter and Platini were suspended by the FIFA ethics committee in the wake of a Swiss criminal investigation. The decision seemingly ends Platini’s bid to succeed Blatter as FIFA president in the emergency election in February. Another presidential hopeful, Chung Mong-joon, was suspended for six years in a separate case and FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke was banned for 90 days. The suspensions can be extended by up to 45 days. Blatter’s suspension brings a sudden halt to a 40-year career that had survived waves of scandals until he was placed under criminal investigation. Last month, Swiss authorities turned up at Blatter’s office at FIFA headquarters and interrogated him. The criminal case centers on Blatter allegedly misusing FIFA money by making a $2 million payment to Platini, who was questioned as a witness. Platini’s suspension could have the most far-reaching implications. The former France great said he submitted his formal candidacy to stand in the Feb. 26 election to replace Blatter.
