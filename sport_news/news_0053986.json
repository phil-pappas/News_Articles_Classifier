The shooting occurred outside a dormitory near the Northern Arizona University campus. Jake Bacon Arizona Daily Sun via AP i Order Reprint of this Story \nA suspect is in police custody after four people were shot near a residence hall at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff early Friday, according to university officials. \nA statement on the university’s website and on Twitter said one person had died in the shooting, which occurred just after 1 a.m. at the school, which enrolls about 20,000 students at its Flagstaff campus, 140 miles north of Phoenix. The shooting took place near Mountain View Hall. The building houses most of the school’s fraternities and sororities. \nThe three survivors are being treated at Flagstaff Medical Center. University officials said on Twitter that they would be sharing more information about the shooting later Friday. \nMembers of a fraternity, Delta Chi, were involved in the episode but it was unclear whether the person who was killed was affiliated with the fraternity, Justin P. Sherman, the fraternity’s executive director, said in a statement. “At this time, we can confirm that this incident had no ties to the chapter,” he said. \nArizona is an open-carry state whose voters have been strongly opposed to gun control measures in the past, but, Northern Arizona University generally prohibits weapons and firearms, with a few exceptions – guns are allowed in vehicles, for example, if they are stowed. \nPoliticians in Arizona quickly released statements about the shooting but did not approach the topic of gun control. Praying for @NAU and the victims of this morning&#39;s shooting. All Arizonans have the #Flagstaff community in their hearts today. &mdash; Doug Ducey (@dougducey) October 9, 2015 \n“All Arizonans have the Flagstaff community in their hearts today,” Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, wrote on Twitter. Heartbroken by news of fatal shooting on @NAU campus -- families & all of #Flagstaff in my thoughts today. #NAU #AZ01 &mdash; Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (@RepKirkpatrick) October 9, 2015 \nRep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a Democrat who will challenge John McCain for his Senate seat next year, said on Twitter that she was “heartbroken” by news of the shooting. Kirkpatrick softened her opposition to gun control after a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, killed 20 children and six adults. In a statement, McCain praised the emergency workers who responded to the shooting and school officials. \nThe shooting comes eight days after a rampage that left 10 people dead at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, an episode that brought new urgency to a long debate over stricter gun laws. \n“Somehow this has become routine,” President Barack Obama said after that shooting. “The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:48:00.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
