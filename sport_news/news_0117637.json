Gina Raimondo says she's concerned the owners of the Pawtucket Red Sox are talking to officials in Massachusetts about the possibility of moving the minor league baseball team to the Bay State. The Democratic governor said Thursday she wants the Pawtucket-based team to stay in Rhode Island. The team recently ended its pursuit of waterfront land in downtown Providence for a new stadium. Mayor Domenic Sarno told The Republican he could envision a stadium for the Triple-A franchise in Springfield. He said there have been initial talks, which included PawSox co-owner Larry Lucchino. Raimondo says Providence officials are working with the PawSox to find an alternative site in Providence. She says she doesn't know if they're focused on a specific location.
