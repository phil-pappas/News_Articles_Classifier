Department of Health and Environmental Control Board sided with agency regulators. The Bluffton-area executives were told they could not take a medical-expansion permit, known as a Certificate of Need, from the original healthcare commons campus project and apply it to the construction of a free-standing inpatient rehab hospital.\nThe contested application, submitted by Reliant Bluffton Hospital LLC, was for the construction of a $16.7 million, 26-bed rehabilitation facility.\nRegulators had previously awarded a CON to Pace Healthcare Commons for 10 rehabilitation beds, which Reliant had sought to transfer. Fourteen would be transferred from Beaufort Memorial Hospital. But DHEC denied the application in August after Bayview Manor longterm care facility objected to the potential rival.\nApproached after Monday’s board meeting, Reliant representatives Brian Cain and Elizabeth Lamkin declined to be interviewed, although Cain agreed to comment this week. Cain and Lamkin own Pace Healthcare Commons LLC, according to agency records.\nIn sticking up for his decision to deny the Reliant application, Sam Phillips, director of the agency’s Certificate of Need program hearing invoked Pace Healthcare.\n“It wants us to void that CON and give it to this other entity,” he said.\nBut Phillips said CONs for rehabilitation beds don’t work that way.\n“It is an inventory the state calculates and then assigns out, and if you’re not going to use it, you have got to give it back,” he said.\nAs for the Pace Healthcare Commons, Phillips laid out what had been planned.\n“They were to build a post-acute care campus that would have a longterm care facility, a geriatric psych facility, a nursing home and a rehabilitation facility,” he said.\n“That never came about.”\nThe project had struggled to raise capital, and regulators had granted Cain and Lamkin extensions on their various CONs for the campus, which was planned for a 16-acre parcel with south frontage on Bluffton Parkway, half a mile from the west termination at S.C. 170. When completed, Pace Healthcare Commons was projected to create 325 full-time jobs.\nIn February 2011, Bluffton Today reported on Lamkin’s presentation of Pace Healthcare Commons to Bluffton town officials. At that time, it was described as “a for-profit project, four years in the works,” costing about $78 million.\nLike most states, including Georgia, South Carolina requires medical facilities to receive from regulators a certificate of need before any new construction, expansions or expensive equipment purchases. The process is aimed at controlling costs, preventing duplicative medical offerings, and ensuring that poor, rural communities have access to care.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:04:18.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
