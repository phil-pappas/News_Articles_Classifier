(AP) - A study to determine Macon-Bibb County’s ability to support a professional baseball team could come down to a close vote this week. \nThe Macon Telegraph (http://bit.ly/1VyeypO ) reports that four commissioners said last week they plan to vote in favor of the $50,000 feasibility study Tuesday. The study would need support from at least five of the nine commissioners to pass. Two other commissioners have said they’re voting against the measure, while the remaining three haven’t said how they are planning to vote. \nThe resolution, sponsored by Macon Mayor Robert Reichert, would call for a consulting firm to analyze the financial impact of baseball in Macon-Bibb over a 20-year period. \nThree minor league teams have had short stays in Macon since the class-A Macon Braves left after the 2002 season. \n___ \nInformation from: The Macon Telegraph, http://www.macontelegraph.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:21:53.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
