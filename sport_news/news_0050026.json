This is a picture of the aftermath of the crash Wednesday night. (Photo: Bellevue Police Dept.) SWXRightNow.com - \nThe Seattle Seahawks have suspended fullback Derrick Coleman indefinitely pending further information about his arrest Wednesday night. He is under investigation of vehicular assault and felony hit-and-run, but a statement released by his agents Thursday says they believe he fell asleep while driving. \nAt their news conference Thursday afternoon, Bellevue police confirmed that Coleman was arrested after a two-vehicle hit-and-run crash Wednesday night. \nThe early results of their investigation are that a pickup truck was heading east at high speed just before 7 p.m. when it crashed into the back of a car ahead of it. \nThe car was hit with such force that it rolled up a hill and landed on its top. The pickup also rolled over in the street. \nPolice say witnesses pulled the driver of the pickup out of the truck, and then he fled the crash scene on foot without checking on the other driver. Officers say that other driver was seriously hurt, but does not have life-threatening injuries. \nPolice found Coleman nearby and he was arrested without incident for leaving the scene. Officers performed a field sobriety test on Coleman, but there’s no indication that he was drunk or high. So far, the results from that sobriety test are not available. \nColeman was booked into the King County Jail early Thursday morning, and he was held without bail. \nColeman's agents, Derrick Fox and Mark Bloom, released a statement to reporters that reads: \n“On the evening of October 15, 2015, Seattle Seahawk Fullback Derrick Coleman, Jr. was involved in a two-car collision soon after leaving a team meeting. While the facts of the case are still being determined, it seems Derrick may have fallen asleep while driving home from a Seahawks’ facility. The health and well-being of all involved is our primary concern, and we are thankful to report that both parties are expected to make a full recovery. We will continue to work closely with the local officials while a full investigation is being conducted.\" The Seattle Seahawks have suspended Derrick Coleman indefinitely pending further information. — Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) October 15, 2015 \nColeman is in his fourth season with the Seahawks. He spent the 2012 season on the practice squad before making the 53-man roster in 2013. Coleman missed 11 games and the playoffs last season because of a broken foot. The 24-year-old is one of two fullbacks currently on the roster along with Will Tukuafu. He has one yard on two carries so far this season. \nColeman is legally deaf and his football success has made him an inspirational figure. He has been featured in TV commercials and written a book that was released this year. \nHe played for UCLA and then was part of the Minnesota Vikings' practice squad before signing with Seattle in December of 2012. \nInformation from the Associated Press was used in this story.
