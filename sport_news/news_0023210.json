Once it is completed, prosecutors will decide whether to bring charges against the Seahawks fullback, Donohoe said.\nThe Seahawks have suspended Coleman indefinitely pending further information, the team said.\nPolice in Bellevue, a Seattle suburb, said Coleman's fast-moving pickup truck collided with the back of a car on Wednesday evening, shoving the car up an embankment and onto a retention wall, where it came to rest upside down.\nThe car's driver was transported to a local hospital and treated for serious but non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\nAfter his truck came to rest on its side, police said a shoeless Coleman fled the scene on foot and was tracked down a number of blocks away.\nPolice said Coleman cooperated with officers, did not report any injuries and was arrested on felony charges of vehicular assault and hit-and-run.\nColeman is used primarily as a blocker and has one run and one catch this season for Seattle. He has played in 22 games since joining the Seahawks in 2013, with six starts, two this year. Coleman missed 11 games last season with a broken foot.\nHe played on the Seattle team that won the Super Bowl in 2014.\nAccording to his personal website, Coleman is the only hearing-impaired player currently in the National Football League, the only legally deaf player in the history of the NFL, and he spends time supporting deaf youth.\nColeman's first court appearance was canceled for Friday, Donohoe said. It was not immediately known when exactly Coleman would be set free.\nA representative for Coleman could not immediately be reached for comment.\n(Reporting by Eric M.
