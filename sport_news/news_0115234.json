She added that it was special to beat the team that eliminated Miller Place to win the Suffolk Class B title last year. \"I'm in shock right now, I feel like crying. It's such a great win.\"\nEsposito's sister Crystal is the top scorer in Suffolk with 26 points, but Arianna isn't far behind with 17. Arianna believes she has a new offensive upside after learning new dodges this past week.\nField Hockey Miller Place vs. Rocky Point Her first goal broke up a stretch of defensive play by both teams, which lasted the first 15 minutes of the game.\n\"I think we passed really well today,\" Miller Place coach Alana LaMorte said. \"We looked up, we dodged . . . it was pretty hockey. [Defensively] I think they stepped up when they needed to, they marked and they held it down.\"\nRocky Point (9-3) nearly tied the score when Taylor Brodsky passed to Nickie Sciulla on a penalty corner with nine minutes left in the first, but sophomore goalie Ally Tarantino came out to make a diving stop.\nTarantino, who had six saves and faced seven penalty corners, made crucial stops in the final three minutes of the first half, including a kick save to settle play down in front of the cage.\nMiller Place (12-0) increased offensive pressure in the second half, which led to more scoring chances and penalty corners. The Panthers also kept up their shutdown defense and were helped out by Tarantino.\n\"A lot of good stick work on the field today,\" said Miller Place senior Alyssa Parrella, who assisted on Esposito's second goal. They had their stick down a lot, which we had trouble getting past a couple of times, but the biggest thing was communicating to get around the players.\"\nFind scores, schedules and stats Search Or\nSelect a sport in spring Nassau county schools\nBoys Badminton Coed Badminton Girls Badminton Baseball Crew Boys Golf Girls Golf Hand Ball Boys Lacrosse Girls Lacrosse Softball Boys Tennis Boys Track and Field Girls Track and Field Boys Volleyball Suffolk county schools\nBoys Badminton Girls Badminton Baseball Crew Boys Golf Girls Golf Hand Ball Boys Lacrosse Girls Lacrosse Softball Boys Tennis Boys Track and Field Girls Track and Field Boys Volleyball Private schools\nBoys Badminton Coed Badminton Girls Badminton Baseball Crew Boys Golf Girls Golf Hand Ball Boys Lacrosse Girls Lacrosse Softball Boys Tennis Boys Track and Field Girls Track and Field Boys Volleyball Added Parrella: \"Our biggest goal is to keep an undefeated season.\"\nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s high school sports weekly newsletter for the latest stories, scores and photos about Long Island high school sports events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:44:22.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
