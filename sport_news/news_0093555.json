He left the team at the outset of training camp. Luke Walton will continue to serve as interim head coach until Kerr is able to return. \n\"I talked to Steve and he is improving, but there still is no timeline as to when he’s coming back,\" Myers said. \"He’s confident he will be back, but it’s all speculation as to when. \n\"So he told the team that Luke’s going to start the season as the coach, and they’re fully aware that they’re going to have to accept more responsibility. Luke we have full confidence in, he has a great staff around him.\" \nMyers said Kerr would continue to stay engaged with the team and talk to Walton frequently. \n\"Luke will hold down the fort until Luke’s able to come back, and stay back,\" Myers said. \nKerr will be present before Tuesday’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans to take part in the championship ring ceremony. \nBRIEFS: The Dallas Mavericks have waived center Samuel Dalembert and three others as they trim their roster to get ready for the regular season.
