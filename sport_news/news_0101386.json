(AP) — For Purdue seniors Frankie Williams and Danny Anthrop, it’s time to dump the moral victories in exchange for a real one. \nThat opportunity will come Saturday, when the Boilermakers (1-4, 0-1 Big Ten) play Minnesota (3-2, 0-1) in Ross-Ade Stadium, where third-year Purdue coach Darrell Hazell is 0-8 in Big Ten games. \nWhile the Boilermakers have beaten only Indiana State, they were in a position to win during the final two minutes against Marshall, Bowling Green and then this past Saturday at No. 4 Michigan State, which hung on for a 24-21 victory. \nWhile the Golden Gophers had won three straight until this past Saturday’s loss at Northwestern, they have scored only 37 total points in their 12 most recent quarters and rank last in the Big Ten in scoring at 15.4 points a game and last in rushing offense at 141.2 yards a game.
