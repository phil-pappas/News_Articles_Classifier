But it might be the football season in which Newman has learned the most. And it’s also far from its conclusion, if Newman has his way. “I feel better than ever, ready to keep going,” Newman said last Friday night, after a 37-33 victory against visiting Jordan-Matthews. The hope at Graham is that he’ll keep going for a while. Newman committed to WakeForest in the spring, wrapping up a recruiting process that included offers from five AtlanticCoast Conference programs, West Virginia, Vanderbilt and East Carolina, among others. He flew to California as one of 30 participants in the Elite 11 semifinals, billed as a gathering of the top rising high school senior quarterbacks across the country. Given his performance to reach those heights — Newman took over as Graham’s starter as a freshman and was a Times-News All-Region pick in each of the past two seasons — expectations were ramped up entering this season. An ankle injury in a blowout loss to EasternAlamance in the season opener marred the start. Newman missed Graham’s next two games, and the Red Devils lost two of their last three non-conference games upon his return. “It was very frustrating seeing my teammates go out there and need me, and I couldn’t go,” Newman said. “But hey, they stepped up. Even though those two losses really hurt us, they stepped up in many ways.” Now, Newman is healthy and if last week was any indication, he’s ready to steamroll opposing defenders in the same manner as the last few years. He also might be better suited as a leader because of the trying nature of this season. “I’d say it’s been a great leadership lesson,” Newman said. “A great leadership lesson as far as stepping up, keeping my head at all times, staying calm, always staying positive, because that’s what you’ve got to do if you want to keep progressing onto the next level. Always stay dialed in, stay mentally in tact.” Newman notched three rushing touchdowns — two in the third quarter that proved to be the difference — in last week’s victory. Those came after standout Daniel Graves exited with an ankle injury, and could be the boost Graham needs. “A lot of people counted us out from the get-go, from the very first game, but it only adds fuel to the fire to keep going, keep on the roll, keep pressing,” Newman said. “We showed in the second half that when we do what we’re supposed to do on offense, execute all phases of our offense, the ball is moving down the field and that’s what we need.” Page 2 of 2 - While Newman’s future with the Red Devils includes three games and a possible trip to the state playoffs, coach Anthony Timmons wants to make sure it’s known that Newman and this senior class will have a lasting impact for Graham. “Our kids have had a mustard seed planted this year. And we’re going to continue to water that mustard seed and it’s going to come out on a positive end,” Timmons said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:43:27.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
