The Bombers lost at home for just the fourth time in 19 games. \nIthaca sophomore Tristan Brown rushed for two touchdowns and had 67 rushing yards, while classmate Kenny Bradley made nine tackles and recorded his team-leading third interception in the loss for No. 24 Ithaca (4-2, 2-2 Empire 8), which fell at home for the first time since Oct. 11, 2014. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nSenior Josh Oliver totaled 113 all-purpose yards, including an electrifying 45-yard kickoff return, but the Bombers were outgained 368-198 by the Golden Eagles (3-2, 2-2). \nSenior Malik Morris recorded eight tackles, broke up two passes and blocked an extra point, while senior Logan Murphy and sophomore Dan Loizos each added eight tackles against Brockport. \nSenior Schnayder Termidor added seven tackles and junior Skyler Kauf made six tackles for the Bombers. \nIthaca, which entered play with the fourth-stingiest rushing defense in the nation (55 rushing yards per game) held Brockport's Dan Andrews to 117 rushing yards on 30 carries, far below his season-average of 173 yards per game. \nAndrews, who entered as Division III's leader in rushing touchdowns with 14, was held without a touchdown for the first time this year. \nThe Bombers took a 14-7 lead into halftime thanks to a pair of short touchdown runs by Brown. \nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Ithaca capitalized on good field position following a shaky Brockport punt. The Bombers took over at the Brockport 22-yard line and needed just two plays to score a touchdown. \nJunior Wolfgang Shafer found sophomore Brad Helmkamp for a 19-yard gain, and Brown punched it in from three-yards out for a 7-0 lead \nOn the ensuing possession, Bradley came away with an interception of Wayne Bonsell, giving the Bombers possession at the Brockport 30. \nFacing third-and-15, Shafer hit sophomore Jared Bauer for 14 yards, bringing up fourth-and-one. Brown bulled his way for three yards to convert, and Brown accounted for the final 21 yards on the drive, including a two-yard sprint off the left tackle to put the Bombers up 14-0 with 8:10 remaining in the second quarter. \nBrockport scored its first touchdown with eight seconds left in the half and knotted the score on a 71-yard touchdown pass from Bonsell to Nate Wilkinson with 10:47 remaining in the third. \nOliver then returned the ensuing kickoff 45 yards to the Brockport 47. On fourth and six from the Brockport 43, Ithaca lined up to punt the ball away before senior Noah Poskanzer took the direct snap and rushed 19 yards for the first down. \nSenior Max Rottenecker would make a 23-yard field goal for a 17-14 Ithaca lead with 5:40 remaining in the third, but the Golden Eagles would close out the game scoring the final 13 points to snap Ithaca's five-game win streak vs. Brockport. \nBrockport scored on 14- and 10-yard touchdown passes to secure the win. After the final Brockport touchdown, Morris rushed in from the edge and blocked Tyler Perna's extra point, the first blocked extra point since Sept. 29, 2012 against Utica College. \nIthaca travels to Empire 8 foe Morrisville State for a 1 p.m. contest Oct. 24, while Brockport travels to Cortland for a 1 p.m. kickoff. \n(Courtesy: Ithaca College)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:39:25.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
