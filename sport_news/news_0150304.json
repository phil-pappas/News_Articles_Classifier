(WKYT) - Louisville coach Rick Pitino discussed the scandal surrounding his basketball program on WHAS late Thursday afternoon. \nPitino was interviewed over the phone by WHAS personality Terry Meiners, a long time friend. Meiners brought up the word \"resignation\" at the beginning. \n\"So I don't know what resigning would accomplish,\" answered Pitino. \"I think that's the cowardly way out. If I resign now without coaching two fifth year seniors and the people who came to play for me. What does it do for the program if the head coach just runs away? I don't understand why you asked me that.\" \nFormer Louisville basketball player and staffer Andre McGee is at the center of the scandal. He allegedly paid for escorts for Louisville recruits and players. Pitino told Meiners he's talked with McGee one time. \n\"I had one conversation with him Terry and, to be honest with you, I don't know if he told me the truth or not. As things come out, it may not have been the truth of what he told me. They asked me not to speak to him again. I gave him a strong piece of my mind. He told me something and I can't really say, but it's not what came out in that book. But the facts have to come out right now.\" \nAllegations against the Louisville program surfaced Friday in the book \"Breaking Cardinal Rules.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:17:59.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
