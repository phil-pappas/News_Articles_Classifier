The Yankees have also been linked to righty Jeff Samardzija . \nFrom the report: \nIn addition to the incumbent Dodgers, several more big-market and others teams are expected to be in the hunt for top starting pitching, including the rival Giants plus the Red Sox, Cubs, Yankees, Tigers, Diamondbacks, Phillies, Marlins, Blue Jays, Cardinals, Braves, Rangers (and more). \nPLUS: Uh oh, Mets: Chicago Cubs 'similar to' Boston Red Sox that stunned Yankees \nThe Yankees have shown restraint in the high-price free-agent market since committing more than $400 million to starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, outfielders Carols Beltran and Jacoby Ellsbury and catcher Brian McCann before the 2014 season. \nBut they — like any team — could use an ace-type starting pitcher, for a number of reasons. Tanaka hasn't shown that he's No. 1 quality, and health issues still haunt him, CC Sabathia, Michael Pineda and Nathan Eovaldi. \nBrendan Kuty may be reached at bkuty@njadvancemedia.com .
