But this year could be different, Jones said.“I think we are better than they are this year,” Jones explained. “That doesn’t mean we are going to win, but I think we are better than they are.”Lamar quarterback Hunter Davenport has generated over 1,000 yards of offense for the Warriors in six games. Davenport is 21-of-49 for 636 yards passing for 13 touchdowns and has 569 yards rushing on 57 carries for nine touchdowns.Will he be key to the Lamar offensive attack? Obviously.The Warriors have five running backs and three receivers with 100 yards to their name.Charleston, which lost two-straight games to open its season, has barely over 1,000 yards passing spread between three quarterbacks. The Tigers have 869 yards and 19 rushing touchdowns.By offensive numbers, Jones’ statement of superiority rings true — barely — but numbers aren’t the only things that matter to a football team.“They’re really talented,” Jones said. “They have a lot of tradition. They’re just really, really good. They have a lot of speed and a little bit of size. They know how to win, and they’ve been doing it for a really long time.“For the last two years we have played really well against Charleston, but they were just better than us. Sometimes, you play well, and you get beat. They went undefeated for two years and won two state championships. My hat is off to them, they were really good. They’re still really good.”Jones said the Tigers spread offense likes to cut away yardage through the air, which will be a test for his secondary.“We haven’t been tested that way all year,” he said. “They are going to throw the ball 35 times probably, so our secondary will have to step up. We just have to take away some of their short passing and the screen passes. They run a gimmicky, tricksy offense sometimes, so we will have to recognize those trick plays and stop them.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:37:39.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
