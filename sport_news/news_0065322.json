(Neil Hall/Reuters) \nA professional hockey team in the United Kingdom’s Elite Ice Hockey League wasn’t particularly thrilled to learn the reason why its Friday matchup against a team in Belfast, Ireland, was postponed this week. The Sheffield Steelers were scheduled to play the Stena Line Belfast Giants, but instead, English-Irish boy band One Direction will be singing at SSE Arena in Belfast. \nThe band was scheduled to perform at the arena Tuesday, but band member Liam Payne became ill , which forced the show to be moved to Friday, bumping the hockey game. A makeup date for the game has not yet been announced, the Giants said in a statement.
