After Morris carried a team-high 17 times against the Eagles the following week, he had only eight attempts in Sunday’s 25-19 overtime loss to the Falcons. \n“We were stuck in a lot of second and eights, a lot of second and nines,” Gruden said . “And when that’s the case, we’re not going to be too good with the running game and Alfred is not going to get that many touches. Hopefully in the future next week and the week after that we’ll get him more involved.” \n[ Mailbag: On the disappearance of Darrel Young and Jeron Johnson ] \nIndeed, the Redskins averaged two yards on 19 first-down carries against the Falcons. Despite the fact that Morris is averaging a career-worst 3.7 yards per carry, former Redskins running back Clinton Portis said the Redskins should give him the carries necessary to find his rhythm. \n“I know it’s beautiful to have three great cars in your garage, but you can only drive one,” Portis said of the Redskins’ running backs Tuesday on ESPN 980’s The Drive with Cooley and Czabe. “So you bring the other ones out on special occasions. I think Alfred Morris should be the lead dog until he does something wrong. Right now at this point, Alfred Morris has [done] no wrong in my eyes and should be the guy who gets the majority of the carries because he brings a different mentality to this team. I think he makes guys tougher, guys really rally around him and the same way guys are beginning to rally around Kirk Cousins, guys respond to Alfred Morris. Matt Jones is a young back and Chris Thompson is a young back. They’re great, electric guys, but they don’t make guys respond to them.” \n[ What’s happened to the Redskins’ running game? ] \nCooley asked Portis how a running back can be effective while going long stretches without a carry, as Morris did Sunday. \n“You can’t,” Portis said. “Not only can you not sit down for an hour, going the first series and then out the next two, then going another series, man, I would drift away. I would probably be one of those little kids on the Pee Wee teams that’s looking for frogs or trying to climb the fence. I would probably be off in the stands, having someone bring me a hot dog. You really can’t get into the game.” \nPortis went on to say that the Redskins should use fullback Darrel Young more in the running game, especially in front of Morris. \n“I think you’ve got to roll with Alfred because he’s going to wear down the defense regardless,” Portis said. “Whether it’s two yards, three yards, the defense will get tired of stopping Alfred Morris. Then you bring Matt Jones in, or you bring Chris Thompson in.” Scott Allen writes about all things D.C. sports.
