The Pirates are expected to have sophomore wide receiver Chase Takaki back from a shoulder injury. The team should also have the services of junior offensive lineman Michael Cruciotti, who missed last week’s 32-7 win over Pacific Lutheran. \nHowever, the team was awaiting results on X-rays on the wrist of senior defensive end Aaron Powe, who leads the team with four sacks and is second on the team with six tackles for loss. He was injured during the win over PLU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:45:24.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
