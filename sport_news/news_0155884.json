White began his sentence after exhausting all of his options in state courts to overturn his convictions.\nWhite was convicted in February 2012 of six Class D felony charges, including voter fraud, perjury and theft. The charges stemmed from his residency while he served on the Fishers Town Council. Prosecutors said he voted and took pay as a council member of a district in which he no longer resided. White claimed he was living with his ex-wife, which was within the council district. But evidence presented during his trial in Hamilton Superior Court indicated that he had been living with his then-fiancee in a new townhome outside the district.\nA jury convicted him of three counts of voter fraud, two counts of perjury and one count of theft. Hamilton Superior Court Judge Daniel Pfleging sentenced White to one year of home detention.\nWhite spent the year after his conviction arguing in court that he shouldn't have to serve his sentence, citing his defense attorney's alleged incompetence. Pfleging in January 2014 decided that White would not have to serve his sentence while he tried to persuade the Indiana Court of Appeals to overturn his convictions.\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\nAppeals Court throws out 3 convictions in Charlie White case\nLast December, the appeals court threw out two of his three voter fraud convictions and one of two perjury convictions, citing double jeopardy, while letting the remaining three stand. The Indiana Supreme Court in July denied White's request to hear his case.\nIn an order signed last month, Pfleging resentenced White to one year of home detention. Each of the remaining three convictions carried home detention sentences that must be served at the same time.\nThe judge also ordered White to pay a $1,000 fine and to do 30 hours of community service.\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\nCharlie White intends to ask U.S. Supreme Court to hear appeal\nStar reporter Chris Sikich contributed to this story.\nCall Star reporter Kristine Guerra at (317) 444-6209.
