And knows he can find them here.\nStewart says, \"We are needing diesel service technicians, diesel farm equipment parts people, and also sales people and the technology program at Pitt state is top of the line. And this is the best place to come to get candidates to work for us throughout the state of Kansas.\"\n PSU’s director of Career Services, Mindy Cloninger says, \"It’s a wonderful opportunity for students because they don't have to travel, don't have to find the companies, hospitals, and school districts. And find out who’s hiring. They can come here and find out who's hiring and positions available to them.\"\n\"It’s been amazing! I've learned so many things.\"\nKimberly Hagerman is looking to find work as she continues school for her masters. She says the fair is better than her current online and word of mouth strategy.\n\"You feel free to ask questions. They tell you what they're actually looking for.\"\nCareer days are not only about convenience, students say it takes the stress out of job hunting.\nHagerman says, \"It feels really good because it’s not you alone trying to find some place.They're actually looking for good people to work for them too . \"\n Jacob Yanovich is at PSU to get his Masters in Business Administration and says he expects to find a job at the career expo. \"Instead of just having to approach companies, a lot of them will grab you by the arm and start these conversations up and make it easy and approachable to talk to some of these companies. That intimidation factor goes away by the second you walk into the door.”\nCoordinators even encourage freshman to come to start networking.\nCloninger says, \"The same representatives will come time and time again and so the students can really establish a great relationship over the next couple of years. Then when they're ready to apply for internships, clinicals that sort of thing, they have that relationship. Then by their senior year they're ready to go.\"\nSeveral companies reserve rooms and will conduct interviews this evening and tomorrow.\n Actual job offers are sometimes made during the career expo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:57:17.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
