It would be a third straight playoff appearance for the Warriors, who started the year with four straight loss. \nThe Warriors (3-5, 3-4 Valley Football Association-North Division) would become eligible by finishing with a .500 record in the conference. Even with a losing record overall, West would have a strong chance of making the Division 1 playoff field. The spot is not automatically guaranteed, however. \nWest is among the interesting storylines going into the final week of the regular season. \nTomahawk (5-3, 3-3 Marawood) can clinch its first postseason berth since 2007 with a home win over Chequamegon. \nAthens (7-1, 6-0 Marawood) has an opportunity to grab a share of the Cloverwood Conference title with a win at undefeated Abbotsford. Marathon (7-1) would win its first outright Marawood title since 1982 with a win over Auburndale. A loss would give Edgar a chance to grab a share of the title. \nThe Week 9 schedule is: Greenwood/Granton at Newman Catholic (Thursday), Wausau West at Appleton West, Appleton North at D.C. Everest, Kimberly at Wausau East, Auburndale at Marathon, Chequamegon at Tomahawk, Rib Lake/Prentice at Edgar, Athens at Abbotsford, Lakeland at Mosinee and Wittenberg-Birnamwood at Amherst. \nHere are five notable matchups to watch. All games begin at 7 p.m. \nWAUSAU WEST (3-5, 3-4 VFA-NORTH) \nAT APPLETON WEST (4-4, 4-3 VFA-NORTH) \nLast meeting: Wausau West 41, Appleton West 6 (2014) \nAbout Wausau West: The Warriors have allowed a total of 14 points in their three wins — against Kaukauna, Wausau East and Appleton East — and are coming off their first shutout since Week 3 of last season. The Warriors have forced five turnovers over the past two weeks. \nAbout Appleton West: The Terrors' four wins have surpassed the program’s combined wins over the past three seasons. West scored 29 points in the fourth quarter last Friday to down Kaukauna 49-35 and become playoff eligible for the first time since 2004. Patrick Ourada rushed for 207 yards in the win. \nAPPLETON NORTH (6-2, 5-2 VFA-NORTH) \nAT D.C. EVEREST (5-3, 5-2 VFA-NORTH) \nLast meeting: Appleton North 21, D.C. Everest 21 (2014) \nAbout Appleton North: The Lightning are averaging 37 points per game and are a game ahead of the Evergreens for second place in the VFA-North. Bob Babich has totaled a team-high 1,127 yards rushing for the Lightning and is averaging 8.1 yards a carry. Alex Thiel has been a defensive leader for Appleton North in conference play. \nAbout D.C. Everest: The Evergreens had a five-game winning streak snapped with a loss at Kimberly last week, but a win would give them their highest victory total in a season season since 2011 when Everest finished with a 7-5 record. Stephen Paoli has run for more than 200 yards the past two weeks and leads the VFA-North in rushing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:03:02.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
