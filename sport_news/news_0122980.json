A big egg.\"\nRyan Fitzpatrick threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score, and Chris Ivory rushed for 146 yards and a TD on 20 carries for the Jets. Marshall had seven catches for 111 yards and a touchdown, and Eric Decker also caught a TD pass.\n\"Every win's not going to be pretty,\" Bowles said. \"We're going to make some mistakes, but how we come back from it and how we grow as a team moving forward is what's going to make us a decent team.\"\nA few things to know from the Jets' comeback victory over the Redskins:\nTHIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS: Two plays after Nick Folk tied it at 13 with a 39-yard field goal, the Jets got the ball back when Darrelle Revis intercepted Cousins' pass for Ryan Grant. With the ball at the Redskins 18, the Jets wasted no time as Fitzpatrick took off up the middle, got a big block from tight end Kellen Davis near the goal line and got into the end zone for a 20-13 lead.\nMarshall made it 26-13 with a terrific fingertips catch just off his shoe tops, getting inside of Breeland on a low throw. He then scooted down the sideline for a 35-yard TD.\nNew York got the ball back when Marcus Gilchrist picked off Kirk Cousins' deep pass for Jamison Crowder. Decker caught a 2-yard pass to put the Jets comfortably in front, 34-13 early in the fourth quarter.\nNew York has outscored opponents 34-0 in the third quarter this season. Meanwhile, Washington has been outscored 46-3.\nCAPTAIN KIRK: Cousins was 25 of 43 for 196 yards with a touchdown to Pierre Garcon, but also threw two interceptions. He has two INTs each in four games this season — all losses, but no INTs in Washington's two wins.\nGruden dispelled any murmurs of a quarterback controversy, saying the Redskins are sticking with Cousins.\n\"You hate to pin this game on Kirk,\" Gruden said. \"I know he could have played better. We had no running game whatsoever. Kirk is not in a stage in his career right now, nor is anybody on our roster, to carry our team throwing the ball as much as we would have had to today.\"\nRICHARDSON'S RETURN: Jets defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson was credited with a half-sack and three assisted tackles in his first game after sitting out the first four because of a suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy.\n\"I did all right,\" he said. \"Sideline-to-sideline plays weren't as consistent as I usually have been. But other than that, it was good.\"\nBREELAND'S BIG DAY: With Hall out with injured toe, Breeland got the start in his place and was all over the field in the first half.\nHe recovered Decker's fumble on New York's opening drive, setting up Garcon's 2-yard TD catch. After the Jets tied it on Ivory's 1-yard run, Washington forced another turnover when Breeland ripped the ball out of Marshall's hands after a 12-yard catch. Dustin Hopkins kicked a 54-yard field goal to tie it at 10.\nThe Jets turned it over again on their next possession as Fitzpatrick's pass tipped off Marshall's hands and Breeland made a diving interception. Six plays later, Hopkins kicked a go-ahead 30-yarder.\nLOOK WHO IT IS: With all the Redskins' injuries to starters, they had no choice but to make Robert Griffin III active against the Jets.\nHe was in uniform on the sideline for the first time this season — but as the third-stringer behind Cousins and backup Colt McCoy.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:39:48.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
