Eric Hall, the district water master, has walked the Tuolumne Main Canal and used GPS to map locations of the hazard trees in relation to the system of ditches and flumes that convey most of the district’s water to 44,000 people in Tuolumne County. Some dead trees have required crane removal because of their location, and there are more that may require the same, Don Perkins, TUD’s operations manager, said Tuesday at a district board of directors meeting. Removal in some locations could cost as much as $125 per tree. Specific ditches affected by drought-stressed and bark beetle-infested trees include the Section 4 Ditch, where there are 24 dead trees, 15 more that TUD staff are watching, and eight trees have been removed so far, according to Hall. There are 88 dead trees along the Upper Soulsbyville Ditch and 14 more being watched, and there are 104 dead trees along the Lower Soulsbyville Ditch. There are 44 dead trees along the Upper Columbia Ditch and 152 dead trees along Eureka Ditch. Other TUD facilities that are impacted by dead and dying trees include the Twain Harte wastewater treatment plant, where there are 125 dead trees and 99 trees have already been removed at a cost of $6,740. There are also dead trees at Rainbow Reservoir, Cedar Ridge water treatment plant, Tuolumne water treatment plant, and at Phoenix Lake. The district is partnering with Tuolumne County, which has declared a local state of emergency because of tree mortality, to seek funding for tree removal, Perkins said. Staff will continue to monitor and prioritize trees that could damage TUD facilities. In other district business Tuesday, the board voted 5-0 to reject a resident’s claim for $6,700 in damages stemming from a pipe break at a hydrant Aug. 13 on North Shepherd Street in Sonora. According to TUD staff, Bettizane Smith says her property sustained damage and outside terraces were compromised. The board also voted 5-0 to approve a $1.3 million agreement with NorCal Pipeline Services, Inc. for the Gibbs Ranch sewer collection improvements project west of Dragoon Gulch, according to TUD staff. The project, funded by a state Department of Housing and Community Development grant, involves about 15,560 linear feet of sewer main, 4 inches to 8 inches diameter, to be rehabbed with cured-in-place pipe, and replacement of about 485 linear feet of existing pipe. The project includes installing about 20 new manholes, and modification and repair of about 40 existing manholes. The district’s first forum to share information about planned water and sewer improvements, costs and potential rate increases was held Tuesday night in Columbia. Three more are scheduled, Thursday in Soulsbyville, Oct. 20 in Tuolumne, and Oct. 26 in Sonora. A public hearing is scheduled at 5:30 p.m. Nov. 17, when the district board of directors will consider public comments as well as any written protests submitted against proposed water and sewer rate increases. District staff have summarized a proposed treated water rate increase in monthly fixed service charges from $36.38 to $47.50, effective Jan. 1. If that fixed charge increase is approved, a typical TUD family bill will be about $60 a month, assuming 225 gallons daily usage. According to TUD staff, that works out to an increase of about $14.60 a month, or 49 cents a day.
