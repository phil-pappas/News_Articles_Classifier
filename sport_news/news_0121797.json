Mom was speaking in the abstract about \"pulling the plug,\" and I burst into tears and ran out of the kitchen.\nThree years ago, when Mom turned 85 and was unwell, I knew she was leaning toward cremation, but did she have a final resting place in mind? I decided I should ask.\nMom started talking about her three husbands (two long dead; one living with her in Florida) as well as churches and cemeteries in Texas, Massachusetts, New York and elsewhere. And I still didn't know what she wanted. Maybe Mom didn't either. Who wants to die in the first place?\nThis March, I was in Montana for my daughter's wedding when I learned that my mother was going into hospice. Mom was able to attend the wedding virtually by Skype, and afterward my husband, Rob, and I high-tailed it south.\nWe got there just in time. Mom smiled and brightened as we talked, but she could no longer reply with full sentences. I stroked her forehead and told her I loved her and that she'd had a beautiful life. I told her I was proud of her — she'd been the garden editor of House & Garden. I told her we would take care of her house and garden. I told her not to worry about anything. I held her hand. And I told her she could let go — but that we'd still hold her close, just as we'd held onto Dad, who had died when I was 25.\nAs I stayed with my mother, curling my fingers around hers, watching her gently die, I did not add that Dad would be waiting for her. I did not really believe that, and besides, what about her second husband, Lewis? Mom and he had shared five summers in Cape Cod before he died at age 70. And what about her current spouse, Leighton, whom she married in 1991?\nMom stopped breathing while I was at dinner with my brother Mark. Our other sibling, Eric, felt guilty that he hadn't noticed the instant of death. But there had been no rattle; Eric had looked up and Mom was gone. The hospice workers said this often happens. It's hard to \"leave a party\" — harder still if loved ones are sobbing or holding on tight. Sometimes the sick person has to slip away when no one is looking.\nSoon we began talking about what to do with Mom's ashes. I blurted, \"Dad gets half.\" I felt strongly that our father should get more than the other husbands, especially because he was buried in Texas next to our grandparents and great-grandparents and a marker that already said, \"Marybeth Little Weston 1927 - .\"\nBut what about the other half? My brother Mark, who had scored 800 on his Math SAT, suggested that the second husband could get 10 percent, the current husband could get 25 percent, and we could put 15 percent in Mom's garden in Armonk, N.Y., where her children and grandkids were most likely to visit. Eric and I said OK, and Mark, as executor, alerted the crematorium. Four canisters, please: 50 percent, 25 percent, 15 percent, 10 percent.\nLove can't be divvied up, but ashes sometimes need to be. We felt good about our decision and turned our attention toward hosting a memorial service in Florida.\nWe also began to plan a more elaborate memorial in Armonk that would take place 100 days later. We would serve oysters and crab cakes (Mom's favorites). And the next day, we would drive to the cemetery in nearby Valhalla and bury one quarter of Mom's cremains next to the mausoleum of her husband Leighton's forbears.\nIn late June, however, Leighton said he couldn't make the trip north, even with a caregiver. This meant he wouldn't be accompanying us to the cemetery. Suddenly it didn't feel right to leave a quarter of Mom alone with his ancestors.\n\"What if we switched two of the canisters?\" I asked. \"What if we put 15 percent by the mausoleum and 25 percent by the gazebo?\" Mark and Eric agreed that it would be nice to have more of Mom in the backyard where we'd grown up.\nHours before her summer service, we dug a little hole in her garden and, under a fine drizzle, her kids and grandkids spilled in 25 percent of her ashes and took turns saying heartfelt farewells.\nLater, at the cemetery, we spilled 15 percent into a pre-dug hole next to the mausoleum inscribed with Leighton's last name.\nTwo canisters were left. One with 10 percent to scatter in Cape Cod. One with 50 percent to take to Texas.\nIn July, I started wishing there were more of Mom to go around. \"What if we took some ashes from the Texas canister and put them up here instead?\" I said. Twenty-five percent no longer seemed like enough. After all, I'd begun to talk to Mom every time I picked flowers.\nSoon we were prying open the biggest canister, snipping the plastic bag, and pouring out a quarter of the Texas ashes so that, as Mark explained, there would be three-eighths of Mom with Dad, and three-eighths with us. It felt like one of those dreaded math word problems — with a macabre twist. Yet I'd been the one to propose the recalculation.\nIn August, Rob and I drove to Massachusetts to the breakwater in Cape Cod Bay where Mom's second husband's ashes had been released long ago. We emptied the 10-percent bag and watched her ashes swirl out to sea. \"Mom, you were happy here,\" I said.\nThe final errand is still ahead, and Mark, Eric, and I will all go to Texas this spring with the remaining three-eighths, the same amount now buried beneath Mom's autumn flowers.\nMom didn't leave us with clear instructions. She may have figured that we'd figure it out. And perhaps we did.\nBut it's not possible to measure out a mother's life and love, is it?\nCarol Weston is an advice columnist and the author of many books, including \"Ava and Taco Cat\" and \"Girltalk.\"\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Opinion Commentary", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56243eec/turbine/ct-cremation-ashes-mom-family-perspec-1019-20151018"], "published": "2015-10-19T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:25:56.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
