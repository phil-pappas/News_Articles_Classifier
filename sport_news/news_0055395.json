Ira Winderman Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Being whole, healthy is goal for a Heat a week before season opener \nThe goal of the preseason was to get a leg up on the completion. The reality for the Miami Heat is that Goran Dragic still is searching for his, while Hassan Whiteside has been hobbled since the start of the process. \nTuesday, even with all five starters on the practice court at AmericanAirlines Arena for just the third time, questions remained just one week before it starts for real. \nWhile Whiteside returned from the sprained left ankle that kept him out of Sunday's exhibition victory over the Atlanta Hawks at Philips Arena, Dragic again stayed for post-practice conditioning, still paying for an offseason away from the game. \n\"For me, it's the first time in this kind of position,\" Dragic said almost apologetically after practice and time on the stationary bike. \"Because in the past eight, nine years I was always preparing with my national team. So I played all summer and when it came to the training camp, I was already in game-time shape.\" \nInstead, after spending time at home on his native Slovenia as an expectant father, these past three weeks have been an uphill climb, as the Oct. 28 season opener against the visiting Charlotte Hornets draws closer. Spoelstra says ball movement remains the goal \nErik Spoelstra acknolwedges work remains for Heat during preseason, including ball movement. \nErik Spoelstra acknolwedges work remains for Heat during preseason, including ball movement.

I play the first two quarters, I feel OK. But then I hit the wall in that third or fourth quarter.\" \nCoach Erik Spoelstra said Dragic had his strongest outing of the preseason in Saturday's victory over the Houston Rockets at the Toyota Center. \n\"I thought he had great legs in the Houston game,\" he said. \"He looked like he had another gear. His conditioning was great. So I look at it as: Is he getting better each day? Is he getting better each week? He's much better in week three than he was on week two, and that's easy to see.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:02:10.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
