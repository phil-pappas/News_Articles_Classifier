Seattle survives thanks to late play 1 / 1 \nSeattle \nWith one big punch, Kam Chancellor showed his importance to the Seattle Seahawks . \nAnd once again, the Seahawks may have received another Monday night break from the officials in the same end zone where the infamous \"Fail Mary\" took place against the Green Bay Packers in 2012. \nChancellor knocked the ball free from Detroit wide receiver Calvin Johnson at the 1-yard line when it appeared the Lions were going to take the lead, and Seattle held on for a 13-10 win. \nWith Detroit on the verge of capping a 91-yard drive with the go-ahead touchdown with less than 2 minutes remaining, Chancellor came from the side and punched the ball from Johnson's arm as he was being tackled by Earl Thomas . The ball bounded into the end zone where it was guided over the back line by K.J. Wright for a touchback and Seattle's ball at the 20. \nWright could have been called for illegal touching for hitting the ball out of the end zone, which would have given the ball back to Detroit. But no flags were thrown and on the ensuing possession, Russell Wilson found Jermaine Kearse for 50 yards on third down. With Detroit out of timeouts, the Seahawks (2-2) ran off the final seconds of their second straight win. \n\"We can't change it now,\" Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \"It is what it is. We won and we're going to move on.\" \nDetroit fell to 0-4 for its worst start since 2010 when it also started 0-4 on the way to a 6-10 season. \n\"It was big time,\" Wagner said of Chancellor's return. \"He just made us a whole defense.\" \nWilson was forced to be an escape artist as Seattle's offensive line continued to struggle with protection. He threw for 287 yards and rushed for another 40 yards. Wilson's most memorable play was spinning free of two near sacks and finding Kearse for 34 yards in the second quarter, and then hitting Doug Baldwin on a 24-yard TD on the next play. \nSeattle was without Marshawn Lynch after he had back problems flare up during pregame warmups. \nMatthew Stafford was 24-for-35 for 203 yards for Detroit, which lost starting tight end Eric Ebron and both starting defensive tackles Haloti Ngata and Tyrunn Walker to injuries.
