Sports Adrian Wojnarowski . \nIn the video posted above, you can see Booker take an open handed swing at Hibbert. \nThe incident occured after Booker got tangled up with Julius Randle. Booker pushed Randle away, leading Roy Hibbert to come across the court to confront Booker. After Hibbert made contact with his chest, Booker slapped Hibbert with his left hand. \nBooker was ejected upon review, with Hibbert earning a technical foul for his role in the skirmish. Randle was assessed a personal foul for the initial contact. \nThe suspension means Booker will miss the Jazz's opening regular season game against Detroit on Oct. 28, unless Booker were to appeal. Personally, I'd be shocked if he did choose to appeal. One game is a reasonable and fair suspension for this type of incident. \nThat would likely mean more minutes for Jazz rookie Trey Lyles, backing up Derrick Favors for that game.
