Here’s a rundown on Monday’s developments: • The Ashley Ridge at Goose Creek game has been canceled and will not be made up. Goose Creek begins Region 7-AAAA play Friday at James Island; Ashley Ridge is home to Colleton County. • Bishop England will play its Region 6-AA opener against visiting Whale Branch at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, then will play at Battery Creek at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 12 (Monday). The Bishops will return home Oct. 16 against Garrett. • Colleton County’s game at South Aiken has been canceled. • With Berkeley, Charleston and Dorchester counties canceling school again for Tuesday, games involving schools from those districts will have to be put off until at least Wednesday. The S.C. High School League on Monday issued guidance on rescheduling to member schools, suggesting a minimum of two days off between games. The High School League said two days off is not “ideal,” but that it would support that gap between games. The High School League also said games postponed last Friday can be made up as late as Wednesday, and suggested moving this week’s games from Friday to Saturday or Monday. Then, games scheduled for Oct. 16 can go on as planned. “None of these suggestions is ideal,” the High School League memo said. “Player safety is to be considered first and foremost when rescheduling games.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:07:43.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
