San Jacinto Valley Academy8. Avalon A A A \nAs has been the case this entire season, Hart remains the only football team in town to appear on the top 10 CIF-Southern Section rankings. \nOn the heels of an impressive 52-28 win over rival Canyon on Friday, Hart stood pat at seventh in the latest West Valley Division poll, which was released on Monday. That marks two straight weeks at the No. 7 spot for the 5-1 Indians. \nElsewhere in the football polls, Santa Clarita Christian appears to be on the cusp of cracking the top 10 in the East Valley Division with its appearance in the “others” section. \nAfter beating crosstown Trinity 42-18 on Saturday, SCCS improved to 5-1 to build off its best start to a season since 2010, when it began 6-0 and ended up finishing with a 10-2 record. \nThat was SCCS’s final season as an 8-man team. It has never reached a top 10 ranking as an 11-man squad. \nThis year, the high-scoring Cardinals are proving they can make some noise at the 11-man level as well. \nOutside of football, three Santa Clarita Valley teams maintained their No. 1 divisional rankings, while one dropped off. \nThis week’s local No. 1 teams are the Saugus girls cross country team (CIF-SS Division 2), Valencia girls tennis (CIF-SS Division 2) and SCCS girls volleyball (CIF-SS Division 5AA). \nThe West Ranch boys cross country team, however, dropped two spots down to No. 3 in Division 2 boys after occupying the top spot for the last four weeks. \nThe slight dropoff comes after West Ranch finished 12th of 26 teams at the Clovis Invitational on Saturday. West Ranch was competing in the prestigious event without three of its top seven runners, most notably senior Ryan Painter, who is among the state’s elite individually. \nAt the same meet, the West Ranch girls took 21st of 25 teams. Given how elite the field was, that result pushed West Ranch to the No. 10 spot in Division 2 for its first appearance in the rankings this season. \nThe Saugus girls cross country team stood tall at No. 1 after winning the varsity Division 1 and 2 race at the Santa Clarita Valley Invitational on Saturday at Castaic Lake. \nJunior Kaylee Thompson made her 2015 varsity debut in the race after she completed the CIF-mandated 30-day sit-out period because of her transfer from Valencia High. She performed well for Saugus, placing fifth overall in 18 minutes, 17.22 seconds and coming in as her team’s No. 3 finisher just behind Sydney Suarez (third, 18:11.12) and Ashley Heys (fourth, 18:11.94). \nAlso at the SCV Invite, the Saugus boys (seventh in Division 2) came in at second in the boys varsity Division 1 and 2 race. \nThe Valencia girls tennis team took care of business last week with key Foothill League wins over Hart and West Ranch, while SCCS volleyball won its lone match last week over Heritage League foe Guidance Charter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:01:28.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
