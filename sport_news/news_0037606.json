Senior forward Ally Reynolds completed the hat trick seven minutes into the second half of Weymouth’s 4-1 victory over Milton on Thursday. The win was even sweeter because it clinched a postseason spot for Weymouth (10-2). “Obviously, it’s a goal every season,” coach John MacIntyre said of the berth in the Division 1 South Sectional tournament. “You want to get in, and for us, it’s always a goal to get in as quick as possible.” There was no question who was going to be the difference-maker for Weymouth. Reynolds found the back of the net in the first five minutes. “I want to take it to them at the beginning of the game, just so we can get the lead and hopefully settle in,” said Reynolds, who was a Patriot Ledger All-Scholastic pick last season when she led the Bay State Conference with 20 goals. Reynolds added her second strike just 6:40 later to put Weymouth up 3-0. And her third came at 33:00 of the second half to make it a 4-1 game. “I work hard all summer and in the off-season, and it’s important that my teammates can find me and give me great chances to finish it off and win the games,” said Reynolds. That hard work during the off-season has resulted in Reynolds and Co. setting their sights on a state championship. “I’m excited because we’ve been working hard for this,” she said. “It’s important that we clinched today.” Weymouth built a 2-0 advantage after freshman midfielder Emma Lynch split Milton’s D and beat goalkeeper Isabel Belash. “We always try to possess and look for our opportunity to get to the goal,” said MacIntyre. “We were smart enough in the midfield there to push the ball through.” Milton (6-6-1, 4-6-1 Bay State) trimmed the deficit to 3-1 when Chae Diani beat Weymouth junior goalkeeper Renee Finnigan on a free kick. Milton didn’t have many chances in the first half. Senior forward Sophie Cousineau sent a cross to Olivia Regan, but the shot was over the net. So what made Weymouth so difficult to defend? “Ally Reynolds,” said Milton head coach Brian Borde. “She’s played well and she showed class today. She was good, she created a lot of problems and she’s a difference-maker.” Milton had its fair share of set pieces in the second half, but wasn’t able to produce any real threats. Diani took a penalty kick with 3:15 to go, but missed the net wide left. Page 2 of 2 - Weymouth kept Cousineau off the board – no small feat considering that she had three hat tricks in an eight-day span earlier this season. “It’s senior season, and I’m really motivated to start out strong,” said Cousineau. “I want it. I want the goals. I want to help the team succeed.” Even with the loss, Milton also has a postseason ticket already punched. “We achieved that goal, and now we’re playing for seeding,” added Cousineau. “In the past years, we’ve been the last seed playing number-one teams. So now we’re trying to move up and play the lower teams.” Milton next sees Walpole on Tuesday. And for Borde, there’s already one glaring positive. “We’re not playing Ally Reynolds” in that one, he said. “We’ll play straight up. We’ll play 4-3-3 and hope to break them down. Last time we lost to them 1-0, and we’ll try to play better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:46:50.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
