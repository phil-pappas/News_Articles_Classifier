Get ready to load up the DVR, dim the lights, and settle in for a week of terrific terror.\n(Note: Many of the movies below air several times during the week; check listings if these times don't work for you.)\nOCTOBER 24\n\"Paranormal Activity\" : The 2007 \"found footage,\" low-budget chiller about a couple who are convinced something super-creepy is going on in their house.

Marvel at the animators' expertise and follow the story of a boy who speaks to the dead, and a zombie uprising. (7 a.m. ABC Family)\n\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\": The Halloweentown classic, featuring superb animation, and a great Danny Elfman musical score. (11 a.m. ABC Family)\nOCTOBER 26\n\"The Cabin in the Woods\": It's another bad-things-happen-in-the-forest tale, but with new cleverness, thanks to co-writers Joss Whedon (\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"The Avengers\") and Drew Goddard.
