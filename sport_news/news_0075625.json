A A A \nThe tears started to fall. \nThe ones the young soccer star had worried about as his journey from Malawi to the United States neared. \nNot his own. His mother’s. \nWho did the then-21-year-old know in the U.S.? How would he adjust? \nChristina Mahowa waved goodbye to Humphrey Mahowa that day in 2014, and, thousands of miles later, The Master’s College welcomed one of its best international men’s soccer players ever — one that won Golden State Athletic Conference Player of the Year honors as a freshman and is tearing toward the award again as a sophomore. \nBut why TMC? \n“What made me come here was that for some reason I thought, ‘Hey, maybe God is calling me to do something (like this),” Mahowa says. \nThe circumstances certainly aligned. \nThe short of it is that a former TMC soccer player met Mahowa in Malawi, a small country in Southeastern Africa, and raved to the Mustangs’ head coach upon his return. \nThe long of it involves a Malawian boy with a dream to play professional soccer, the skills to back it up and a soccer-loving nonprofit founder. \nMahowa wants to one day return and give back to his community. But for now he’s keeping the Mustangs in the hunt for their first regular season GSAC title since 2009. \n“He just glides — very skilled, very special,” says TMC head coach Jim Rickard. \nImmediate impact \nJust how special? \n“He’s definitely what we’d call a ‘blue chipper,’” Rickard says of Mahowa. “A blue chip player as an international, that’s pretty much all you want to get.” \nThat’s because it’s difficult just to get them to the school — what with finances, paperwork and a huge culture shift. \nBut Mahowa’s been more than worth it. \nEntering Wednesday, the forward led the GSAC in points (26), goals (11) and game-winning goals (4) — the most recent of which came against NAIA then-No. 3 ranked Vanguard on Oct. 10. \n“He is quick, technical and explosive and really dangerous on the drive in two-on-two’s and one-on-one’s,” says TMC midfielder Joey Mikulas. “He’s good with combination play in tight areas.” \nAs a freshman in 2014, Mahowa led the GSAC in goals with 13, won the league’s top individual honor and propelled TMC on a surprise run to the GSAC title match (TMC lost 2-0 to Vanguard). \n“He was legit,” Rickard says of Mahowa’s first year. “... I tried to tell people to be very low key with him. I didn’t want him to have a lot of pressure his first year with the culture change.” \nThat change was difficult, Mahowa admits, citing the four or five months it took him to adjust to a new diet. \nHe missed his family, too. \n“He used to say, ‘(I’m) always going to miss my family, so why does it matter if I’m always worrying about my family? My family is taken care of. God has them,” Mahowa’s roommate as a freshman, Jack Holmlund recalls. \nApparently, Rickard had nothing to worry about either. \nA Mustang meeting \nThey wet down the dirt. \nBut dust kept kicking up as the soccer ball skipped from one player to another. \nThere were holes here and there. And the ball at times blended into the uneven surface. \nOne particular player glided, though. \n“When he’s running, he looks like he’s running in slow motion, but he’s blowing by people,” Holmlund, a member of TMC’s soccer team last season, says of Mahowa. \nHolmlund watched Mahowa in awe that 2013 summer day in Malawi as part of a church mission trip to the landlocked African nation. \nPart of the trip was reaching out, using soccer, to Mahowa’s community, Chinsapo — a suburb of the country’s capital, Lilongwe. \nGlobal Finance Magazine recently ranked Malawi as the third poorest country in the world. \nAnd even then, Chinsapo is considered especially poor. \nMahowa was born there to Alex and Christina Mahowa, the ninth youngest of 10 (Steven, Arnold, Glyn, Moses, Ednah, Reuben, Caleb, Grace, Humphrey and Emmanuel). \nThe Mahowa’s farmed land roughly 20 to 30 minutes by car from their home. \nMost of the corn, beans and groundnuts were harvested for themselves, but Alex would take a portion of it, along with mangos and lettuce he bought from other farmers, and sell it to support the family. \nMahowa helped out in addition to going to school and spending hours on soccer, the sport which — in the form of slightly wrinkled magazine and newspaper clippings — occupied the bedroom wall he shared with two brothers. \nMahowa started playing soccer at roughly age 5, joining neighborhood kids in taking on different neighborhoods. The sport got more organized as he progressed to high school. \nThen, as a junior, he met Noel Musicha. \nMusicha — a Malawian who years earlier moved to the U.S. to play soccer — is the founder of Chisomo Idea, a nonprofit that works in impoverished African communities. \nMusicha, too, was taken by Mahowa’s athletic ability, so much so that he made a documentary about Mahowa. \nEntitled “Don’t Write Me Off,” the film looks at Mahowa’s life in Chinsapo and soccer aspirations. \nUltimately, Chisomo helped Mahowa pursue his dream, organizing donors to send him to African Bible College in Lilongwe. \nThen, in the summer of 2013, he met Holmlund, who returned to the states telling Rickard of a player the 25th-year coach had to get in contact with. \n“Can this guy play?” Rickard recalls asking. “... I was at the point with my team that I really needed to get a blue chipper.” \nThere were concerns about making a scholarship work (Mahowa is on a “very large” scholarship,” Rickard says), making sure he was NAIA eligible, and the need for Mahowa to raise his own funds for other necessities like a plane ticket. \nThen spring came. \n“I said, ‘OK, we’re doing it, whatever it takes. Just get him here,’” Rickard says. \nThe results speak for themselves. The GSAC third-place Mustangs are a balanced bunch, but Mahowa is the headliner — as he is for Chisomo Idea’s scholar athlete program which helped raise funds to get him get here. \nMahowa hopes — after playing soccer professionally — to be a part of such a ministry one day. \n“(I want) to actually be one of the people that reaches out to the community that I come from and the poor communities in Africa,” Mahowa says. “That’s my goal. I want to help people whose kids are going through the same kind of life that I went through.” \nSuch work would likely bring a different kind of tear to his mother’s eye.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:48:47.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
