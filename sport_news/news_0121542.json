The Patriot girls finished seventh as a team with 194 points with all six teams ahead of them being considerably larger than the Group 1 Patriots. “Seventh for us as a school is a good finish,” said first-year Patriot coach Jessica Loughlin. “Since we’re in the NJAC (Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference) we don’t get a chance to run against big schools like Hunterdon Central and North Hunterdon. But it’s good for us to get the chance to do so, and I think the girls on the edge of breaking out as a team. We had a sophomore, Nicole Ohannesian , finish 12th today (in 20:21) and I really think she’s going to shine at our league meet Tuesday (at Greystone Park in Morris County).” The Patriots are shooting for their fourth straight North 1 Group 1 section title and may well be on track for it. \nOne to watch. Looks like Voorhees has another in the Vikings’ long, long line of gifted cross country athletes. Freshman Lauren Wagner , whose performances have impressed all season, took third in 19:26 and ran a steady race on a rugged course. She looks ready to compete in the postseason at a very high level. \nPhillipsburg’s pack effective. The Stateliners finished sixth with 134 points, which may have been a tad disappointing for the well-supported P’burg girls and their numerous fans. However, the Stateliners did the best of any team that lacked a top-15 finisher, and their top five finished in a spread of 73 seconds from senior Lexee Willey in 19th in 20:54 to sophomore Bella Beviss in 37th in 22:07, which isn’t bad. Delaware Valley (105 points Thursday) and Voorhees (115) could be catchable at the Skyland meet if the Stateliners pick it up a notch. \nA great meet. Everyone at the Phillipsburg Athletic Complex from officials to fans to athletes to parents talked about what a well-run operation the meet was from start to finish. Kudos to everyone at P’burg who made the H/W/S such a success. \nTry the chili. Loved the white-bean chicken chili. Don't miss it next year. Hat tip to Stateliner coach Joe Grady for the suggestion!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:51:26.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
