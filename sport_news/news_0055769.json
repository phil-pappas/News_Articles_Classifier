I thought we went through a good process there, developing the team. My boss, Glen [Sather], decided he wanted to go in a different direction, and that’s all part of the business, as far as coaches are concerned.\n“You pick up, you move on and you hope to get another opportunity. I was fortunate enough in Vancouver to get that.”\nTortorella’s time with the Canucks saw them fall from third to 12th place overall in the Western Conference standings and miss the playoffs for the first time in five years. There were four years remaining on Tortorella’s contract when he was fired.\nHe promised he has learned from the past and said of his time in Vancouver: “It started off very well there. That second half, I did not do a good enough job of trying to find ways to scratch out some wins when we had our injuries. Quite honestly, I should have been fired.\n“But you need to have some thick skin in our business … You learn, you move on, you keep your convictions, but you also sprinkle in some things you may have to improve on – and maybe eliminate some of the things you’re doing. That’s how I always go about these things.”\nTortorella, who won a Stanley Cup in 2004 coaching the Tampa Bay Lightning, signed a contract with Columbus that will carry him through the end of the 2017-18 season. He will make his Blue Jackets debut on Thursday in Minnesota against the Wild.\nThe Jackets currently have the worst defensive record in the NHL, having surrendered 34 goals in seven games. Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky, a former Vezina Trophy-winner, spoke publicly of his lost confidence recently – he currently has the worst goals-against average in the NHL.\nTortorella hadn’t spoken to Bobrovsky one on one as of midday Wednesday, but said: “I read the same comments and I think that’s going through the team, as far as lack of confidence. These guys care – and when it’s not going well, they feel like they’re letting people down. They feel like they let Richie [Todd Richards] down. They liked him.\n“Confidence is an easy word to say, but it’s a pretty difficult thing to gain back. [Bobrovsky] has a good game, a good period, it’s going to come back to him. We just need to play better around him and, hopefully, he’ll feel his way back into it, and have a couple of good games.”\nPresumably, the same could be said of Tortorella. He’ll need to feel his way back in and find a way to do what he couldn’t in Vancouver, which is to say, win some games.\nFollow Eric Duhatschek on Twitter: @eduhatschek\n More Related to this Story Former Canucks coach John Tortorella to coach U.S. World Cup hockey team: report\nMaple Leafs beat Blue Jackets 6-3 for first win of the season\nTopics: National Hockey League Columbus Blue Jackets John Tortorella Comments Print /\nLicense A A", "external_links": ["http://license.icopyright.net/3.8425?icx_id=26901487", "https://twitter.com/@eduhatschek", "http://license.icopyright.net/g2/3.8425?icx_id=26901487"], "published": "2015-10-21T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:07:30.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
