Three points is better but one point is good,\" Dutchman Van Gaal told a news conference. \nConsidering United went on to lose to PSV, putting them immediately under pressure, Van Gaal will hope those words do not come back to bite him. \nThe squad arrived late on Tuesday after leaving it until the last minute to fly to the Russian capital -- scene of their 2008 triumph in the final against Chelsea. \nIt gives the three-times European champions scant time to get used to conditions at the Arena Khimki, not the Luzhniki Stadium where they beat Chelsea because that is under reconstruction for the 2018 World Cup. Manchester United's coach Louis van Gaal speaks during a news conference on the eve of their Champions League Group B soccer match against CSKA Moscow at the Arena Khimki stadium outside Moscow on Tuesday.

This is a different group of players, but hopefully myself and Michael Carrick, who also won it here, can share our experience and help the others.\" \nUnited will be without James Wilson, Ashley Young and Paddy McNair for Wednesday's game. \nWinger Young was injured against Arsenal before the international break while 20-year-old defender McNair is still recovering from the abdominal injury he suffered while playing for Northern Ireland. \nStriker Wilson is ill and despite training on Tuesday, was left at home by Van Gaal. \nAll four teams in Group B have three points after two games.
