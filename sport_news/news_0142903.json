The Bearcats return their top 8 scorers from last season. \nThat includes their leading scorer that didn't get the chance to play in conference play. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nSophomore Dusan Perovic has returned from a torn ACL last winter, and he's ecstatic just to be back on the court. \n\"It feels great. I can't describe how actually happy I am to be back on the court, to be back with my teammates,\" said Perovic on Wednesday. \"It just feels amazing. After all the tough eight months with the rehab and everything, to actually be on the court again is just amazing.\" \nBut the Bearcats expect his return to be a key to boosting their offensive production. \nAt 6'9\", Perovic has shown the ability to stretch the floor as well as play inside. That skill set has made his return an important one for the Bearcats. \n\"He gives us size in there. He stretches the defense,\" said head coach Tommy Dempsey. \"When he's on the court and he's at 22 feet and they're guarding him, which will open up lanes for Walker, opens up lanes for McFadden, it opens up lanes for Rodriguez and those guys to get to the basket. So we really have a much better balance of inside-out and Dusan will help provide that.\" \nThe Bearcats still have more than a month until their season opener on Nov. 13. \nYacob, McFadden hurt for the Bearcats Junior Yosef Yacob and sophomore Justin McFadden are both not practicing at the moment for Binghamton. \nCoach Dempsey told the media on Wednesday that Yacob is out with a torn labrum. \nAccording to Dempsey, Yacob has an MRI this week. If he needs surgery, he could miss the entire 2015-16 season. If Yacob avoids surgery he could be back in about a month. \nMcFadden suffered what he called a minor concussion in practice on Tuesday. He expects to only be out about a week or two.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:27:32.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
