(CBS12) - Stephanie Carter's first love was soccer, but she eventually discovered that volleyball was the sport for her. The CBS12 Athlete of the Week is now among the best team players in the area.While every volleyball player loves to slam down a point for her team, there's a lot more to Stephanie Carter.\"She's the first to set up, she's the first to tear down,\" says Jupiter head volleyball coach Blane Betz. \"She's the last one to put away, she's always encouraging those when she's in the rotation or when she's on the bench. She's always about everybody else and making sure everyone else is playing their best volleyball before it's about her.\"\"If I can do like one good deed on the day and put someone else before me and not worry about myself and be like selfless that's what god wants me to do is put others first,\" says Carter.Off the volleyball court carter recently headed up a fundraiser in honor of her club coach Terri Kaiser who's battling breast cancer.\"Terri means the world to me and I have a lot of family members that had breast cancer. They're fighting such a hard battle and if I can just give a little bit for them and help just raise a little bit of money you know it might go a long way.\"But there's still plenty of energy and drive left to be the player she needs to be to help Uupiter win states.\"It's the best feeling that I can even describe - definitely instead of crying this year when we lose. I want to be able to be cheering and winning states.\"\"She wants to do everything that she does to the best of her ability,\" says Betz. \"She's just a very inspired individual and I appreciate that very much.\" Athlete of the Week: Jupiter's Stephanie Carter \nWednesday, October 7 2015, 04:48 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:55:31.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
