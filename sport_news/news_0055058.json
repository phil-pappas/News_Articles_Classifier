They were a close fourth behind the U.S. last year. \nDaniel Purvis led all-around qualifying with a score of 88.956. Teammates Max Whitlock and Nile Wilson tied for second with totals of 88.365. Whitlock, the defending world all-around silver medalist, will advance to the finals based on a tiebreaker that dropped each gymnast's lowest score. \nDefending champion China and powerful Japan are schedule to qualify later Sunday. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:43:19.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
