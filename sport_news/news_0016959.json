I'm a lot more relaxed and it's going a lot better. Accuracy is improving immensely in practice.\" \nHis progress became evident on Saturday at Air Force midway through the second quarter. \nFollowing a fumble recovery, Wyoming began a drive at the Falcons' 15-yard line, which would have amounted to a fairly comfortable 32-yard field goal. \nThe Cowboys threw incomplete passes on the first two downs and senior quarterback Cameron Coffman took a 9-yard sack on third down. \nUW coach Craig Bohl brought out Bailey for a 41-yard field-goal attempt on fourth down. \nMissing four kicks between 38 and 43 yards did nothing to diminish Bailey's confidence. \nKicking from between the hash marks, Bailey visualized a straight kick through the goal posts, and for the first time in his young career, he delivered. \n\"My thoughts didn't really change too much (after Coffman's sack),\" said Bailey, from Colorado Springs, Colorado. \"I just knew I had to get the kick in and I could do it. \n\"Pushing it back there, I think it was meant to happen just because that's where I've been struggling, at those distances. It just kind of pushed me over that edge.\" \nWyoming's field-goal unit erupted when the ball split the uprights, as did its sideline. Even the assistants in the Cowboys' coaching box let out a roar. \n\"It's a lot different feeling than coming off and (hearing), 'Hey, you'll get the next one,'\" Bailey said. \"It was a great feeling, like, 'Yeah, you did it. You got it. We needed that.'\" \nBohl, who works directly with Wyoming's kickers and punters, beamed a wide smile during his press conference Monday when Bailey's field goal was brought up. \n\"Nothing builds success like success,\" Bohl said. \"... I think it took a big, big burden off his shoulders.\" \nUW offensive coordinator Brent Vigen said getting the monkey off Bailey's back may instill more confidence in his offense, too. \nThe Cowboys' abysmal red-zone production rate — they have scored on just 12 of 22 red-zone trips — could improve if Bailey remains consistent. \nVigen said his play-calling might change as well. \n\"Your sense of production in the drive if you can cap it off with three (points) instead of a goose egg is big,\" he said. \"As we get in that 15- to 25-yard line area, it may change our mindset just a little bit.\" \nBailey said his mindset, too, has changed. \nLike a cold shooter in basketball who finds confidence from seeing a shot go through the hoop, a kicker builds similar self-belief from watching a football split the uprights. \n\"It definitely does boost my confidence, having that feeling of getting over a little slump and feeling like it's done with now,\" he said. \"It's just focusing on every kick, and the next kick is the one that matters.\" \nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)
