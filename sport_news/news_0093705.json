The 6-foot-4 guard made 8 of 10 shots and was 13 of 16 from the free throw line. Matthew Dellevedova scored 13 points. The Cavaliers blew a 19-point lead. \n76ERS: Wilbekin's winner was his only shot attempt of the game. Jeremi Grant had 19 points and Nerlens Noel grabbed 10 rebounds. \nSTAR WATCH: Stars? What stars? LeBron James sat out. So did Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love . Same with J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov . The few fans sitting behind Cleveland's bench went wild when James took his seat just before tipoff. James mostly stood around with his arms folded during timeouts. \nSAY WHAT?: Allen Iverson, whose retired No. 3 hangs from the rafters, was interviewed from a seat in the suite. Iverson mumbled his way through the interview and was inaudible throughout the arena. Some fans booed. \nUP NEXT: Philadelphia plays Brooklyn on Saturday in Albany, New York. Cavaliers play Memphis on Monday in Columbus, Ohio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:03:42.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
