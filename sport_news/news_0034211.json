When was Kyle Flood's first exposure to Urban Meyer's offensive philosophy?\nWhen Flood was an assistant to Greg Schiano, Meyer, then the Florida coach, visited Rutgers practice and expounded on his ideas that you get the ball to your playmakers in space. Now Flood must contain Ohio State's playmakers.\n2. What's Rutgers' situation at quarterback as it goes forward in recruiting?\nStarter Chris Laviano and three of his backups are underclassmen, and the Scarlet Knights are high on Anthony Russo, a 6-foot-3, 230-pounder from Warminster, Pa., who has verbally committed to RU.\n3. What are the latest rumors on the recruiting of Paramus Catholic's Rashan Gary?\nThat Michigan and LSU have a slight edge on his other suitors. For his part, Gary is arranging his official visits and says he'll either declare at the Under Armour All-Star game in January or wait until signing day in February.\n4. How high a priority has Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh put on landing Gary?\nSo high that with the Wolverines off this week, Harbaugh was in Florida on Friday night to watch Gary and Paramus Catholic play IMG Academy. Remember, Harbaugh hired Chris Partridge, Gary's high school coach, for his Michigan staff.\n5. How embarrassed was Kansas State's Bill Snyder about losing 55-0 to Oklahoma?\nEnough that the legendary Wildcats coach sent a letter to the student body apologizing for the team's performance. He also thanked them for caring about the program. Wonder if K-State's big boosters received apologies?\n6. What true freshman from New Jersey has developed into a budding star at Alabama?\nSt. Peter's Prep grad Minkah Fitzpatrick, a five-star recruit from Old Bridge, returned interceptions 33 and 55 yards for touchdowns in the Tide's win over Texas A&M. Fitzpatrick became a starting cornerback in the second game.\n7. Did Rutgers try to recruit Iowa running back Akrum Wadley, who's from Newark?\nWadley said Rutgers showed some interest, but Temple was the only other school besides Iowa to offer a scholarship to the former Weequahic star. The sophomore, filling in for an injured starter, rushed for 204 yards against Northwestern.\n8. How did South Carolina react to Steve Spurrier being at the Michigan State-Michigan game?\nPublicly, South Carolina officials didn't say anything, but they couldn't have been happy that Spurrier was there several days after walking away from the Gamecocks job. The scuttlebutt is that Spurrier is looking for a TV analyst job.\n9. What's caused Mississippi's two-loss slide since its upset victory over Alabama?\nBesides a unusual rash of injuries, the Rebels have allowed 31 points a game in SEC play and missed 30 tackles in last week's loss to Memphis. Plus the quality of quarterback Chad Kelly's play has fallen off considerably.\n10. How can Division III Mount Union of Ohio make history by winning today?\nIf Mount Union beats Wilmington (Ohio), it will be its 100th consecutive regular-season win. Mount Union hasn't lost a regular-season game since October 2005. From 2000-2003, Mount Union won a record 55 games in a row.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:23.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
