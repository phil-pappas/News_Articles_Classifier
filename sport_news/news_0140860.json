It may have been, it may have not,” Hourcade said of the pass for Ashley-Cooper’s third try. \n“It’s in the past and we just need to accept it. The referee’s decisions cannot be questioned. \n“If we had scored a try at any point I think we could have won the game, but Australia played very well and congratulations to them for their win.” \nHourcade met the final whistle with tears at Argentina’s exit, but quickly refocused for Friday night’s third-place play-off against South Africa. \nSpringboks boss Heyneke Meyer branded contesting the third-place match “like kissing your sister”, but Hourcade insisted Argentina would throw everything at victory. \n“The players were very committed, very engaged they never game up looking for that try,” Hourcade said. \n“We feel a huge pain because we were very excited and emotional. \n“But I feel very proud about these players and I think it hurts more for them to lose than it hurts me. \n“I can’t remember if I was crying or not, but I was feeling for them because they gave everything. I really congratulate them because they left their lives out there. \n“For us, the third-place play-off means a lot. Every game means a lot. In every game, we’re trying to reach the top. \n“It would be fantastic to beat such a great team as South Africa if we could manage it.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:40:25.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
