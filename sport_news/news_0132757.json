She says video has both proven and disproven claims. More than half of the complaints that had accompanying video were substantiated.\nThe CCRB wants officers to wear body cameras every time they enter a home and to install surveillance cameras in police stations.\nPatrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch says there has been a 19 percent reduction in complaints against officers. He says the complaints are a small number compared to the number of interactions with officers.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:46:30.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
