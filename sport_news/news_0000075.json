Utley was on the bench and didn't play in the Dodgers' 13-7 loss Monday night.\nUtley will be eligible to play for the rest of the best-of-five NL Division Series against the Mets, who led 2-1 going into Game 4 Tuesday night.\n\"The fact that they felt the play was unnecessary and they did what they did was enough,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"Now we've moved past it, and you got to get ready to play.\"\nJohn McHale Jr., the baseball executive who will hear the appeal, informed MLB and the players' union of the timing of the hearing on Tuesday.\nIf the Dodgers' postseason is over at the time of the decision, any suspension that is upheld would be served at the start of the 2016 regular season.\nMets fans greeted Utley a former Philadelphia star, with loud booing and profane chants before and during Game 3.\n\"He played at Philly,\" Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. \"You play in Philly, I mean this is the same. Right? I think he was fine.\"\nUtley did not speak with reporters after Game 3.\n\"I know people are still probably up in arms about the whole thing, but I know Chase, he felt horrible about the kid getting hurt,\" Mattingly said. \"That's one of the things, I think guys that play the game hard, they feel like they play the game right. ... They want to play like that, but they're not looking to hurt anybody.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
