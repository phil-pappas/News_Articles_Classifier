And that matches last year,\" Johnson said. \nJohnson says if you already have a full-time job, but are still looking for extra work, make sure you are up front about your availability. \n\"A lot of the seasonal businesses, retailers, and others, they need you for many hours during the holiday season,\" Johnson said. \"So be firm in your mind about what you want to get out of this season employment opportunity.\" \nAnd it's an opportunity that can lead to something more long term. \n\"Some of them can become permanent positions. We do have a limited number of positions, but we do also keep some on,\" Van Alyne said. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
