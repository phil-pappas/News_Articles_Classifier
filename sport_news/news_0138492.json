Host Harriman could not convert its opportunity into points.\nThat told the tale of what would follow as Greenback captured the region title with a 49-28 victory.\nWillis passed for 266 yards in the first half and had three touchdown passes to T.J. Jones that covered 38, 53 and 65 yards to put the Cherokees (7-2, 5-0) up 28-0 at the break.\nWillis also had a 10-yard scoring strike to Kayne Roberts in the third quarter and a 36-yard touchdown pass to Jones late in the fourth.\n\"Tonight we knew with some injuries we were going to have to step back and throw the ball, and I just wanted to do the best I could,\" said Willis.\nHis coach, Brent Kilpatrick, was pleased with Willis' breakout performance.\n\"He has not really gotten the credit he deserves,\" he said.\nFor Harriman (6-3, 4-1), which still will host a first-round playoff game, the storyline was missed scoring opportunities.\nThe Blue Devils were stopped near the Greenback goal two additional times before finally scoring on a 3-yard TD run by T.J. Phipps in the third quarter.\nThey rallied somewhat with three fourth-quarter touchdowns on short runs by Joe Joe Luna and Joe Pace, and a 17-yard TD pass from Pace to Bobby Jackson.\n\"I'm proud of my kids for fighting back,\" said Harriman coach Travis Tapp.\nIn the first quarter, the game was delayed for about 10 minutes when Greenback lineman Michael Thacker had to be taken off the field on a cart following a leg injury that he suffered several plays earlier.\nJohn Shearer is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:23:41.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
