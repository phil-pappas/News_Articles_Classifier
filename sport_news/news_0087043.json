Christie and his wife, Mary Pat, earned nearly $1 million last year, up from about $700,000 in 2013, according to tax returns released by his office on Friday.\nChristie, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president in 2016, was paid a salary of $175,000 in 2014 as the state's chief executive. However, he contributes a portion of that to a 401(k), so he reported a bit less.\nMary Pat Christie made about $720,000 working as managing director for the New York investment firm Angelo Gordon & Co. She also earned about $35,000 from Cantor Fitzgerald, where she worked before moving to Angelo. She resigned from Angelo in April, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family.\nThe Christies, who were granted a six-month extension to file, reported total income of $970,161 and paid $283,535 in federal taxes, plus $117,053 in taxes to New York and New Jersey. Their effective federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.\nMore coverage Christie: I'd rather jump off bridge than be in Congress Super PAC targets SJ Assembly races Editorial: Storms took N.J. to class NJ files eminent domain vs. Margate The Christies reported total salaries and wages of $912,460, plus nearly $8,000 in dividends from investments held in a blind trust, about $13,000 in capital gains, and more than $25,000 in royalties, among other sources of income.\nThe couple gave $27,600 to charity, according to the 88-page document.\nPresidential candidates must file financial disclosure forms with the Federal Election Commission but are not required to release their tax returns. Similarly, the governor must file financial disclosure forms but isn't required to release his tax returns. Christie's office said he had done so in the spirit of transparency. During his first run for governor in 2009, Christie released his tax returns dating back to 2003. He has disclosed his returns each year since.\nMost serious presidential candidates eventually release their returns. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is also seeking the GOP nomination, released 33 years of his tax returns on June 30 - the same day Christie announced his candidacy.\nLt. Gov. Kim Guadagno also released her 2014 tax returns on Friday. She and her husband, Michael, an Appellate Division judge, reported total income of $331,742.\naseidman@phillynews.com\n856-779-3846\n@AndrewSeidman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:13:04.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
