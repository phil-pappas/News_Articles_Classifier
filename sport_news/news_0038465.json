They play the winner of Game 5 between Houston and Kansas City later Wednesday. Game 1 of the ALCS is Friday night.\nBautista's homer capped an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when Toronto catcher Russell Martin 's throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking to score.\n\"It's the most emotionally charged game that I've ever played,\" Bautista said.\nThe Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay.\nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making three straight errors, and Toronto rallied. Benches cleared twice in the Blue Jays' half of the inning.\nRoberto Osuna got the final five outs for his first postseason save. He turned toward the outfield after striking out Wil Venable, looked to the sky and was mobbed by his teammates.\nBautista glared at Rangers reliever Sam Dyson as he stood at home plate to admire his go-ahead drive, enthusiastically flipping his bat away.\nWith some fans continuing to litter the field, Edwin Encarnacion turned to face the crowd and appealed for calm, lifting his bat and helmet over his head. Dyson took exception and walked over to confront Encarnacion, leading to both dugouts and both bullpens emptying.\nThe inning ended when Troy Tulowitzki fouled out. Dyson made contact with Tulowitzki as he walked off, leading to another benches-clearing confrontation.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/52/8792717/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/52/8792717/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:36:30.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
