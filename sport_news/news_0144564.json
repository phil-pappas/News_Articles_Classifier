The Jays had been in the playoffs in 1985, 1989 and 1991 and fans were getting sick of the team being unable to seal the deal.\nThere was no talk of jumping on bandwagons, raising flags or playing hooky — there was only talk of winning.\n“In some cities, merely getting the chance would be enough. In cities like Cleveland, Seattle and San Diego, winning a division title would mean outright success.\nIn Toronto, it means: ‘Let's see what you can do now’,” the Star wrote on Oct. 6, 1992, before the first game of the playoffs.\nAnother reason why Toronto may be more team-Jays this time around is that the Toronto Maple Leafs actually stood a chance in 1992. The Leafs had begun an upswing under the guidance of GM Cliff Fletcher that would lead to some of the team’s strongest seasons in recent memory.\nRelated video The two sports had to fight over viewers, something the Leafs gracefully acknowledged when they moved their season opener at Maple Leaf Gardens up a day to let the Jays shine in the playoffs.\n“Arguments can, and do, go either way. What's left at the end is the realization that Toronto is both a great hockey town and a great baseball town,” the Star wrote.\nBut after Toronto won the World Series for the first time, the city’s tune swiftly changed from cautiously optimistic about the Jays to recklessly ecstatic. By the time the Jays were in the playoffs again in 1993, fans were lining up to see what they could do.\nThe first game of the playoffs was an away game, and more than 14,000 fans poured into the SkyDome to watch the game (for free) on the big screen.\n“You can't go there (Chicago), so this is the next best thing. Obviously, a lot of other people like it. There's so much enthusiasm here,” Sharon Carlos told the Star on Oct. 6, 1993.\nIt was only the fifth time the SkyDome’s big screen was made open to the public for out-of-town games — the first being Game Six of the World Series when the Jays became champions.\nWith files from Star staff\nCorrection - October 8, 2015: This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly said the Jays made the playoffs in 1987.\nMore on thestar.com\nOk Blue Jays anthem written when the team was just ‘OK’\nRoof closed for Blue Jays-Rangers ALDS Game 1, and other tidbits", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1548982&ThemeId=16875"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:41:30.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
