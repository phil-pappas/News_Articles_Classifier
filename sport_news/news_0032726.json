Image 11 of 11 Upset gets RPI untracked 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Troy\nIf Sunday's home opener against the top-ranked team in the country was to serve as a barometer for RPI's coming season, the forecast would have to be considered sunny with a reasonable chance of success.\nThe Engineers, picked to finish 10th in the ECAC, shocked No. 1 Boston College 2-1 Sunday at Houston Field House in one of the biggest upsets of the Seth Appert era in Troy.\nJunior Riley Bourbonnais scored both goals for RPI (1-1-0) and senior goaltender Jason Kasdorf was brilliant in the nets with 36 saves as the Engineers held off the team with the most drafted players (13) of any college team in the country. It marked the fourth consecutive time RPI beat BC in this building, the last time 20 years ago.\nMore Information\nRPI 2, Boston College 1\nBC 0 0 1 — 1\nRPI 0 1 1 — 2\nFirst period — No scoring. Penalties—Tironese, RPI (interference) 4:08; Calnan, BC (holding) 8:15; Calnan, BC (tripping) 12:21.\nSecond period—1, RPI, Bourbonnais 1 (Tironese, Reno) 19: 14. Penalties—Gaudreau, BC (interference) 6:54; Bubela, RPI (boarding) 8:58; Tironese, RPI (tripping) 13:00.\nThird Period—2, RPI, Bourbonnais 2 (Tironese, Wilson) 3: 02 (pp). 3, Boston College, Sanford 2 (Doherty, Tuch) 8:36 (pp). Penalties—Fitzgerald, BC (elbowing) 1:45; Liljegren, RPI (hooking) 4:38; Wilson, RPI (slashing) 7:28.\nShots on goal—Boston College 13-16-8—37. RPI 13-7-8--28.\nPower-play opportunities—BC 1-for-5. RPI 1-for-4.\nGoaltenders—Boston College, Demko 1-1-0 (28 shots-26 saves). RPI, Kasdorf 0-1-0 (37-36).\nT—2: 04. A— 2,770.\n\"It's an awesome feeling,\" said Bourbonnais, who scored a hat trick against Union College a little more than a year ago. \"There's nothing better than that. You know you're up 2-nothing there and the team's going, so it's just great. We need to get better, but it's great momentum going into Alaska (Brice Alaska Gold Rush tournament) next weekend.\nAfter a scoreless first period during which both teams took 13 shots, RPI continued to play great defense and ride the stellar goaltending of Kasdorf into the second period, finally getting rewarded with less than 56 seconds remaining.\nBourbonnais took a pass from freshman Evan Tironese and fired a shot from the right circle that goalie Thatcher Demko couldn't locate with Tironese following in to screen the goaltender. It was RPI's first goal of the season after a 3-0 loss at Lowell on Friday.\nKasdorf, meanwhile, stopped all 16 shots he faced in the middle period, his best saves coming on a six-shot flurry during a relentless BC power play at the 13-minute mark.\nBourbonnais made it 2-0 at 3:02 of the third period when he scored in the slot on a power play, taking the assist from Tironese again. It stayed that way until Zach Sanford cut the lead in half on a power play for BC at 8:36, beating Kasdorf at the right post.\nThe Eagles, the defending NCAA champions, called a timeout with 1:20 to play and replaced Demko with a sixth skater, but Kasdorf and a pesky defense kept them at bay to secure the victory.\n\"I thought it was a good game,\" said veteran BC coach Jerry York. \"Our compete level was excellent. We had a lot of opportunities, but just the one goal. RPI players blocked a lot of shots (45) and Kasdorf made some really good saves. Credit their defense; credit their blocking shots. They're a good club and they competed well.\"\nThe last time the Engineers beat a top-ranked team came on Jan. 29, 2011 when they defeated Yale 5-2 in the Big Red Freakout.\n\"It was just a good win,\" Appert understated. \"You're not playing the schedule that we have in front of us because we expect to go undefeated. You're playing it to test yourselves against the best teams in the country. Jason (Kasdorf) was what Jason is; he's our rock. You had two of the best goalies in college hockey going head-to-head today.\"\nMatt Graves is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775940/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775941/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775944/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775939/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775937/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775942/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775940/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775943/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775942/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775938/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775942/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775939/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775945/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775944/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775938/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775941/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775945/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775937/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775936/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775941/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775937/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775943/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775936/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775945/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775939/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775936/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775940/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775944/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775943/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775938/3/628x471.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:09:03.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
