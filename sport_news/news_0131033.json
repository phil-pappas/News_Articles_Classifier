(AP) â€” Seattle Seahawks running back Fred Jackson was uninjured when his car crashed outside the team's facility on Tuesday.\nThe Renton Police Department said shortly before 5 p.m. PDT on Tuesday, Jackson lost control of his 2016 Chevrolet Corvette as he drove down Seahawks Way. The crash happened about 48 hours before the Seahawks face the San Francisco 49ers in a Thursday night game.\nJackson's vehicle sustained moderate front end damage. Jackson remained on scene until officers arrived and was cooperative. He was then taken by team personnel back to the facility and did not report any injuries.\nPhotos of Jackson's car with New York license plates were seen on social media. A stop sign and street signs were knocked over in the wreck. The accident happened at the end of a long straight road with a slight bend at the end that leads from the Seahawks facility to Lake Washington Blvd. The stop sign knocked over was in front of a \"Welcome to Renton\" sign that includes the Seahawks logo.\nEarly reports indicated Jackson may have been racing with a teammate and that's what caused the accident, but Renton police say those reports are false and there was no indication that Jackson was racing.\nJackson tweeted thanks to those who expressed concern later Tuesday night and wrote he simply lost control and wasn't racing.\n\"My teammates, including Marshawn (Lynch), stopped 2 check on me,\" Jackson wrote.\nJackson signed with Seattle right before the start of the regular season after being a surprise cut by the Buffalo Bills . The move to Seattle reunited Jackson with Lynch, a teammate with the Bills.\nJackson has been used sparingly and mostly as a third-down running back with the Seahawks. He suffered a high-ankle sprain in a Monday night game against Detroit but played six days later against Cincinnati.\nJackson has 10 carries for 52 yards and 12 catches for 110 yards and a touchdown in Seattle's first six games.\n___\nAP Sports Writer John Wawrow and freelance writer Curtis Crabtree contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:41:19.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
