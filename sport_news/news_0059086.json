It will be the first surgery in Cano’s big-league career. \n“He’ll be cleared to return to all baseball activities (after six weeks),” Khalfayan said. \nAsked why he doesn’t just take the final three games off, Cano said, “I love to play baseball. I played like this for the last two months. I love the game so much. I love to be out there.” Rain postpones three MLB games \nThree major league baseball games were postponed as the East Coast faced steady rain with Hurricane Joaquin swirling in the Atlantic. \nIn New York, the Mets’ chase for home-field advantage in their opening playoff series was put on hold when their game against the Washington Nationals was called off. They were scheduled to play a split doubleheader Saturday. \nThe New York Yankees’ game in Baltimore and the Marlins-Phillies game in Philadelphia also were rained out and rescheduled as part of doubleheaders Saturday. \nHowever, that schedule may be in jeopardy as rain and wind are forecast throughout the weekend. \nTroy Tulowitzki is back in the A.L. East champion Toronto Blue Jays lineup after missing three weeks because of injuries. \nTulowitzki hasn’t played since Sept. 12, when he cracked his scapula and bruised muscles in his upper back after colliding with teammate Kevin Pillar in a game against the New York Yankees. \n“Excited to get back to playing,” he said. “Overall it’s good enough to play. It’s just like any time with an injury, probably that area is a little bit sore. To be able to swing felt good, so it tells me I’m ready.” \nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons said Tulowitzki will get Saturday off and then play in Sunday’s regular-season finale against the Rays. \n“Let’s face it, we’re a better team with him out there,” Gibbons said. White Sox expect Ventura back \nChicago White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said he expects manager Robin Ventura to return next season. \nHahn said the team will not renew the contract of bench coach Mark Parent and that assistant hitting coach Harold Baines has requested to move into an ambassador role. Ventura and the rest of the staff members are expected back next season. \n© Copyright 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
