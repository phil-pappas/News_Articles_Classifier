Bae and Hideki Matsuyama teamed for nine birdies in 11 holes for the biggest rout of the week. And the International team played the Americans to a draw in a double session Saturday to stay just one point behind. \n\"We need to win this,\" Oosthuizen said. \"This is huge for us. We believe we can do it.\" \nThe Americans have a 9 1/2-8 1/2 lead. They also have Jordan Spieth, the No. 1 player in the world. He made two clutch putts in morning foursomes to cap off the biggest comeback at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, and he made eight birdies in 14 holes in a fourballs victory in the afternoon. \nNot since the matches were tied going into Sunday in 2005 has the Presidents Cup featured a final day of drama. \n\"This is what we all came here for — for it to be exciting tomorrow,\" International captain Nick Price said. \nThe South Africans have certainly done their part, with Grace producing two critical shots. \nGrace and Oosthuizen were all square with Bubba Watson and J.B. Holmes. Grace chipped in for birdie from left of the 16th green, raising his arm before the ball reached the cup and sharing a bearhug with his childhood friend. \nDarkness began falling and Grace had no idea Oosthuizen’s second shot into the par-5 18th hole had gone into the water. Grace could barely see the green from 263 yards away with a chilly wind in his face. No matter. He smashed his 3-wood, watched it disappear and had no idea what happened until he heard a burst of cheers coming from the grandstands. \nThe ball narrowly cleared the bunker and settled on the edge of the green. \n\"I don’t know where it finished or how it got to where it did,\" Grace said. \"Just remarkable to pull a shot off like that.\" \nWatson and Holmes both missed the green, and when neither chipped in for eagle, Grace rolled his putt close enough to be conceded the birdie and a crucial win. \nThe Americans opened with a 4-1 lead Thursday and have been outplayed — but not by much — since. \n\"To me, it kind of feels like we’re losing just because of what’s gone on the last two days,\" Zach Johnson said. \"But our first day was substantial. So yeah, you knew it was going to be tight going into Sunday regardless of what happened.\" \nKorda beats heat \nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Jessica Korda took a two-stroke lead in the LPGA Malaysia, shooting a bogey-free 6-under 65 in sweltering conditions. \nKorda missed a birdie chance on the par-4 18th when her 6-footer slid by on the left side, leaving the 22-year-old American at 12-under 201 at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club. American Stacy Lewis and South Korea’s Ha Na Jang were tied for second. \nPerry’s 68 \nCARY, N.C. — Kenny Perry shot a 4-under 68 in the rain to take a one-stroke lead after two rounds in the Champions Tour’s SAS Championship. Perry had an 8-under 136 total at Prestonwood Country Club. Joe Durant was second after a 68, and first-round leader Bernhard Langer (73) was another stroke back along with Lee Janzen (68). \nFitzpatrick leads \nWOBURN, England — England’s Matthew Fitzpatrick shot a 3-under 68 to maintain a share of the lead after the third round of the British Masters. Thailand’s Kiradech Aphibarnrat had a 67 to match Fitzpatrick at 12-under 201. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:21:57.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
