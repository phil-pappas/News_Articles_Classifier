(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT \nOTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — James Neal scored twice in regulation and the shootout winner as the Nashville Predators defeated the Ottawa Senators 4-3 on Saturday night. \nNeal had two power-play goals, while Craig Smith also scored for Nashville (4-1-0). Carter Hutton, making his first start of the season, stopped 38 shots. \nMike Hoffman had a pair of goals for the Senators (3-2-1), while Mark Stone picked up the other. Craig Anderson made 22 saves. \nFor the first time this season, the Senators were not outshot by the opposition. \nWith the game tied 2-2 midway through the third, Neal scored his second power-play goal of the game in the exact same manner he scored his first in the opening period, beating Anderson short side on a wrap-around attempt to give Nashville a 3-2 lead. \nWith time winding down, Hoffman scored his second of the night, tying it 3-3 with a shot from the blue line. \nThe Senators had played a great second until a weak clearing attempt by Patrick Wiercioch allowed the Predators to tie the game 2-2 with just over two minutes remaining in the period. \nNashville's Mike Ribeiro was able to keep the puck in at the blue line and fed Smith for his third of the season. \nOttawa had taken the lead at the 12-minute mark of the second as Hoffman fired a shot from just inside the blue line. Hutton was helpless as the puck deflected off Ryan Ellis' stick. \nTo the delight of 16,895 on hand at Canadian Tire Centre, Stone tied the game 1-1 just 15 seconds into the second period, taking a pass from Kyle Turris and then going forehand to backhand to beat Hutton. \nBoth teams had a slow start, with neither creating any great chances in the opening minutes of the game. \nThe Predators opened the scoring midway through the first when Neal beat Anderson. \nNotes: D Marc Methot missed the game due to the flu, allowing Chris Wideman to make his NHL debut. ... LW Clarke MacArthur missed his second straight game due to an upper-body injury. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:15:24.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
