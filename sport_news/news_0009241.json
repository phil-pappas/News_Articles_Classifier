(Scott Schild | Sschild@syracuse.com) Comments \nThe Syracuse Crunch's run of bad luck has begun early this season. \nRookie forward Adam Erne is expected to miss at least four or five weeks after suffering an upper body injury in Friday's loss to Hartford. \nCrunch coach Rob Zettler confirmed the news to broadcaster Dan D'Uva before the Crunch's game at Utica on Saturday. \nErne was a second-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 2013 draft. Skating on the Crunch's top line this season, he had one helper in four games. \nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:20:33.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
