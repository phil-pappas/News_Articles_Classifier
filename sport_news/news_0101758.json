This makes the tax story in Clackamas County very hard to tell simply.\"\nTo help taxpayers understand their bills, Vroman is holding eight town hall meetings around the county.\nVroman said some of the biggest increases in tax bills will be seen east of Newberg, where an 8 percent increase will go to the Newberg School District to pay off existing debt. Colton property owners will see a 7.5 percent increase because Colton School District voters approved a new bond issue.\nProperty owners in the North Clackamas School District overall will see a 6.25 percent to pay off existing debt. This, in turn, will fuel a 5.75 percent in Happy Valley area and a 5.5 percent increase in Milwaukie – both in the school district.\nThe total of taxes the county will collect for all cities and districts will be $725 million, and increase of nearly 6 percent over last year's total of $684 million. But Vroman cautions that tax-limitation measures passed by Oregon voters cloud the picture for property owners looking for direct connections between real market values and their tax bills.\nVroman and his staff will also embark on their annual series of town halls from Oct. 27 to Nov. 5. They will hold eight meetings around the county to provide information and answer questions.\n\"I know the tax picture can seem confusing,\" Vroman said. \"I hope people with questions will come out so we can help them.\"\n-- Rick Bella rbella@oregonian.com\n503-294-5915; @southnewshound", "external_links": ["http://www.newberg.k12.or.us/", "https://twitter.com/southnewshound", "http://www.colton.k12.or.us/", "http://www.clackamas.us/at/", "http://www.nclack.k12.or.us/site/default.aspx?PageID=1"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:26:43.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
