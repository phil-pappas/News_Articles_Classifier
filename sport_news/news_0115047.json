Froese had been on a professional tryout contract, and earned his keep with a breakout performance first with Cincinnati, then the Marlies.\nHe was loaned for the second time last season to the Marlies, and went on to score 18 goals and 24 assists in 46 games.\nThat led to an AHL contract last January, then a two-year deal with Leafs this past summer.\n“Oh yeah, there were times for sure when you’re sent down (that you think you’ll never make the NHL).” Froese said.\n“But you try not to think that way … it’s been a rollercoaster ride, but I always try to not let people say no to me.”\nLeafs coach Mike Babcock said he has noticed Froese consistently working himself into consideration for the NHL ever since training camp; he has Froese penciled onto a line with Michael Grabner and PA Parenteau for Saturday’s game with Montreal.\nThe remaining Leaf lines shape up as follows:\nJames van Riemsdyk-Nazem Kadri-Leo Komarov\nShawn Matthias-Mark Arcobello-Brad Boyes\nDaniel Winnik-Nick Spaling-Joffrey Lupul\nIt appears Peter Holland will be a healthy scratch; Tyler Bozak and Jake Gardiner are out with undisclosed injuries. Komarov did not participate in the morning skate, but he is expected to play.\nThe defensive pairings will see Dion Phaneuf and Matt Hunwick as the top pair, followed by Morgan Rielly and Scott Harrington, then Martin Marincin and Roman Polak.\nJonathan Bernier gets the start in goal.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:34:42.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
