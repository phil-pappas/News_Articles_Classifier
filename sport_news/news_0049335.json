Sarkisian can hopefully get treatment for his problems and get right. \nSarkisian was in his second season as the Trojans' coach and posted a 12-6 overall record at USC. This season, USC has a 3-2 record including a 17-12 loss on Saturday at home to Washington. Things were bad on the field for the Trojans this season, but clearly Sarkisian was battling much bigger issues off of it. \nWhile there are massive implications with this move for one of college football's biggest and most prestigious programs, this is also a situation where a man has some demons he needs help with. Hopefully not coaching -- which is one of the most stressful, time consuming jobs there is -- will allow Sarkisian time to get treatment for his issues with alcohol and to get his life back on track. \n2. USC is the best available job on the market, by a wide margin. \nThere are rarely jobs this good that come open -- especially without a plan in place for a successor -- and whoever takes over in Los Angeles will be set up for immediate success. The Trojans have a stacked roster, are off of sanctions and have a top-10 recruiting class for 2016, according to 247Sports . \nOnly one team in the country -- Alabama -- has better recruiting talent on the roster than USC currently does, according to 247Sports and with sanctions lifted and a full amount of scholarships available adding depth behind the studs already there should be a quick process. \n3. Prepare for rumor season. \nDo you root for a successful college football program? Then your coach will probably be rumored, at some point, in connection with the USC head coaching job.\nIt's already started, not more than five minutes after the firing. \nSome names being floated: Kyle Whittingham (Utah), Rich Rodriguez (Arizona), Gary Patterson (TCU), Pat Fitzgerald (Northwestern) #USC \nâ€” InsideUSC (@InsideUSC) October 12, 2015 Those names are reasonable. You'll also see some pie in the sky suggestions, like Urban Meyer. No one is safe from USC rumors, except for one man -- Lane Kiffin. Other than that, everyone is going to be brought up in connection with this job. Just be prepared for it. \n4. AD Pat Haden has to get this next hire right. \nThere is a reason all those big names are going to get mentioned. For one, USC has the brand and talent to lure away big names. The other reason? Pat Haden has to get this hire right to save his job -- if it's even salvagable . \nHaden has already taken plenty of heat in recent years and this will just turn up the pressure on him to hire the right guy to steady the ship and bring USC back. You can bet Haden will do everything he can to land a big name. He, as much as anyone, needs USC's football program to be a contender quickly and he'll be hoping to land a big name to do that -- and also hold together the 2016 recruiting class. \n\nSteve Sarkisian was 12-6 with USC.
