WEXLER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER David Wright, left, congratulates Daniel Murphy after Murphy hit a two-run home-run in the first inning Sunday against the Cubs in Game 2 of the NLCS. NEW YORK – A 2-0 series lead manifested itself in the span of three batters and 13 pitches in the first inning of Game 2 of the NLCS on Sunday night.\nThree hits against Jake Arrieta gave the Mets an early three-run lead, one they held onto in moving within two wins of reaching the World Series.\n“That was the game,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.\nThe Mets pounced on the potential Cy Young Award winner and received a strong outing from Noah Syndergaard to best the Cubs, 4-1. Daniel Murphy hit a two-run homer in the first to give the Mets the 3-0 lead, and Syndergaard threw 5ª innings of one-run ball.\nRelated:  Mets' players 'superheroes' to fans \nNLCS GAME 2 PHOTO GALLERY \nMurphy has the most homers by any Met in a single postseason with five.\nThe series shifts to Wrigley Field for the next three games.\n“It’s nice for an offense, when you face Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta, to jump out to a lead,” Murphy said. “With the way Noah has been and threw the ball, and the way Matt [Harvey] threw the ball, and with our pitching staff, you feel like if you can kind of strike early and settle into the game, our pitching staff gives us a chance to extend the lead.”\nThe Mets scored just two runs spanning 16 innings against Arrieta in the regular season, but they stopped that in the first. Curtis Granderson found a hole in the shift on the right side of the infield and singled on Arrieta’s fifth pitch of the game.\nDavid Wright, who was 1-for-19 entering the game, followed with a booming double to deep center on a 2-1 pitch to plate the game’s first run.\nMurphy, who set the new franchise postseason high with his fourth straight game with a homer, poked a two-run blast just inside the foul pole in right on the fourth pitch of his at-bat. Murphy had hit the second pitch foul into the second deck in right.\nThe infielder is tied for the most postseason homers in team history, joining Mets legend Mike Piazza.\nAn intentional walk of Murphy in the third helped the Mets take a 4-0 lead when Yoenis Cespedes slashed an infield RBI single off Arrieta.\n“As a teammate and hitter, very rarely do you see somebody get this hot against average pitching,” Wright said. “You throw in that it’s [Clayton] Kershaw, [Zack] Greinke, Lester, Arrieta, that’s impressive. … He’s about as locked in as I’ve seen a hitter.”\nSyndergaard turned in an electric outing against one of baseball’s top offenses. Syndergaard entered this start off a relief appearance in Game 5 of the NLDS, but felt fine afterward and earned this outing.\nThe right-hander allowed a two-out single to Kris Bryant in the first, but did not allow another hit until he surrendered a one-out single to Dexter Fowler in the sixth inning.\nGranderson helped Syndergaard in the second inning by making a leaping catch at the right-center wall to rob Chris Coghlan of a homer in a 3-0 game.\nWith two outs in the sixth, Syndergaard finally surrendered a run on a two-out RBI double to Kris Bryant that sliced the Mets’ lead to 4-1.\nHe struck out nine.\nAfter Syndergaard departed, the bullpen threw 3¤ scoreless innings, and Jeurys Familia set the Mets postseason record with his fourth save of this postseason.\nJacob deGrom takes the ball in Game 3.\n“You go out there and the offense puts up a three spot on one of the best pitchers in the game right now, kind of takes a load off my shoulders,” Syndergaard said. “I felt I was able to battle the elements. I was able to stay loose and stay warm.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:59:33.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
