The city's financial obligation to the fire fighters has fueled contentious debate between the fire fighters’ union and the mayor, who at one point faced house arrest for refusing a judge’s order to pay up.\nLate Thursday evening, the mayor’s director of communications sent the following statement:\n“The settlement with the firefighters keeps the city on a positive fiscal track, gets major reforms to the pension, and ensures that the pension fund will be there for firefighters in the future. Tomorrow, Mayor Landrieu, alongside other officials, will announce the details of the settlement.“\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
