Tech returns home to face No. 10 Kansas By Diego Gaytan 0 Kirby Crumpler \nTexas Tech outside hitter Jenna Allen spikes the ball during Tech's 3-1 win against Portland State on Sept. 18 in the United Supermarkets Arena. \nThe Texas Tech volleyball team returns home for Big 12 Conference play against the No. 10 Kansas Jayhawks at 3 p.m. today in the United Supermarkets Arena. \nFor the Red Raiders, its matchup versus Kansas marks the start of a two game home stint with its second opponent, the Texas Christian Horned Frogs, facing the team at 11 a.m. Saturday. \nIn its first two road matches in the Big 12, Tech failed to pick up a set win versus Iowa State and Baylor, dropping the team to a 12-5 overall record and 1-2 Big 12 record. \nIn the final set of its match versus Baylor, the Red Raiders came within a point to push the match to four sets with a 24-22 lead, but Baylor forced a 4-0 run to claim the third set and finish the match. \nCoach Don Flora said a strong offensive response from Tech and running an efficient serve and passing game. \n“The matches where we struggled in our offense, we’ve had to struggle and recalibrate passing,” Flora said. “Once we get our passing going, if you look at the numbers at the Baylor match, start to get our passing going in set three our offensive numbers grow.” \nSophomore middle blocker Lauren Douglass said Tech’s first full week of rest gave the Red Raiders time to reflect on its season and its Big 12 competition. \n“I think it just gave us more time to reflect on what we need to change and work on, especially after that Baylor game,” she said. “I think it allowed us to clear our minds and move forward to the next team.” \nKansas currently leads the Big 12 in all offensive categories as it ranks first in service aces, hitting percentage, assists and kills as well as opponent hitting percentage in the defensive category. \nIn its last two matches in the 2014 season, Tech won only one of its seven disputed sets versus the Jayhawks with its only set win coming at home. \nFrom past seasons, Flora said he sees the Jayhawks running a fast tempo offense with versatility and quick transitions. \n“They run some good tandem plays, meaning they’re a little creative in how they have different swing patters,” he said. “I think the things over the years about Kansas are still true, and I think we matchup better about those things now.” \nIn its seven home matchups, Tech only dropped one match to the Washington State Cougars in three sets. \nTech faces a nationally ranked undefeated Jayhawks squad which has amassed a 15-0 overall record and a 3-0 Big 12 record. \nAt home, Douglass said Tech plays energized and with confidence against its opponents. \n“We have sense of pride in our own gym,” Douglass said. “We want to show out for a home team.” ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:38:06.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
