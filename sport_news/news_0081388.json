In a memorandum submitted to the Chief Minister, council president OP Kapoor said parking, which required immediate solution, had been one of the major problems being faced by the people of the town. The council also urged the Chief Minister to expedite the construction of a bridge over the Beas river, the foundation stone of which was laid on Mahashivrati eve this year. He said the ESIC Medical College and Hospital at Ner Chowk was still non-operative and required immediate solution so that people of Lahaul, Kullu, Mandi and other parts of Kangra could avail tertiary medical care facilities. He said the Chief Minister was also urged to sanction an artificial lake on the Beas, which would mitigate the environmental degradation of Mandi town caused by the BSL project. He said the historic town of Mandi, also known as Chhoti Kashi, had the distinction of having the oldest Municipal Council in the state and it was expected that Mandi would get the Municipal Corporation status before any other town of Himachal Pradesh. Of late, Dharamsala has been upgraded to the status of corporation, but Mandi which fully deserves the status, has been left. It is the second most populous town in the state after Shimla and it has the distinction of having proper underground sewerage system for the last 20 years. The town has been covered under the Heritage Project (funded by Asian Development Bank), which will restore the heritage and ancient monuments and enhance heritage tourism in a big way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:18:12.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
