I want to get more reps, but at the same time, I want to do what's best for the team and put the right guys in and the right packages in.\" \nAfter six games for the Browns (2-4), who are currently in third place in the AFC North Division, Shelton looks at Sunday's game against the St. Louis Rams at the Edward Jones Dome as an opportunity to come of age as a defensive player in the NFL. \n\"For me, the way I think of it is really, we're halfway, so that's basically the end of a college season,\" Shelton said. \"It's basically time for me to mature and be a professional, so I'm really focusing on just taking care of my body and being ready to play the rest of the weeks the season has for us. \n\"Personally, I haven't done what I want to do yet. That's just me transitioning from college, but at the same time, it's just me trying too much. I've just got to continue to work with my guys, work with the veterans like Karlos (Dansby), work with Des (Bryant) and Randy (Starks), and John Hughes, just continue to work with those guys and improve on my work. \n\"(I'm) just not really focusing, not focusing on doing technique. My eyes are in the backfield or whatever. I just have to continue to focus.\" \nShelton has registered just 14 total tackles, including five solo stops, in his first six games in the NFL and said the transition from the University of Washington to the Browns has been harder than what he expected. However, he remains confident in the ability to be an impactful player for the Browns in the near future. \n\"I'm always going to have that faith,\" Shelton said. \"I'm always going to have that faith that I can help the Dawg Pound out, I can bring a win back for the Dawg Pound. I'm always going to have faith that I'll make it to the Super Bowl, I'll be a Pro Bowler. It just takes time. \n\"Nothing happens quickly. You always got to work for it. It's the same thing like I was in high school and college. I always had these doubters and you just have to have the faith that you're going to turn the program around, you're going to make plays that helps turn the program around, so it's just a matter of time when it happens.\" \nAnd those who play alongside Shelton on a daily basis also have faith that he can play at a high level and help improve a Browns defense that ranks near the bottom of the NFL in total yardage and rushing yards allowed. \n\"I like Danny as a player because he's hard on himself, and that's good and bad,\"defensive lineman John Hughes said. \"He's been playing good ball. At the same time, he's only a rookie, so he's going to continue to get better. It reminds me of how my mentality was my rookie year. You can never be good enough. \n\"You don't see guys his size with his athleticism and some guys, when they come in, they're very raw, but he wasn't as raw. He knew his technique, but at the same time, there's always different things you can get better at, different things you can learn. The first thing you learn when you come here is the scheme. Then, everything starts piling on after that.\" \nShelton is anxious to make those good things pile up on Sunday against a Rams team that has rushed for an average of 119 yards per game and 4.8 yards per carry. \n\"We're focusing on getting off our blocks, focusing on setting an edge, focusing on tackling and not just whiffing a tackle,\" Shelton said. \"It takes the same thing every day: commitment, consistency and pure focus. You gotta be able to do those three things, and hopefully, we can do that this week. \n\"It just comes down to committing to the team, having trust in each other, being accountable for your job. I'm going to count on Randy Starks, I'm going to count on Des, I'm going to count on Karlos to do their jobs. For me, really, it's just to focus on my job and to do what I have to do. \n\"Everybody gets frustrated. In any occupation you have, you always get frustrated when things aren't going the right way, when you're not producing and you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing. Everybody gets frustrated, but we have no time to get frustrated right now. All we have to do is just continue to focus and continue to be consistent.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LQhAzm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:19:15.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
