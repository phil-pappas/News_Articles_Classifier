Sure we have a lot of athleticism, but you need brains to pull out something like this.\" \nThe win moved Ozen (8-4) all alone into third place in District 22-5A while Lumberton (7-5) fell into a fourth-place tie with Port Neches-Groves (7-5). The Rock-A-Noos swept Baytown Lee Tuesday at home. \nOzen can clinch a playoff spot Friday with a win over PN-G in their final home match of the season. \n\"It would mean so much to be able to go to the playoff with this team,\" Cockrell said. \"I wouldn't want to go with anyone else.\" \nTempestt Vaughn , Alissa Johnson and Mercedes Perry all contributed at least six kills for the Lady Panthers, who fought back from a 2-1 set deficit for the win. Vaughn added a match-high four blocks. \n\"Give Lumberton credit, they are a great team,\" said Ozen coach Stephanie March-Smith. \"This was a battle and we were lucky to leave on top. This is a huge win for this program and the girls. They deserve to celebrate. They've worked hard for this moment. There is just still work to be done.\" \nHaley Hood and Taylor Kile led Lumberton in defeat, registering 13 and nine kills respectively. The Lady Raiders will face first-place Goose Creek Memorial Friday at home before hosting Central next Tuesday for their final regular season match. \nDThompson@BeaumontEnterprise.comTwitter.com/daveth89", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:00:55.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
