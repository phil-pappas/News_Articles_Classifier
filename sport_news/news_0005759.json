The team's leading scorer from last year, Jasmine Sina, went down with a torn ACL this fall. \nNow the Bearcats are faced with trying to replace the America East's reigning Rookie of the Year, while also trying to improve on a four-win season from last year. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nBut just because she isn't on the floor doesn't mean Sina won't be helping BU improve this year. \n\"It's a blow, but I think her being on the sideline is also going to make me better because she sees things that I can't,\" said sophomore guard Imani Watkins. \"So she's still going to be my partner in crime, just a little differently this year.\" \nWatkins was second on the team in scoring, averaging 13.5 points per game. She is expected to play more of the point guard role this year with Sina hurt. \n\"I've asked [Jasmine] to help me make our lineup this year,\" said head coach Linda Cimino. \"She's going to be an integral part of our coaching staff. Just so she's part of the program as well and she feels that connection and she's learning.\" \nAfter having surgery last month, Sina is now back to walking without a brace. According to Cimino, she's already embraced the role of helping the freshman transition to the college game. \nBoth freshman guards McKayla Hernandez and Rebecca Carmody are expected to see time right away. \n\"I mean, the freshman are working really hard and are doing a great job,\" said senior guard Kim Albrecht. \"Having Imani back is great too and we have got a good core group of guards and we've just got to stick together.\" \nBU opens the season at Michigan Nov. 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:57:57.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
