This would seem to be a favorable matchup, although Washington appears to be an improved team in coach Jay Gruden’s second year. The Redskins are coming off a bitter overtime loss to Atlanta that was decided by a pick-six thrown by QB Kirk Cousins in OT. These teams have not met since December 2011, when the Jets routed Washington on the road.\nIn the spotlight \nJets DE Sheldon Richardson. The 2013 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and 2014 Pro Bowler returns to action Sunday after serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL’s substance-abuse policy. Richardson hasn’t played since a preseason game against the Giants on Aug. 29, and he acknowledged Monday that rust could be problem, although he quickly added that he believes he can overcome it. Thus, the Jets likely will limit his snaps, but even in part-time action, Richardson has the ability to make an immediate impact.\nGame plan \nAs usual, the Jets figure to use a run-first philosophy on offense. That seems like a good idea against a Washington defense that allowed 153 yards rushing to Atlanta’s Devonta Freeman three days ago. However, the Redskins held star QB Matt Ryan in check for the most part, so it will be interesting to see if Jets RB Chris Ivory’s tough running will set up some deep throws by QB Ryan Fitzpatrick. Washington rushed for only 2.1 yards per attempt against the Falcons, so the Jets’ stout defensive front should be able to stuff the running game and put pressure on Cousins.\n— J.P.
