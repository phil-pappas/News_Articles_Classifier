(AP) - North Carolina State has dismissed running back Shadrach Thornton from the team after another round of legal troubles. \nCoach Dave Doeren announced the decision in a statement Wednesday afternoon. That came less than a day after Raleigh police arrested Thornton following an accident in which he struck a pedestrian while riding a moped on a sidewalk and then left the scene. \nAn accident report states the pedestrian needed stitches for a facial injury. \nThornton, last year's leading rusher, had recently returned from a two-game suspension for a violation of athletic department policy. It was the senior's third suspension, the first two coming after brushes with the law in 2013. \nDoeren said it was \"an unfortunate set of circumstances.\" The school says Thornton is on track to graduate in the spring.
