Yardbarker Oct 21, 2015 at 7:38p ET 0Shares \nSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Calling it a tough decision, former NBA star and current Sacramento, California, Mayor Kevin Johnson said Wednesday he will not seek a third term next year now that the capital city is heading in a positive direction. \nJohnson, a 49-year-old Democrat, told reporters at a bookstore in the neighborhood where he grew up that he's accomplished what he wanted to do as mayor by stabilizing city finances and building a $500 million arena for the Sacramento Kings basketball team. \n\"I'm very proud of what we've accomplished,\" Johnson said. \"For me, if I think about the trajectory of Sacramento, I think we're headed in the right direction. I think we have great momentum.\" \nThe decision came as a decades-old claim of sexual abuse re-emerged as a possible liability for Johnson in a re-election bid. \nLast week, ESPN cited the claim while announcing it was delaying the premiere of a documentary on Johnson's effort to keep the Kings from leaving for Seattle. \nThe sports network said it needed to re-evaluate the film after a woman identified herself as the teenager who had accused Johnson of touching her inappropriately 20 years ago. \nJohnson has denied the claim, and the Phoenix Police Department investigated but did not file charges. \nThe Sacramento Bee reported Johnson entered a settlement worth $230,000 with the girl. Johnson has not commented on the report and a message left with his spokesman wasn't immediately returned Wednesday. \nJohnson said the claim had nothing to do with his re-election decision. \n\"I would have never run if those allegations were something that concerned me,\" the mayor said. The claim also arose during his initial mayoral campaign in 2008.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:15:11.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
