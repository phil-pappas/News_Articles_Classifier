So you need spirit throughout. It's my job to keep them together and keep them moving forward.\"\nAs in the previous two seasons, Brown wants the Sixers to always play, focus on getting better and ignore the outside noise.\nMore coverage Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone!

We never really say anything about a record.\n\"We always go with attitude. We are sticking with that.\"\nThe Sixers had their share of lowlights while finish with a 19-63 record two seasons ago, including losing an NBA record-tying 26 straight games, losing back to back games by 88 total points, and 13 straight road losses.\nLast season, their record was even worse at 18-64.\nBut Brown somehow managed to keep the team together. He is determined to do the same this season.\nkpompey@phillynews.com\n@PompeyOnSixers\nphilly.com/deepsixer", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNBA_Philadelphia_76ers"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:32:55.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
