That was the result of the Fall Final at Stafford Motor Speedway Sunday as Coby took home the win, but Preece finished right behind him in second. Pitkat, who came in as the points leader, was involved in a late incident and finished 12th, but still has a chance at winning the points title. “Strap in,” Coby said of the logjam up top going into the final race. “It’s pretty neat. It’s good for the fans, good for our series.” Coby, the defending division champion, and Preece started the race at the front and Coby stayed there throughout the race. “The outside was not the place to be on the restarts. Everybody was spinning tires and cars turned sideways and knocking wheels, getting out of control,” Coby said. Preece was involved in one of those incidents. Following a restart where he pitted, Preece tried a move to the outside, but got stuck behind James Civali while Coby and Pitkat scooted underneath going through the fourth turn. When they reached the backstretch, Civali slowed up and Preece had nowhere to go but into the back side of the No. 13 car. He ended up with a flat right front tire and a nerf bar problem. He came out of the pits on lap 107 in 10th, but was put back to 14th when too many of his pit crew came over the wall to assist on repairs. Preece fought his way back to seventh place, only to have Bobby Santos blow up in front of him as the No. 44 car lost its engine. “I was very lucky that Chase (Dowling) didn’t hit me from behind and I didn’t slide in any oil,” Preece said. Pitkat had a bad restart of his own on the 129th lap when Timmy Solomito spun his tires because of the greasy conditions in the outside lane. That allowed Preece, who had worked his way further through the field, to sneak past both into second place. Pitkat went under Solomito and the two had trouble on the back stretch three laps later. “We just ran out of racing room,” Solomito said. “I was on his outside and I was up against the concrete and I couldn’t go any higher. I don’t know if it was communication with his spotter, but my left front tire was still at his right rear.” Page 2 of 3 - The two came together and Pitkat spun into the path of Ted Christopher. Pitkat was able to continue but had to pit for a flat left rear tire and his handling was altered by a broken toe on the right front. Solomito hung on to finish third in the race. The advantage going into the final race belongs to Coby as he has won all three races at Thompson this season. “Maybe a mental advantage, but not truthful,” Coby said. “Those guys are really fast there. I’m not going there thinking I have this in the bag. We have to be on our game.” Pennink wins title Rowan Pennink slipped back to eighth place on a restart on the 24th lap of the 40-lap SK Modified feature. He needed to finish no more than six positions behind Preece to capture the division championship. “I was having a little bit of trouble getting the car to shift into high gear and that one restart, I didn’t really expect to fall back like that. But I was able to battle back,” Pennink said. Eleven laps later, Pennink settled into fourth and was more than happy to stay put. It was all the SK Modified Rookie of the Year at Stafford in 2006 needed to capture his first title at Stafford. “The level of competition here and the hype that this place brings, I couldn’t be happier to have won the championship here,” Pennink said. The driver from Huntingdon Valley, Pa. even ditched his Whelen Modified Tour ride Sunday to concentrate on the SK Modified race. “We took the race off to make sure we had the SK running perfect and made sure that we didn’t miss anything. We didn’t want the Tour distracting us. This is what we wanted,” Pennink said. While Pennink took home the season title, Eric Berndt was best overall, winning his second straight race. “(I) have the bragging rights, (I) won the last race and it’s a great way to end the year,” Berndt said. He had to hold off Ted Christopher on the final four laps to do so. Christopher was on a mission of his own as the Plainville driver was trying to keep his 29-year streak of winning at least one race at Stafford alive. “I told everybody that I pitied the guy leading when Ted got to second, so happens that it was me,” Berndt said with a laugh. “No cautions came out to close the field up, because it definitely would have been a dogfight. Teddy was hungry, hungrier than anyone in the pit area. I’m glad I didn’t see a caution.” Page 3 of 3 - Late Models Michael Bennett had already captured the season championship and added an exclamation point to the season with a victory in the final 30-lap feature of the season. “This race is pretty cool to win,” Bennett said in Victory Lane. “It’s been awhile since we won a Fall Final.” And the win came on his birthday. Right behind Bennett was Tom Fearn. It was an unusual place for Fearn to be since he had won 11 Late Model features this season. “We had a great year. I guess Michael had a little better year, congratulations to him,” Fearn said. “We have a good car, it’s in one piece and we will come back here next year as strong as we finished this year.” By Marc Allard The Bulletin The Bulletin By Marc Allard The Bulletin Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 8:27 PM Updated at 8:28 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:54:27.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
