Romanak signaled to his players where to serve and Lakeland, the No. 3 seed making its first semifinal visit since winning in 2010, was knocked off balance. \n“Serving really helps us out, because a lot of girls have tough float serves, and also we’re smart servers,” said senior libero Jamie Marchioni, who had a match-high 10 digs and was one of six Mustangs to contribute at least one ace. \nJunior Melanie Cuco, sophomore Kristen Kakascik and junior Christie Louer (team-high six kills) also served well, which helped Clifton (18-4) gain confidence and limit miscues. \n“We did a very good job minimizing mistakes – not that we didn’t make any – but we made very few of them,” said Romanak, whose team seeks a record 13th Passaic title and first since 2007. “And were able to rebound from them.” \nLakeland (12-7) played its best midway through the second set, forging a 6-1 run to pull within 21-18. During the spurt, senior Morgan Burke contributed three of her team-high six kills, as well as a block. \n“I’m proud of the way they came back in the second set, because it was a big deal for us to make the semis,” Lakeland coach Jim Phillips said. “They got the home crowd involved, so for them I was glad they felt the juice from that energy, and they deserve that.” \nWayne Valley (17-4) demonstrated why it is the tournament favorite. The Indians pulled away midway through each set and produced 29 kills, with All-Passaic senior Olivia Pantale registering 14. All facets were solid, with All-Passaic senior libero Olivia Lozy, contributing 12 digs. \n“We asked the kids to come out with energy and play hard, and that’s what they did tonight,” said Wayne Valley coach Jason Carcich, whose team seeks a fifth Passaic title and first since 2009. \n“They played hard, they stayed with them for the first half of the game, and then they kind of got down on themselves,” said DePaul coach Michelle Leeder. “But at this point, they need to dig deep and pull it out, and we just didn’t do that today.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:03:51.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
