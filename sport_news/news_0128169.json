Only 20 farmers have filled the form to apprise the government agency about their choice of payment. These feedback forms have been sent by Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board (HSAMB) to the market committees. The state government decided to give an option to farmers to select the mode of getting payment. The farmers can either get it directly from the government or can stick to the traditional system and get it through commission agents. All farmers who have submitted their forms have chosen the option of getting payment through commission agents. In the form, two options have been mentioned; in the first option they have been asked — Do you want the payment of your agriculture products such as wheat, paddy, bajra etc. directly in your bank accounts through government agencies? or Do you want to get payment through commission agents, like earlier? Besides, the farmers have been asked to mention their name, bank account number, details about their produce, contact number, house address and village name. Gaurav Arya, secretary of Thanesar grain market, said: “The forms were received on September 30. Once the farmers submit their forms back, they will be sent to Chief Administrator of HSAMB. The board will apprise the government about the farmers’ preferences after evaluating these forms.” District Marketing Enforcement Officer Rajeev Chaudhary said: “As per information provided by the market secretaries, thousands of forms have been distributed among farmers. However, the response has been lukewarm. Only a few farmers have apprised about their choice at the Thanesar grain market, while no farmer has submitted his form at Pipli, Pehowa, Shahabad, Ismailabad and Ladwa grain markets.” He said: “The secretaries have been asked not only to circulate the forms, but also get them filled too. Besides, they have been asked to appoint staff members who will approach the farmers in the markets and get these forms filled.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:18:50.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
