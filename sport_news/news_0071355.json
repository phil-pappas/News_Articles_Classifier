The Serbian brushed aside the challenge of a befuddled Tsonga 6-1 6-4 to claim his third Shanghai Masters and ninth title of a standout year that has left him being spoken of among the sport’s all-time greats. Djokovic won three Grand Slams this year, was runner-up at the French Open and since suffering a surprise quarterfinal loss to Ivo Karlovic in Qatar in January has made the final of all the 13 events he has played. The 30-year-old Tsonga had shown his serving prowess in taking out Rafa Nadal in three tight sets in the semifinals on Saturday but against the imperious returning skills of Djokovic he had no answers. “Today the key was to get as many serves back into play to Jo because he has one of the biggest serves in the game,” Djokovic said. It was a second straight tournament Djokovic had won without dropping a set after he landed his sixth China Open title in Beijing last week. The Serb now boasts a 38-1 win loss record on the Chinese hardcourts. The victory was Djokovic’s 57th ATP Tour title, moving him within two of Nadal’s mark of 27 Masters Series crowns, and took his prize money for the year past a record $16 million. Jankovic outlasts Kerber to claim Hong Kong title Hong Kong: Jelena Jankovic made it a Serbian win double in Asia on Sunday as she fought back from a set down to beat Germany’s Angelique Kerber to take the Hong Kong Open title. The former world No. 1 triumphed 3-6 7-6(4) 6-1 to claim her 15th WTA title and second of the year. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:06:21.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
