And I am certain that no other member of the bidding committee did it either.\" \nThe 70-year-old Beckenbauer was responding to Friday's report by German newsweekly Der Spiegel which alleged a slush fund of 10.3 million Swiss francs (about $6 million at that time) was set up to buy the votes of four Asian representatives on FIFA's 24-member executive committee. \nGerman football federation (DFB) president Wolfgang Niersbach rejected the allegations Saturday.
