(Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar) \nA little light housecleaning for The Morning Man, before entering the Bucco Bunker shortly before 8 this evening. My father-in-law wanted to watch the game with me; my wife knows better. I will be curled up fetally , except when I'm running around the room like a living four-letter word. Fandom isn't pretty. If the Arrietas beat my Club , I will cry like a child . But only for a couple weeks. \nNow, then. . . \nI'M NOT ONE TO TAKE ON MY BRETHREN IN THE MEDIA because I know how hard it is to do this stuff consistently well and I don't need the aggravation. It's hard enough keeping peace with those I write and talk about; no need to add to that list. \nHowevuh. . . \nMy pal Lance opened his show Tuesday night suggesting the Reds had no viable option other than keeping BPrice. Lance blamed 64-98 entirely on Jock . He also said no ballclub uses a new manager as a selling point/marketing weapon. Let's discuss. \nRe marketing: What club has ever used a new manager as a marketing tool? \nWhat club hasn't? \nDid the Cubs not promote Joe Maddon last winter? \nWhen Pete Rose returned here as player/manager, did fans yawn? I seem to recall Phil Donahue bringing his show to Cincinnati for the blessed event. \nWhen Pete was ousted and replaced by Lou, did the Reds not use Piniella to help sell tickets? He was on the front of the media guide. \nBob Castellini wanted a big-name manager when he hired Dusty Baker , even as insiders believed Pete Mackanin deserved a shot. Do you think the Reds didn't promote Dusty Baker's hiring? \nOzzie Guillen in Miami was a disaster; the notion he would sell tickets to the Latin population was entirely real. And so on. So, yeah, lots of teams hire managers with marketing in mind. \nRe blame : Sure, Walt & Co. have had below-average results when it has come to re-stocking the shelves. They've done OK (emphasis on OK, unless you know Lamb, Reed, Finnegan etc. are going to be terrific, in which case I would direct you to the sports books in Vegas) in acquiring pitching. There are no bats. If the Reds situation were a movie, we could call it Waiting On Winker. \nBut . . . On the morning of Aug. 1, the Reds were 46-55 . They went 18-43 the rest of the way. That's .295 baseball. Even bad teams win more than that. A lot more, in fact. \nWinning 40 percent of the time is bad, yeah? \nOnly the Reds and Phillies finished under .400. The Red Sox (.481) and Detroit (.460) finished last, despite having 14 and 10 more wins than the Reds, respectively. So, nobody wins just 29 percent of the time, no matter how bad they are. The Reds shouldn't have, either.

The Reds fell to the Cubs, 5-3, in the final home game of the season. (Photo: The Enquirer/Sam Greene) \nAs for the talent : As lacking as it was after the deadline, does anyone think it was 18-43 lacking? The core of the everyday 8 played every day . Votto, Bruce, Frazier and DDBP each had well over 600 PAs. Suarez played every day after Cozart got hurt. Byrd played every day until he was traded. Hamilton was in there all the time until he got hurt. The only missing piece was Mesoraco. \nWe like to believe that the post-deadline Club was a collection of Balesters, Bourgeois and Lambs. It wasn't. \nThe best of the bullpen – Chappy, Hoover and Badenhop -- was healthy all year. \nHere's the point: Yes, Price was working with half a loaf. And yes, he did less than expected with it. \nTo blame only the GM for .295 is simply wrong. \nAs I wrote in This Space and in the TM the other day, I'm glad Price is returning. But it's a selfish glad. We work well together. He has been helpful and pleasant. But I'm not a Reds fan. \nAs a Reds fan, it's fair to be angry , and to wonder why patience was exercised in this situation, and not with Baker, who was fired coming off a playoff appearance. It's fair to ask how the players have responded to Price's leadership, and to demand some accountability for 18-43/64-98. \nJust to dismiss it by saying the roster was bereft is ducking responsibility. And it's wrong. \nAre we good with that? \nMEDIA MENTION NO. 2 . . . Radio Mo ran a cut of Colin Cowherd talking about Andy Dalton yesterday. Cowherd said, essentially, that Dalton remains highly average and is fortunate to have good players around him. \nWell. \nThought the First: Cowherd is the same guy who, shortly before the 2012 ASG said he didn't know who Joey Votto was. Sounds like the name of my pool boy, Cowherd allowed. Votto was the NL MVP that year. Pool boy makes big splash! \nThought the Second: Cowherd fashions himself a big-timer. The thought of having to lower himself to recognize a jock or a team from li'l ol' Cincinnati is too much for him to handle. If you don't play in LA or on the East Coast, you escape Colin's field of vision. \nThought the Third: I would bet Cowherd hasn't watched more than a few Bengals snaps this year, and those were very likely from Sports Center or Red Zone. I know he hasn't been in town or talked to a soul about Dalton. Cowherd would need a Sherpa guide to find Cincinnati. \nIt is the rare QB who wins a lot without lots of help . Brady has been one, and no one is saying Dalton is Brady. Elway didn't win a Big Bowl until Terrell Davis showed up. So to say that Dalton is only doing well because he has lots of help seems kinda obvious, doesn't it? \nCowherd, too, knows that Dalton's numbers will dive as the season progresses. Could be right. But unlike Colin, the rest of us aren't in the fortune-telling business. If I were as sure about everything as Cowherd is, I'd be at the Bellagio, winning piles of money. \nMaybe Dalton falters. Those who actually watch the games and talk to people would probably be surprised by that. Those who hold a microphone in LA would not. Assess the credibility of each, and make your choice. Cincinnati Bengal Giovani Bernard on Beyond the Stripes presented by JosephAuto.com.com from the Moerlein Lager House with Paul Daugherty, Paul Dehner Jr, Jim Owczarski and Lindsay patterson. The Enquirer/Glenn Hartong \nGIOVANI GOVAN BERNARD was terrific last night, on Beyond The Stripes. Candid, open, smart, patient with all the goofy questions and things we asked him to do. \nI'm continually amazed at how interesting and engaging the players are that we have on the show. When you get them out of the locker room cave and into the public lights, they lose some of their wariness . They let down their guard and become damned near the guy next door. Is 'True Life: Gio' the next Lifetime movie? \nI got Gio to talk again about his occasionally rough childhood in south Florida, about his Haitian immigrant parents, about how he honors his late mother, and how his life has informed the way he lives now. Plus, he admitted he's cheap, and that one of his favorite Xmas presents was gift cards for Red Robin. \nWe had a full house at Moerlein last night. If you want to know these guys more than what they think about being 4-0, if you want insight beyond stats and flattery, check out the podcasts and/or come down to the lager house next Tuesday. Guest is Adam Jones, who has been on twice already and is astounding. Cincinnati Bengals running back Giovani Bernard is on the Hot Seat with The Enquirer's Paul Daugherty on Beyond the Stripes presented by JosephAuto.com from The Moerlein Lager House. The Enquirer/Glenn Hartong \nINSTANT WILD CARD ANALYSIS … MPWS win if they can scratch out a run or two early, before Arrieta settles in. The Pirates best chance will be keeping their crazy crowd fully engaged and taking advantage of what could be a Cubs team that's a little on edge . If Chicago gets up early, game over. \nIF YOU ONLY READ ONE THING . . . make it this piece on SI.com about the family of ESPN's Ed Werder. And we think we have problems. \nAnd finally. . . \nLOVE FOR HUE from P. King: \nCOACH OF THE WEEK \nHue Jackson, offensive coordinator, Cincinnati. I love the symmetry Jackson has created with the Bengals offense. On Sunday, Cincinnati ran 50 plays (26 rushing plays, 24 passing) and rolled up 445 total yards, for a gaudy 8.9-yard average gain per play. He's finding a way to feature two very good backs, Gio Bernard and Jeremy Hill, who combined for four rushing touchdowns against the Chiefs. And he's keeping Andy Dalton productive and clean. For the game, Dalton was not sacked by the usually ransacking Chiefs rush, and he was hit on only two of his 24 pass-drops. There's a reason Cincinnati is 4-0, and it's because of the balance and efficiency on both sides of the ball. It's a tribute to Jackson that he's able to keep a lot of talented players seemingly happy—and very productive . \nTUNE O' THE DAY . A little Fleetwood Mac in my head this AM.
