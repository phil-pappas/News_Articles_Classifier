And year after maddening year, the Green Bay Packers find themselves on a quest for answers that have been extremely elusive. \nSince Dom Capers arrived as Green Bay's defensive coordinator in 2009, high-level quarterbacks have enjoyed record-setting days against his defense. \nSunday afternoon was no different, as San Diego's Philip Rivers dissected the Packers' secondary in a breathtaking performance. Rivers set career highs for passing yards (503), completions (43) and passing attempts (65). \nThe Packers did laugh last, though, stiffening at critical times and making just enough plays to escape with a 27-20 win. \n\"I will say, he is elite,\" Packers cornerback Casey Hayward said of Rivers. \"You can watch it on film and see it and say it, but until you actually face it, it's like, 'Wow.' He really impressed me.\" \nOver the last seven seasons, the Packers have been saying 'Wow' a lot after seeing Pro Bowl quarterbacks. \nBen Roethlisberger threw for 503 yards and three touchdowns during Pittsburgh's 37-36 win over the Packers in 2009. Arizona's Kurt Warner went 29 of 33, threw for five touchdowns and 379 yards during a playoff win over Green Bay that same year. \nIn 2011, New Orleans' Drew Brees (419 yards, three TDs), Rivers (385 yards, four TDs) and Detroit's Matthew Stafford (520 yards, five TDs) all had huge regular-season games against Green Bay. The New York Giants' Eli Manning threw for 677 yards and six touchdowns in two games vs. the Packers that year, including a stunning playoff upset in Lambeau Field. \nSan Francisco's Colin Kaepernick torched the Packers with 444 total yards in the 2012 playoffs. A handful of quarterbacks had big days against Green Bay's 2013 defense that allowed 26.8 points per game, its most since 1983. \nAnd in 2014, Atlanta's Matt Ryan (375 yards, four TDs) had one of the better games of his career. \nIn today's pass-happy NFL, quarterbacks are putting up numbers like never before. What has to worry the Packers, though, is many of the elite quarterbacks are having career days against them. \nRivers was the latest to do so, compiling some of the finest numbers of his brilliant 12-year career. \n\"They had a lot of weapons,\" Packers safety Micah Hyde said. \"They had weapons. Simple as that. \n\"That's a good offense. They moved the ball well. But we got the 'W.' That's all that matters.\" \nThe Packers tried everything against Rivers. They unveiled a package with seven defensive backs. They rushed three and dropped eight. Other times Capers brought the house. \nBut Rivers, magnificent wideout Keenan Allen (14 catches before suffering a hip flexor) and the Chargers were typically a step ahead. \n\"We tried a whole bunch of stuff,\" Hayward said. \"Some of it worked and he'd diagnose it and then we'd have to go to something else. That's what the great quarterbacks do. But to our defense, we found a way. \n\"They got 20 points. We got a couple fourth-down stops. Held them to some field goals and that's what you do as a defense, especially with a great offense like that. You try to control them and keep them in field goals and not get seven points. You want to give them three points because you know they're going to move the ball.\" \nSan Diego finished with a whopping 548 net yards and held the ball for 38 minutes. Rivers threw for two touchdowns, zero interceptions and had a 99.7 quarterback rating. \nAnd while the Packers bent between the 20-yard lines, they rarely broke. \nRivers engineered first-half drives of 62, 72 and 88 yards. But those three long marches led to just one touchdown and 10 total points as Green Bay's defense hardened in the red zone. \nRivers led the Chargers on a 79-yard touchdown drive early in the second half to pull even, 17-17. But despite putting on an aerial show, the Chargers managed just one field goal the rest of the way. \nOf San Diego's six trips inside Green Bay's red zone, the Chargers managed just two touchdowns, two field goals and twice went away empty. \n\"If you have a chance to study their offense, he's so accurate with the football and the at-the-line offense and the command of recognizing the defense and so forth, you've got to give him a ton of credit there,\" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \"But I said this during the week, I was real impressed with their passing game, his ability to throw guys on target and their ability to come out of routes. \n\"They did a good job of throwing balls and completing them away from our leverage and they beat our leverage sometimes. It was a competitive match, but we kept them out of the end zone. That's what was most important. When you get in games like that, where you're giving up a lot of yards, at the end of day it's about field goals vs. touchdowns and that was obviously a big part of this game.\" \nRivers had one final chance to force overtime, driving his team from its own 20 to the Green Bay 3 in the final minute. \nOn first down, Clay Matthews stuffed running back Danny Woodhead for one yard at the 2. On second down, Rivers overshot tight end Antonio Gates when he had Woodhead available in the right flat for a probable touchdown. \nWoodhead lost a yard on third down when Datone Jones made arguably the biggest tackle of his Green Bay career. Then, on fourth down, Rivers went to Woodhead in the right flat, but rookie cornerback Damarious Randall made a perfect break on the ball and knocked it away. \n\"You have to laugh to keep from crying,\" Rivers said. \"And as good as we played, in a lot of ways, we left plays out there that we normally make. We should've scored forty, we should've. And that's what's frustrating.\" \nGreen Bay's remaining schedule isn't littered with Pro Bowl quarterbacks. \nDenver's Peyton Manning is up next, but he hasn't played like his old self. Dallas' Tony Romo should be back when the Packers and Cowboys meet in December and Arizona's Carson Palmer is a threat. \nThe playoffs will pose their own set of problems. \nWhile the Packers left Sunday's game thrilled about the win, they know they must also find a way to slow down red-hot quarterbacks that have tortured them since 2009. \n\"You never want to give up 503 (passing) yards,\" Hayward said. \"That's too many. But the bottom line is still 20 points and that's not too bad against that quarterback and that offense. \n\"We've got a lot to work on, but we also have a lot going for us.\" \nThis story appeared in Packer Plus Magazine.
