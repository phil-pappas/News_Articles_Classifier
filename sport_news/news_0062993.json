Photo: Getty Images\nAustralian sports fans are one step closer to watching the NFL's biggest stars perform Down Under, with team owners approving proposals to stage more international fixtures until 2025.\nLondon's Wembley Stadium holds three encounters a year and there are tentative plans for a game to be played in Mexico in 2016.\nThe success of Jarryd Hayne in making the transition from the NRL to the San Francisco 49ers' 53-man roster has raised interest in American football significantly in Australia.\nAnd with the league looking at moving the end-of-season Pro Bowl fixture to international sites by early 2018, Australia is now in the mix with South Africa and Asia.\nAdvertisement \"You could realistically look at taking that (Pro Bowl fixture) almost anywhere in the world where it's appealing,\" said NFL vice-president/international Mark Waller.\n\"It's hard to imagine taking a regular-season game to Australia or Asia or the far east because how would you make the logistics work and then be competitive?\n\"But the great thing about the Pro Bowl is that it's a celebration of the end of the season, so we are much more open to where in the world would it be fantastic for players to go and celebrate the end of the season.\n\"Rio would be great. South Africa would be great. Australia would be great. It's a very different animal.\"\nCommissioner Roger Goodell said the decision by clubs to approve international fixtures marked an important step in their long-term international growth.\n\"We think it's time to expand our international series to other countries and respond to the growing interest in our game not only in the UK, but elsewhere around the world,\" said Goodell.\nMexico, where one regular-season game was played in 2005 and drew a record attendance of 103,467, is a front-runner for next year.\n\"That's our biggest fan base, our most vibrant market,\" said Waller. \"It would be a logical place to start.\"\nEarlier this year the NFL agreed with English Premier League club Tottenham to play at least two games a season at its new stadium in north London, which is scheduled to open in 2018.\nAP/AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:59:20.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
