Ideally he should have had a breather before Watford, but realistically the real breather he should have had was against Andorra.\" \nWenger also said that he asked England coach Roy Hodgson to take a cautious approach to Theo Walcott playing against Lithuania in England's final qualifier on an artificial pitch in Vilnius. \nWalcott was on the bench and did not come on. \n\"We asked him to be cautious and to speak to Theo to see how he felt because the match was on an artificial pitch,\" Wenger said. \n\"He has come back from a long-term injury and basically nobody wants to play on an artificial pitch.\" \nWalcott has either started or come on as a substitute in 13 of Arsenal's 14 matches this season and is expected to lead the attack again against Everton on Saturday. \n(Reporting by Mike Collett , editing by Ed Osmond) \nOur top news photography from this week.
