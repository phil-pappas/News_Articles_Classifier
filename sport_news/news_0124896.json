Coming into the Mid-American Conference contest, head coach Pete Lembo said he wanted to maintain a balanced offense. \n“(Neal’s) got a bright future,” he said in his weekly press conference. “We’ve just got to be careful we don’t ask him to do too much.” \nAgainst the Huskies, Neal was asked to do a whole lot. And he delivered. Neal finished the game with four touchdowns and a Ball State freshman record-393 yards on 31 of 51 passing. \nBut Neal's performance wasn't enough. Northern Illinois won 59-41. \nThe Huskies just also happened to get in rhythm after that surreal first quarter in which both teams combined for three points. The squads combined for 45 in the second quarter. \nOne of Neal’s few mistakes on the day was an interception in his own red zone that set up Northern Illinois for a quick, momentum-shifting touchdown just before halftime. Beyond that, Northern Illinois completely dominated in the trenches. \nThe Huskies rushed for 273 yards on 59 attempts — good for 4.6 yards per rush. Much like it was last week against Toledo, Ball State’s defense was pretty helpless against the ground game. Rushers pushed through to the second and third levels all day, but especially late as Northern Illinois started to run the clock down. \nBall State managed just 110 rushing yards on 35 attempts. That isn’t good, considering the production the Cardinals achieved early in the year against the likes of Northwestern and Texas A&M. \nThat said, Neal was a definite bright spot. He had a career day across the board. When Ball State couldn’t run it, he was able to drop back and make the plays necessary to keep things close. Two passes stood out on the day. \nNear the end of the game, Neal hit redshirt junior Cywettnie Brown in stride for a 53-yard touchdown, the longest play of the season for Ball State. Earlier in the day he hit senior KeVonn Mabon in stride for a 49-yard touchdown. \nSenior receiver Jordan Williams led all receivers with 9 receptions for 108 yards. Mabon added another 99 yards and a touchdown on six receptions. Eight Ball State players made a catch Saturday. \nAnother noteworthy aspect of Ball State’s offensive showing was the tempo. Lembo said after the loss to Toledo that he liked how Neal looked in the hurry-up offense and the two-minute drill. He looked comfortable in the pocket again this week, mostly making good decisions. \nHe had the interception, and he took a needless sack when he should have thrown it away. But he also made eye-opening plays, and he showed maturity in the pocket. It was a promising day for the quarterback that’s sure to see more of Northern Illinois down the road. \nFor now though, Neal just wasn’t enough. The Bronze Stalk trophy, which goes to the winner of this rivalry game, stays in DeKalb, Illinois, where it’s been since 2009. \nFollow Ball State sports reporter Dakota Crawford on Twitter @DakotaCrawford_ . 24 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1LoxrF0 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:31:36.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
