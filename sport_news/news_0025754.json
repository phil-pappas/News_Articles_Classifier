Reynolds was slow to get up and walked off on his own. Trainers looked at his leg for several minutes before Reynolds jogged slowly to the locker room. Tago Smith replaced him the next series and Navy scored two touchdowns to tie the score. \nReynolds has 73 career rushing touchdowns, four shy of the NCAA record set by Wisconsin's Montee Ball He had a 51-yard run on Navy's first play to set up the first touchdown by the Midshipmen. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:27:16.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
