Back | Next THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Royals designated hitter Kendrys Morales reacts after hitting a three-run home run during the eighth inning of Game 5 of the AL Division Series against the Houston Astros on Wednesday in Kansas City, Mo. By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — Johnny Cueto hadn’t really pitched like an ace as a member of the Kansas City Royals. And the Royals were prepared to not treat him as one Wednesday night. \nWith their season on the line against the Houston Astros in Game 5 of the American League Division Series, Royals manager Ned Yost made strategic plans with his bullpen for every inning if Cueto got in trouble. But Yost never left the dugout. There was no need. \nIn front of an electric crowd of 40,566 at Kauffman Stadium, Cueto turned in his finest performance as a Royal, delivering eight innings of two-run ball in a 7-2 come-from-behind victory that sends the Royals into the ALCS for the second year in a row. The Royals will play the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 on Friday at Kauffman Stadium in a rematch of the 1985 ALCS. \nWhen the Royals traded for Cueto (1-0) in late July, they believed he was the missing piece in the rotation. His up-and-down regular season as a Royal left many to wonder about his prospects in the postseason. But Cueto quieted doubters by striking out eight and walking none, while earning his first career postseason win. \n“I woke up today on the right foot,” Cueto said through an interpreter. “As soon as I woke up, I felt something magical that this was Game 5 and I had to show up for everybody, for my team and the fans.” \nBoth times Cueto took the mound in the ALDS, the Royals were victorious. In his Game 2 start, Cueto struggled early before finishing strong. In Game 5, Cueto was strong from the start. He gave up just two hits, both coming in the second inning that led to a quick 2-0 deficit in the span of two pitches. \nWith two outs, Evan Gattis reached on an infield hit and Luis Valbuena hammered Cueto’s next pitch 392 feet over the wall in right field. Cueto possibly could have gotten out of the inning unscathed as he got Gattis to hit a grounder to deep third that was nearly a putout. \nMike Moustakas fielded and fired, but the throw pulled Eric Hosmer off the bag at first. Hosmer tried to tag Gattis as he ran by, but the ball popped out of his glove. Valbuena then turned on a 94 mph heater on Cueto’s next delivery. But that was all the Astros could manage against Cueto, who will be a free agent at the end of the year. \nPrior to Wednesday’s start, many believed Cueto would have to pay the price in free agency for his late-season struggles. But Cueto might have earned some of that green back with his dominating performance. \n“This was his night,” Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. “He had a good fastball tonight. Got it and crept into the 90s, and the good version of Johnny Cueto is really tough.” \nCueto also received plenty of help from his defense as Alex Gordon made a sliding catch in foul territory in the sixth and Ben Zobrist made a leaping catch in the seventh. \n“When you pitch a great ballgame like that it really inspires your defense to pick up the pitcher any way he can,” Gordon said. “That’s great pitching and great defense and that was good to see tonight.” \nWith the Astros leading 2-1 in the fifth, the baggage from Game 4 finally made it to Kansas City as the Royals rallied against Houston starter Collin McHugh, the winner in Game 1. Alex Rios’ double down the left-field line against Mike Fiers (1-1), who earlier in the season threw a no-hitter, scored Salvador Perez and Gordon to give the Royals the lead, sending the sellout crowd into a roar. \n“This team isn’t afraid to play with its back behind the wall,” Yost said. “They’ve got a lot of confidence in themselves, and we fell behind 2-0 early, and McHugh’s good. But I just kept telling myself to have patience and that these guys were going to find a way to put some runs on the board.” \nKansas City added another run as Rios later scored from third on a sac fly from Zobrist. And at that point, it was really just a matter of time before the celebration began, though Kendrys Morales gave the fans an early treat with a three-run homer in the eighth — his third of the postseason — off Dallas Keuchel. \nCloser Wade Davis breezed through the ninth, capping another KC comeback that was no doubt fueled in part by the rally in Game 4. \n“There’s no doubt that Game 4 was an inspiration to me,” Cueto said. “To see Moose screaming at everybody in the dugout like we’re not done yet, all I kept thinking about was if we came back to win this game, I’ll take care of business in Game 5.” \nSo now the Royals’ historic season will continue. And they will get a chance to defend their American League crown, thanks to Cueto, who is seemingly armed for more. \n“Thank God I was able to pitch the game I pitched,” Cueto said. “There’s no doubt that I knew there was some talk out there about what was wrong with Johnny Cueto. But today was the game I was going to show everybody what I’m all about in big games. And that’s what I did.” \nNOTES \n■ Lorenzo Cain’s single in the fourth inning extended his postseason hitting streak to nine games, dating back to Game 4 of last year’s World Series. \n■ The first pitch was at 7:08 p.m. with a temperature of 63 degrees and an east/northeast wind at 2 mph. \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:41:38.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
