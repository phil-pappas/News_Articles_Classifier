Punter Ryan Quigley had been added to the team's injury list as questionable with an injured right shin, and New York needed someone for the game Sunday against the New England Patriots.

Quigley has been the Jets' punter since 2013, and is averaging 42.4 yards per kick this season with a 32.5 net average. \nWeatherford played for the Jets in 2009 and 2010, helping them to consecutive AFC championship games. He spent the past four seasons as a fan favourite with the Giants, and was part of the Super Bowl-winning team that beat the Patriots in February 2012. \nHe was released by the Giants before this season and has not played since. The 32-year-old Weatherford has averaged 44.5 yards per punt, with a 37.8 net average in his career that has included stops with New Orleans, Kansas City and Jacksonville. \nWeatherford has kept busy while not playing, frequently appearing on New York-area radio and TV sports shows as a guest or co-host. He was on 98.7 ESPN New York on Saturday with co-host Dave Rothenberg when Jets pro personnel scout Greg Nejmeh called him about the opportunity during a commercial break. \nHe told Nejmeh he'd take the job -- but then had to rush off the phone as the radio show went live again. He announced he would be signing with a team, but couldn't reveal at the time where he was heading.
