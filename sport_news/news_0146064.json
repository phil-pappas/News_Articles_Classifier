That’s the amount of time that stood between a gritty hard fought road victory and another painful curse-ridden loss. ESPN’s Sports Science analyzed the pivotal play from the Lions 13-10 loss to the Seahawks on Monday night and determined that Calvin Johnson was a tenth of a second away from breaking the plane of the goal line and scoring the go-ahead touchdown. Instead, Kam Chancellor punched the ball loose and K.J. Wright slapped the ball out of the back of the end zone. You may have read something about it.\nThe play overshadows some odd play calling by coach Jim Caldwell and offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi. It lessens the anger that should be directed at the fact the Lions were forced to call a time out coming out of a Seattle time out. And it obscures the fact that Matthew Stafford did exactly what we’ve always asked him to do. Go on the road. Put the team on your back. Win the game.\nA tenth of an inch and we’re talking about Stafford overcoming adversity and keeping the Lions season alive. Instead, the season is over and Stafford is the problem. A tenth of an inch. I’m picturing Al Pacino’s speech in “Any Given Sunday.”\nStafford had a pretty lousy night. Heading into the Lions final offensive drive, he was 18-for-29 for 130 yards. The offense accounted for just three points. But when the game hung in the balance and the Lions took over at their own nine-yard line, Stafford was at his best. He drove the team down the field, going 6-for-6 for 73 yards. He hit Johnson cutting across the middle for a first down and what could have been a touchdown. And…and…and…\nThe Lions lost.\nThe non-call was awful. The Lions were jobbed. Yet when all is settled, it's simply another loss for Stafford against a winning team in a visiting stadium. Not that you need reminding, but his record in those circumstances is 0-18, which is alarming at best and dreadful at worst. Most quarterbacks probably have losing records on the road in hostile environments. That’s the way football works. But those quarterbacks also have playoff wins, big road wins and the general approval of their fan bases. Stafford has none of those.\nHe probably thinks he gets a raw deal here. We know people close to him feel that way given some tweets over the years. But I think the treatment is fair for the most part.\nWhen you’re drafted in the first round - No. 1 overall - and paid more than $80 million over the length of your contracts, there are going to be expectations. The best of the best get dissected. Stafford is no exception. The difference is the best of the best have won over their fans with win after win and big play after big play. Stafford has some of those, but not nearly enough. His record as a starting quarterback is 35-46. There are dozens of reasons for that, including the fact he was drafted onto an 0-16 team, has had bad-to-mediocre line play and never had a decent, consistent running game. He battled through injuries in his first two years in the league and has been as durable as any quarterback in the game since 2011. He has plenty of touchdowns. He has plenty of interceptions.\nMost of the Lions fans have given up on Stafford. It’s nothing against him. It’s just when you watch a guy play 81 games, you start to get a sense of whether he has ‘it’ or he doesn’t. It’s clear Stafford doesn’t have ‘it’. And if you need me to define ‘it’ then you’ve never watched sports before.\nStill, his defenders argue he’s too easy of a scapegoat. That given the right system or the right supporting parts, he can win big in this league. We had plenty of callers on Tuesday morning defend Stafford saying he did everything to win the game on that final drive Monday night, but it was Johnson’s fumble that ruined the game. In other words, it was Johnson’s big mistake and not Stafford’s that was the Lions ultimate undoing.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nSeidel: Lions breed culture of defeat\nThat’s true. But if you’re going to blame Johnson for the teams undoing on Monday then you also have to give Johnson full credit for Stafford’s 5000+ yard, 41-touchdown season in 2011. There were plenty of times where Stafford threw it up for Johnson in double and triple coverage and Johnson somehow came down with the football. You can’t have it both ways.\nThe thinking is this – Stafford is not the best quarterback and he’s not the worst. I agree. But in a salary cap driven league, he has to be better. Ultimately, that’s why fans in Detroit treat him so harshly (notice I didn’t say unfairly).\nAs the Lions broke the huddle and went to the line of scrimmage Monday night trailing the Seahawks, Jon Gruden said something along the lines of, “You’re looking at a huge chunk of the Lions payroll right there in Stafford and Johnson. They need to make a play.”\nThat sums it up perfectly. Lion fans aren’t demanding Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers. But they’re certainly expecting better than 254.3 yards per game passing, five touchdowns, five interceptions and zero wins. Is that all on Stafford? Of course not. But this is the NFL. Quarterbacks take the bulk of the credit when things go well (Brady, Rodgers) and the bulk of the blame when they don’t (Jay Cutler, Colin Kaepernick).\nThere’s been a pretty big rumbling in Detroit since the loss Monday night. Some of the fan anger is directed at the Lions for not yelling and screaming about the injustice of what happened to them in the game. Caldwell took that question on Wednesday and said as long as the Lions win games, none of the other stuff will matter.\nI’m not sure truer words have ever been spoken. You can say those words about the team and about their quarterback. If Stafford doesn’t like the treatment, there are two simple solutions: Either stop playing the position, or play it better.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nGoing batty: The worst & weirdest Lions losses since 2000\nDownload our new Lions Xtra app on Apple and Android !", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e94732a3d36edd54a98d2318bfef02ce1c2b2045/c=1412-0-4706-3294/local/-/media/2015/10/06/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635797705835847978-GTY-491476950.jpg", "http://twitter.com/jamiesamuelsen/", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gannett.dolly.Lions&hl=en", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/49b5faf6af280f7893785ceacd79a05866f33de4/c=0-0-1249-706&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/06/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635797439606564573-1.JPG", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lions-xtra/id957468093?mt=8"], "published": "2015-10-08T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:25:04.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
