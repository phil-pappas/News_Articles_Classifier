The .500 record can be deceiving, though, as the four victors — Webb City, Bentonville (Ark.), Har-Ber (Ark.) and Blue Springs South — have a combined 26-2 record. \n“They’ve certainly played some tough competition,” LePage said, “but in the same sense, so have we.” \nThe Hawklets are riding a three-game winning streak with wins against Blue Springs, Hickman and Helias — who combine for five total victories this season \n“This is basically a must-win for both teams,” LePage said. “Both teams are going into this football game wanting to win it badly.” \nGiven the team’s lengthy history, it only makes sense for both teams to be amped for the final regular season game. \n“I would be lying to say there isn’t a different feeling, because it is Rockhurst,” LePage said. “But we have to prepare our players to play as well as they can play. We want to respect the tradition and we want to respect Rockhurst. … We can only worry about Jeff City and what we do well.” \nThe Jays have done a lot well this season, proving they can excel in every facet of the game. For Rockhurst, the Kansas City-based team is centered around the talent of four-star senior A.J. Taylor. \nTaylor, a University of Wisconsin commit, can do it all. As the Hawklets’ star running back, Taylor also contributes at cornerback and on both sides of the special teams spectrum. \n“There’s no doubt he’s their best player all the way around,” LePage said of Taylor. “(Rockhurst) Coach (Tony) Severino’s philosophy is ‘I’m going to have my best guys on my field,’ and it has really paid dividends for him. I don’t think it affects A.J. Taylor because he expects to play every snap, and he does such a very good job.” \nFor example on Taylor’s versatility, last week the senior blocked a Helias field goal attempt, scooped it up and ran 75 yards for a touchdown. Taylor ran for 166 yards on 21 attempts and a touchdown in Rockhurst’s 35-25 win against Helias. \nThe Jays defense is allowing 157 rushing yards a game and a 4.7 average per carry. \nInstead of trying to stop Taylor, the Jays hope to limit his production. \n“I don’t know if you slow him down. We’re going to have to do a really good job on knowing where he’s at,” LePage said. “He’s a guy that scores from every different avenue. … The guy is all over the field, and I think he’s going to make plays no matter who he’s playing against just because of his extraordinary talent. \n“What you want to do though is make him line up and go again. He may rip off a run for four or 12 yards, we’ve got to be happy just putting him on the ground. Don’t let that turn into a 40-50 yard play. Don’t let him where his legs can carry him to a big play.” \nRockhurst is averaging 29 points per game, while the Jays are lighting up the scoreboard for 48 points a contest. \nThe Hawklets own a 24-14 advantage in a series that dates back to 1976. Rockhurst has won 16 of the last 17 meetings. \n“There is no doubt that there is nostalgia,” LePage said. “Our players know the tradition, they know exactly what this game means to our community and to the Rockhurst community.” \nThe game kicks off at 7 p.m. today at Adkins Stadium. \nNotes: The playing status of senior linebacker David Rogers (MCL) will be a game-time decision, according to LePage. Rogers has missed three straight games with the injury. … In common opponents, Rockhurst drubbed Hickman 50-0 two weeks ago and defeated Rock Bridge 26-7 back in Week 1. … The Jays currently sit in third place in their district standings behind two 8-0 teams in Blue Springs South and Francis Howell. Blue Springs South is at Lee’s Summit (3-5), while Francis Howell hosts Hickman (0-8). \nJefferson City hosts Rockhurst - Updates on Twitter: @AdamBurnsJC .
