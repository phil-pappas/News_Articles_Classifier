A key recommendation by Scala was shifting the power balance away from the elected members. \nThe existing executive committee under Scala's proposal would become a governing body elected by all 209 FIFA members with responsibility for \"strategic matters, supervision\" while a management board would take day-to-day decisions. A commercial board would deal with contracts and a development board would allocate funding to soccer projects. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:05:12.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
