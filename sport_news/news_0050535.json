(Photo: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports)\nCONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Nuggets finished with a 30-52 record last season (12th in the Western Conference). They ranked in the bottom half of the league in points allowed per game, turnovers and field goal percentage.\nUSA TODAY\nMinnesota Timberwolves preview: Young talent soldiers on without coach\nWhat’s different this season? Mike Malone, the Nuggets’ third coach in a year, is looking to turn around his struggling squad. The offseason was a good start, as Denver drafted standout point guard Emmanuel Mudiay for a steal with the seventh overall selection and parted ways with point guard Ty Lawson.\nHow good can they be? Coming off a 30-win season with a new coach and seemingly the same roster, don’t expect the Nuggets to be in the playoff picture this season. But they have good pieces that could shape up to form a much-improved team. The youth — Kenneth Faried, Will Barton, Gary Harris, Jusuf Nurkic and Mudiay — combined with the experience — Wilson Chandler, Danilo Gallinari, Randy Foye and Jameer Nelson — should blend together nicely this season.\nUSA TODAY\nOklahoma City Thunder preview: Look out, they're back\nHow far they have to go: Ever since the end of the Carmelo Anthony era, the Nuggets have lacked a true superstar. If everything goes as planned, Mudiay, 19, eventually could be the franchise player Denver so badly needs. The Nuggets are in a good spot now, but it surely will take some time.\nIs Malone ready? Malone has been an assistant coach for a variety of NBA teams, including the New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Charlotte Hornets and Golden State Warriors. He was head coach for the Sacramento Kings starting in 2013 and posted an overall record of 39-67 before he was fired last season. Can he turn this team around?\nThe Mudiay era is here: The 6-5, 200-pound guard isn’t going to put up Russell Westbrook-esque numbers in his first season. He has shown many strengths (ballhandling, quickness, court vision), but obviously some weaknesses as well (turnovers, shooting percentage).\nCONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809451769944598-USP-NBA--Preseason-Denver-Nuggets-at-Dallas-Maveri.1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4686c2ddcc775c3b56cfa792dcf9cc6693284bf9/c=480-0-2367-1887/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809451769944598-USP-NBA--Preseason-Denver-Nuggets-at-Dallas-Maveri.1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/074cbff8269ca5674ce20d8f9160f17bf3563e25/c=0-0-2510-1887&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809451769944598-USP-NBA--Preseason-Denver-Nuggets-at-Dallas-Maveri.1.jpg", "http://imgur.com/iYypP8I.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LUjf72&text=Denver%20Nuggets%20preview%3A%20New%20coach%20hoping%20to%20turn%20team%27s%20fortunes&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dfae5132133aa2c920b7227700c2c8c6a54c079a/c=0-340-2198-2538/local/-/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812815924992041-USP-NBA--Preseason-Minnesota-Timberwolves-at-Toron.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6613d7bb221e5019ccb18ca3b00fc398c4f4a29f/r=500x363/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809451769944598-USP-NBA--Preseason-Denver-Nuggets-at-Dallas-Maveri.1.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LUjf72&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-24T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:19:18.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
