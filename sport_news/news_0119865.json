I think words like 'awe,' 'amazement' and 'beauty' best describe what people were experiencing at that moment,\" said the Rev. Joshua Caswell, a member of the Canons Regular, the religious order that runs St. John Cantius, 825 N. Carpenter St. \"I saw tears in people's eyes. It's a very gratifying moment.\"\nSt. Maria Goretti, an 11-year-old Italian girl stabbed to death while resisting a sexual assault more than a century ago, will be on display for 24 hours at St. John Cantius Catholic Church in the Goose Island neighborhood before moving Tuesday to St. John Vianney in Northlake. She'll be on display Wednesday at St. Francis of Assisi in Orland Park and on Thursday at St. Mary Immaculate in Plainfield. Revered as a model of mercy, St. Maria Goretti is believed to have forgiven her killer and appeared to him later as an apparition, inspiring his conversion.\n\"Maria Goretti's story reads like a Chicago headline,\" Caswell said. \"What a summer of violence we've had. We want to experience the forgiveness and healing not only in theory but truly present among us. That's why we have her here is to experience that mercy.\"\nThe tour of the relics, which began at Sing Sing Correctional Facility outside New York City, sets the stage for a jubilee year called the Holy Year of Mercy. In March, Pope Francis announced the jubilee, beginning Dec. 8. A jubilee year is a special year called by the church to receive blessings and pardon from God. Pilgrims who venerate the relics also can receive a plenary indulgence.\nThe relics, which include most of the Italian child saint's skeleton encased in wax, are enclosed in a glass casket.\nThe American tour is only the second time the relics have left Italy, said the Rev. Carlos Martins, coordinator of the national tour.\nRemains of Catholics' youngest saint coming to Chicago Manya Brachear Pashman The remains of the youngest saint canonized by the Roman Catholic Church are expected to arrive in Chicago at dawn Monday as part of a 16-state tour during her first visit to the U.S.\nSt. Maria Goretti, an 11-year-old Italian girl stabbed to death while resisting a sexual assault more than a century...\nThe remains of the youngest saint canonized by the Roman Catholic Church are expected to arrive in Chicago at dawn Monday as part of a 16-state tour during her first visit to the U.S.\nSt. Maria Goretti, an 11-year-old Italian girl stabbed to death while resisting a sexual assault more than a century...\n(Manya Brachear Pashman) He selected the U.S. because he said St. Maria Goretti is in many ways an \"American saint, although she never set foot on American soil.\" Three of her five siblings immigrated to the U.S. after her death, said Martins, a historian and biographer of the saint.\nThe U.S. also made sense because of Pope Francis' historic first visit here last month. The relics were in Philadelphia at the same time as the pope, who approved the tour in advance of the Year of Mercy.\n\"There is a certain vindictiveness present in society today, particularly Western society, where we love to see someone beat up,\" Martins said. \"We call it justice, but it's really not justice. What Christ taught us is that a person is more important than his behavior. Maria reminds us of that.\"\nJudy Meyer, 51 of Kenosha, Wis., said she was sexually abused by her father when she was about 10 years old. For years she struggled with the scars of her childhood until finally, one day she decided to forgive him. She put him up in an apartment and took care of him until he died.\nMonday, Meyer and her two daughters venerated the young saint.\n\"I really love St. Maria Goretti,\" Meyer said. \"It was very moving for me to come here and to venerate the relic of a girl who actually did the same thing before me. Also the purity of her mind, to stay pure; that's why I brought my children, too, as an example to remain mindful of our thoughts and our actions and to be responsible for our bodies and our minds.\"\ngrwong@tribpub.com\nmbrachear@tribpub.com\nTwitter @GraceWong630\nTwitter @TribSeeker\n Pope Francis", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561abf9c/turbine/ct-saint-maria-goretti-met-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561befd1/turbine/ct-saint-maria-goretti-arrives-met-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:29:02.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
