They're competitors, they want the ball, everybody wants the ball. That day's coming, so we're going to get the ball to them and I told them that. But again, it's what happens in the game.\" \nIt's far too easy to criticize the team from the outside looking in simply by looking at the numbers. As poor as the passing numbers look, the rushing yards are equally as impressive, especially considering the question marks facing the offensive line heading into the season. \n\"I've said this all along that every game kind of has a story to it, and the story of that game was that we were running the ball very effectively,\" DeBord said. \"And you know, there were times I could have probably gone to the passing game but when the running game was going good, you know, we stayed with the running game. \n\"We've got to get our passing game involved more, and I will do that; we will do that. But in that game, you know, we were running the football. When you run for 250-plus yards against that defense, you're being effective. So we were staying with that.\" \nGames in the SEC are won more often than not by pounding the rock, not by throwing the ball all over the field. However it's fair to say Tennessee may be going to the well too often, especially when the defenses know what's coming in the fourth quarter. \nArkansas currently ranks last in the SEC in passing defense, giving up 264 yards through the air after four games. If Tennessee fails to have a balanced offensive gameplan once again, it may be time to start to ask if they ever will this season. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
