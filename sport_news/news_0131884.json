Barrett ran for two touchdowns and passed for two more as top-ranked Ohio State beat Penn State 38-10 on Saturday night. Royals blank Blue Jays 5-0 \nThe Buckeyes (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) have won 20 straight overall games and 27 consecutive conference regular-season contests. \nBarrett entered for starter Cardale Jones when the Buckeyes reached the red zone and by the fourth quarter was leading the offense full time. Barrett was for 4-of-4 for 30 passing yards and had 102 yards on 11 carries. \nOhio State running back Ezekiel Elliott ran for a score and had 153 rushing yards to surpass 100 yards for the 12th straight game but was topped by Penn State running back Saquon Barkley, who was questionable because of a foot injury but rushed for 194 yards on 26 carries. \nPenn State quarterback Christian Hackenberg opened the third quarter with an 8-yard TD pass to DaeSean Hamilton after a 56-yarder to Chris Godwin set up the score to make it 21-10. Hackenberg was 6 of 12 for 120 yards. \nThe Nittany Lions (5-2, 2-1) had a chance to pull to within 24-17 after a 56-yard run by Barkley in the fourth quarter but Hackenberg was sacked by Tommy Schutt for a 2-yard loss on fourth down from the Ohio State 13-yard line. \nBarrett made it 31-10 with 6:25 left on a 5-yard jump pass to Braxton Miller and later added a 6-yard scoring pass to Mike Thomas.Barrett took over for Jones in the red zone and directed the Buckeyes to three touchdowns and a 21-3 halftime lead. His second rushing touchdown of the second quarter, from 13 yards, came with three minutes left in the half. \nEarlier, Elliott capped a 45-yard drive with a 10-yard run around the right end, eluding four tacklers, to give Ohio State a 14-3 lead. \nBarrett took over a stagnant offense to start the second quarter at the Nittany Lions' 31 and needed four plays for the Buckeyes to go ahead 7-3 on his 5-yard run. He also rushed for 12 yards during the sequence. \nPrior to the Ohio State scoring drive, the Nittany Lions had a possible 10-0 lead on a 44-yard run by Barkley negated by a holding call. \nA Joey Julius 33-yard field goal on the Nittany Lions first drive of the game gave them a 3-0 lead. The big play was a 45-yard catch and run by Chris Godwin. \nIn other games involving Top 25 teams: \nNo. 2 Baylor 62, West Virginia 38 \nWACO, Texas -- Baylor stiff-armed West Virginia for most of the first three quarters before pulling away in the second half. \nBears quarterback Seth Russell passed for 380 yards and five touchdowns and rushed for 160 yards and a touchdown. Russell's 52-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jay Lee with 1:31 left in the third quarter gave Baylor (6-0) separation as the Bears pushed ahead 48-24. \nUntil then, West Virginia (3-3) had done enough to hang around and threaten to make a comeback. Quarterback Skyler Howard passed for 289 yards and four touchdowns, but he gave up an interception in the Baylor end zone as the Mountaineers squandered some key chances. \nNo. 3 TCU 45, Iowa State 21 \nAMES, Iowa -- Third-ranked Texas Christian's defense rose up after an awful first quarter and put an end to what was shaping up as a shootout. \nBlanking Iowa State in the last three quarters, the Horned Frogs improved to 7-0 with a 45-21 Big 12 Conference win on Saturday night at Jack Trice Stadium. After yielding 21 first-quarter points and 308 first-half yards, TCU tightened up considerably in the second half, forcing two turnovers and keeping the Cyclones (2-4, 1-2) off the scoreboard. \nMaking the feat more impressive was that it lost starting strong safety Denzel Johnson in the second quarter after he was ejected for targeting. \nMeanwhile, Horned Frogs quarterback Trevone Boykin did just about anything he wanted. Boykin completed 27 of 32 passes for 436 yards and four touchdowns while running 13 times for 74 yards and another score. \nNo. 5 Clemson 34, Boston College 17 \nCLEMSON, S.C. -- Sophomore quarterback Deshaun Watson passed for a season-high 420 yards and No. 5 Clemson shredded the nation's No. 1 defense for 532 yards in a 34-17 Atlantic Coast Conference victory against Boston College on Saturday night. \nThe Tigers (6-0, 3-0 ACC) posted their school-record 14th consecutive home victory. Clemson hasn't lost a home game since a 51-14 loss to Florida State midway through the 2013 season. \nBoston College (3-4, 0-4) entered the game having allowed just 140.3 yards per game, but the Eagles surrendered 139 to the Tigers in the first quarter. \nClemson built a 17-10 halftime lead, then coasted in the second half, scoring 17 unanswered points to take a 34-10 lead midway through the final period.Watson was the Tigers' catalyst, completing 27 of 41 passes for 420 yards and three touchdowns. He also rushed 11 times for 32 yards and another score. \nNo. 6 LSU 35, No. 8 Florida 28 \nBATON ROUGE, La. -- Kicker Trent Domingue burnished LSU coach Les Miles' reputation as The Mad Hatter by catching a lateral pass on a fake field goal and scampering 16 yards to lift the No. 6 Tigers to a 35-28 victory over No. 8 Florida on Saturday night. \nAfter Florida rallied from a 28-14 halftime deficit to tie the game at 28, Domingue lined up for a 33-yard field goal from the right hash mark early in the fourth quarter. Holder Brad Kragthorpe, a backup quarterback, took the snap and, while still on his knee, fired a lateral pass to Domingue, who had snuck out of the backfield to the left sideline. Domingue bobbled the ball twice -- even letting it hit his helmet -- before finally securing it and running untouched into the end zone behind an excellent double-team block by fullback Darrel Williams and tight end Colin Jeter on linebacker Jarrad Davis. \nNo. 10 Alabama 41, No. 9 Texas A&M 23 \nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas -- Running back Derrick Henry rushed for a career-high 236 yards and two touchdowns while freshman defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick returned a pair of interceptions for touchdowns as No. 10 Alabama trounced No. 9 Texas A&M 41-23 Saturday. \nDefensive back Eddie Jackson also returned an interception for a touchdown as the Crimson Tide (6-1, 3-1 SEC) recorded the second game with multiple touchdowns on interceptions in school history. \nQuarterback Kyle Allen was 20 of 40 for 263 yards with three interceptions and one touchdown for the Aggies (5-1, 2-1). \nNo. 11 Florida State 41, Louisville 21 \nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida State surged in the second half to beat Louisville while also extending its Atlantic Coast Conference winning streak to 28 games -- one shy of the record. \nThe Seminoles (6-0), who set that record with 29 straight conference victories from 1992-94 right after joining the ACC, got big play after big play in the second half after falling behind 7-6 at intermission. \nIt began less than two minutes into the third quarter with a 54-yard touchdown run by running back Dalvin Cook, then continued one drive later with a 70-yard scoring pass from quarterback Everett Golson to wideout Kermit Whitfield. Cook, Florida State's prized Heisman contender, finished the game with 163 yards rushing on 22 carries, and also caught four passes for 60 yards. \nMemphis 37, No. 13 Mississippi 24 \nMEMPHIS, Tenn. -- For the first six minutes of Saturday's matchup with Memphis at the Liberty Bowl, Mississippi looked like the No. 13 team in the country. \nBy halftime, the Tigers (6-0) looked more like a team from the SEC than the Rebels and things didn't get any better for Ole Miss, which lost 37-24 in front of a crowd of 60,241. \nOle Miss (5-2) jumped out to a two-score lead behind the passing of quarterback Chad Kelly, and a well-executed trick play from wide receiver Laquon Treadwell. \nThen, Memphis quarterback Paxton Lynch and the Tigers started to figure things out on offense. Lynch matched Kelly throw for throw, and then some. In the first half, he completed 19 of his 26 attempts for 191 yards. His two touchdowns were better than the Kelly's one. Lynch finished the game 39 of 53 for 384 yards and three scores. \nNo. 17 Iowa 40, No. 20 Northwestern 10 \nEVANSTON, Ill. -- Backup running back Akrum Wadley rushed for 204 yards and four touchdowns Iowa stayed unbeaten with a Big Ten victory over Northwestern. \nWadley, who carried 26 times, matched a Hawkeyes record for touchdowns shared by six others as Iowa improved to 7-0 for the first time since 2009. The Wildcats (5-2) dropped their second straight. \nHadley stepped in after starter Jordan Canzeri left late in the first quarter with an ankle injury. \nNo. 19 Oklahoma 55, Kansas State 0 \nMANHATTAN, Kan. -- Baker Mayfield passed for 282 yards and five touchdowns, all in the first half, as No. 19 Oklahoma blew out Kansas State 55-0 Saturday. \nThe Sooners were coming off a shocking loss to unranked Texas a week earlier. Oklahoma turned up the tempo offensively and had success from the start. \nKansas State was coming off back-to-back losses in which it led at halftime and let leads slip away. \nNo. 22 Toledo 63, Eastern Michigan 20 \nTOLEDO, Ohio -- Quarterback Phillip Ely passed for 327 yards and four touchdowns as Toledo improved to 6-0 for the first time since 1997. \nAfter the Rockets (6-0) led 28-6 at halftime, Ely threw touchdown passes on Toledo's first two possessions of the second half -- a strike of 55 yards to wide receiver Corey Jones and then an 88-yarder to wide receiver Cody Thompson four minutes later. \nToledo finished with 611 yards of total offense. Eastern Michigan (1-6) entered the game ranked 118th in scoring defense and 116th in total defense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:55:26.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
