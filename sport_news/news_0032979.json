Rigoletto has won two of his three career starts and his previous win last month was very impressive. In the hands of in-form jockey Trevor Patel, he certainly appeals most and likely to start as favourite. Rigoletto's stablemate Continental has similar career record. Though he had lost in his last run narrowly last month, he looks capable of toppling Rigoletto.\nBullrun, Multiglory , Magnificence and Intelligence are the others who can add colour to the finish. First race starts at 12.30 pm.\nSELECTIONS\n1. Jimmy Umrigar Trophy-DivII:Sans Peur 1, Majestic 2. 2. Pune Police Commissioner's Trophy-Div-II: Maleficent 1, Ashrafie 2. 3.
