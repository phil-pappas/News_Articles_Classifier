(AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) By TIM BOOTH The Associated Press SEATTLE â€” \nCam Newton threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Greg Olsen with 32 seconds left and the Carolina Panthers remained unbeaten, rallying for a stunning 27-23 win over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. \nNewton led the Panthers (5-0) to touchdowns on their final two possessions after trailing 23-14, the second straight week the Seahawks collapsed in the fourth quarter. Newton found Olsen wide open down the seam as All-Pros Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman looked at each other in confusion. \nNewton was 12 of 15 for 162 yards in the fourth quarter and threw for 269 yards overall. He led the Panthers on a pair of 80-yard touchdown drives in the final period as the Panthers improved to 5-0 for the second time in franchise history. \nIt was the second straight week the Seahawks (2-4) suffered a late defensive meltdown. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:59:20.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
