Hamilton was forced to retire from the Marina Bay circuit after his Mercedes car suffered a throttle malfunction, which reduced the Briton's championship lead over nearest challenger Nico Rosberg to 41 points. However, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel claimed his third win of the season after cruising to victory in Singapore, leaving him 49 points adrift of Hamilton in the drivers' championship standing. Reflecting on Ferrari's resurgence, Hamilton said that Vettel has been a serious threat for him since the Italian car manufacturer claimed their first win in Malaysia, the Guardian reported. The Briton also backed Mercedes to bounce back from the sudden defeat and hopes that the German car manufacturer would be able to reassert their monopoly in this week's Japanese Grand Prix.
