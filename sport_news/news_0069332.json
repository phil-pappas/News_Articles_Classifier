He signed a two-year, $11 million contract with the Raiders in 2014 after nine seasons with the New York Giants and will turn 33 not long after he hits free agency this offseason.\nRaiders coach Jack Del Rio said Tuck's MRI was \"not good\" Wednesday and did not speak with the media. Defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr. said he would leave any comments regarding Tuck to Del Rio, but several teammates were aware of Tuck's situation.\nIn five games, Tuck played 64.5 percent of the snaps (244 of 378), second only to Khalil Mack. A two-time Super Bowl champion with the Giants, Tuck has 66.5 career sacks, is one of Del Rio's council of veterans and considered a wise, dominant presence in the locker room.\n\"It'll be a challenge, not having him out there on the field, not having the leader of the team,\" Mack said. \"Having that type of injury is difficult, but it's one he's been positive about and we've been positive with him, letting him know we still want to see him around, see his face. Having his leadership is really more important than anything.\"\nFree safety Charles Woodson called Tuck a \"leader among men\" and didn't expect that part of his contribution to change, although he said Tuck will be missed in the defensive rotation up front.\n\"We'll miss him on the field. He's an important part of our defense,\" Woodson said. \"That's always tough, to replace one of your main guys.\"\nWith Tuck out, it will mean increased time for second-round draft pick Mario Edwards Jr., who is coming off his best game with six tackles and a sack with a season-high 50 snaps in a 16-10 loss to Denver.\nEdwards, like Tuck, can play end and also move inside to tackle in pass rush situations.\n\"Justin's been a great mentor, man,\" Edwards said. \"As for as reading keys and things like that, he's been a great help. He's been a great teammate and it sucks we can't have a veteran like him on the team because of injury. But Coach Del Rio says you've got to be ready. The season will go on, so we've got to be prepared.\"\nNorton has been impressed by Edwards' steady improvement.\n\"He's been versatile in the way we can play him inside and outside,\" Norton said. \"It seems like everywhere we put him, he makes plays and he plays really hard.\"\nDefensive tackle Dan Williams described Tuck's absence as \"a huge loss\" given his ability to identify formations keep young players lined up correctly. He said Tuck will be missed for more than just his leadership.\n\"He's quick, gets off the ball, still makes great pass rush moves,\" Williams said. \"It's definitely going to hurt us in the long run.\"\nBesides Edwards, Raiders expected to pick up the slack include Denico Autry, who is sidelined with a concussion, end Benson Mayowa, and end/tackle C.J. Wilson. Another possibility is elevating Shelby Harris, who had a strong preseason, from the practice squad.\n(c)2015 The Oakland Tribune (Oakland, Calif.)\nVisit The Oakland Tribune (Oakland, Calif.) at www.insidebayarea.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1738490&h=Source%3A+Raiders%27+Justin+Tuck+needs+surgery%2C+out+for+season", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1738490&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1738490"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:06:51.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
