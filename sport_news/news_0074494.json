Overall I think it's good stuff and we can build off it, and these are the teams we want to play against.\" \nThe Americans extended their home unbeaten streak to 101 matches, their last loss coming on Nov. 6, 2004, against Denmark in Philadelphia during a post-Olympic victory tour after the 2004 Athens Games. \nAnd it was Lloyd making sure the streak continued. Lloyd was the Golden Ball winner at the Women's World Cup as the most outstanding player and capped the championship with the fastest hat trick in tournament history in the final against Japan. She has a career-high 17 goals this season. \nShe was in the right place against the Brazilians to finally capitalize after the U.S. missed a number of chances earlier. \n\"I thought we got better in the second half and created a lot more chances and got stronger,\" U.S. coach Jill Ellis said. Advertisement \nBrazilian defender Monica scored on a header off a corner kick in the third minute. The header beat goalkeeper Hope Solo and was the earliest goal allowed by the U.S. in at least two years. \nAlex Morgan had two good chances in the first half, missing wide on a header minutes after the opening goal and later had a left-footed volley saved by Luciana. \nIt was the final game for midfielder Shannon Boxx, who retired after 195 appearances for the national team. Boxx started and was the team captain, checking out in the 41st minute. Boxx received a standing ovation from the crowd and her teammates on the U.S. bench. \nBoxx was a three-time Olympic champion and returned from a knee injury and the birth of her daughter in February 2014 to make the World Cup roster and add a final title to her resume. \n\"I'm going out as a World Cup champion. I'm going out on my own terms,\" Boxx said. \"That's pretty amazing.\" \nMorgan says she still with the Portland Thorns. For now. \nThe former Cal star played 90 minutes in Wednesday's match amid reports that she was on the verge of being sent to the expansion Orlando Pride of the National Women's Soccer League. \nMorgan has played with Portland for the past three seasons. The new Orlando team was announced Tuesday and will begin play next season. Morgan's husband, Servando Carrasco, plays for Major League Soccer's Orlando City. \n\"I'm with Portland as of right now, so nothing's confirmed,\" Morgan said after the match. \"Obviously, my husband does play there, so I'm in Orlando a lot, but there's nothing right now that I can confirm.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:47:28.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
