Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News Summary \nInjuries can change a season for a player or team, but are there more of them in the modern game? Or does more media attention make it seem like there are more injuries? “ Historically, when I think about it, my instinct is that it comes in waves. I also think certain types of injuries come in waves. I’m not sure why.” Former BYU and NFL quarterback Steve Young \nAs the 2015 football season approached, fans eagerly anticipated the senior seasons of BYU ’s Taysom Hill, Utah’s Travis Wilson and Utah State’s Chuckie Keeton. \nHill was lost to BYU in the season opener. Before conference play began, Keeton suffered a sprained knee and will miss four to six weeks. \nWilson suffered a shoulder injury that kept him out of the Fresno State game, but not the massive win at Oregon. Both Wilson and Ute head coach Kyle Whittingham said the California native isn’t 100 percent, although they hope the bye week gives him time to heal completely. \nWhether it’s high school, college or pro football, injuries are almost always a factor in how a season takes shape. But are those injuries becoming more common or more severe? Several Pac-12 coaches and a former BYU and NFL great don’t believe so. \n“It’s a difficult sport,” said former BYU and San Francisco quarterback Steve Young, who will be in Salt Lake in October as part of the Forever Young Foundation’s Give Salt Lake project. “It seems like it comes in waves, and it seems like we’re in a wave.” \nThe seven-time Pro Bowler and three-time Super Bowl champion said he understands why fans and media might believe that injuries are getting worse, especially when those impacted are among the game’s most high-profile players. \n“Historically, when I think about it, my instinct is that it comes in waves,” he said. “I also think certain types of injuries come in waves. I’m not sure why.” \nStanford head coach David Shaw isn’t sure that there are more injuries — or more serious injuries — caused by the game, or if constant media coverage just makes them more visible. \n“It’s always been a big part of (the game),” Shaw said during Tuesday’s Pac-12 teleconference. “It’s always been the reason you recruit depth. Some of the recruiting you do almost every single day is because you need depth. This is a sport of attrition.” \nIn fact, he said some of the game’s greatest stories began with a player getting his first opportunity after a teammate is injured. \n“It’s just the way the sport is,” he said. \nUCLA’s Jim Mora agrees with Young and Shaw, even after losing his best linebacker, Myles Jack, for the season. \n“I think it’s always been part of the game,” Mora said. “I think we are just more aware of injuries now. There are daily updates on every team.” \nWhen asked if the fact that players are bigger, faster and stronger or that the modern game features more plays than in the past, he said no. \n“The guy causing the collision is bigger, faster, stronger,” he said, “but the guy taking the hit is bigger, faster, stronger.” \nThe reality is that football is a sport in which injuries are a part of the game plan. \nHe said players understand it and accept it, even when it changes their season. \n“Your immediate concern is always for the guy who is injured,” Mora said. \nAfter that, it’s who can fill that void for the team. \n“I’ve been doing this for 30-something years, and I’ve never seen anybody doing it any different,” he said, acknowledging that those outside the sport may ruminate on injuries or what-ifs, but those on the team usually do not. \nThe team has no choice but to deal with its new reality. \n“Players understand that,” Mora said. \nTwitter: adonsports Recommended Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:48:22.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
