By Terry Blount thepigskinner@hotmail.com \nWelcome to Week 5 of the fantasy football season. This week our bye teams will be Carolina, Miami, Minnesota and the New York Jets. \nSTART ’EM \nI was beginning to believe that St. Louis Rams running back Todd Gurley was either a yeti or the Loch Ness Monster. After all, we kept hearing about the actual existence of the rookie from Georgia but there was no evidence that he was real. Since the preseason we kept hearing things such as “he might play this week” while recovering from a knee injury he suffered in college. Well, Gurley finally got some real playing time in Week 4 and showed why the Rams were willing to draft an injured player and have the patience to wait for him to heal. Gurley racked up 146 rushing yards and two receptions for 20 receiving yards last week and could be primed for a better game in Week 5. St. Louis will face a Green Bay Packers defense that has allowed 115 rushing yards per game. Granted, Gurley might not get as many carries if the Rams have to play from behind, but I would have a hard time benching the kid with such a positive matchup. Gurley should be a great choice as a RB2 this week and could gain even more fantasy value as the season progresses. He does exist! \nSometimes a tight end or wide receiver can actually help a running back post nice numbers. Case in point: San Diego Chargers tight end Antonio Gates returns from suspension this week, and I believe his presence will actually boost the fantasy stats of running back Melvin Gordon . Gates should occupy a linebacker or defensive back in coverage that might have otherwise stayed in the box and helped with the run defense. San Diego has a so-so matchup versus the 18th ranked Pittsburgh Steelers run defense allowing 113.3 yards per game, but I believe Gates will open things up for Gordon. Consider Gordon a strong RB2 this week. \nSpeaking of Gates, he’ll face a Steelers defense that allowed three touchdowns to New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski in Week 1, but have done a great job since against the position. However, I still regard Gates as a solid TE1, as Pittsburgh has not faced a tight end of Gates’s talent since facing Gronkowski. \nSIGN HIM, BUT… \nJacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Allen Hurns has scored touchdowns in back-to-back contests, including a Week 4 line of 11 receptions, 116 receiving yards and a touchdown on an impressive 15 targets. This week he might not find the going as easy as he has a tough matchup against a Tampa Bay pass defense that has allowed a mere 185.5 yards per game (second in the league). I like this guy’s potential going forward, but hate this week’s matchup. Try to snag him from your league’s waiver wire, but be advised to wait for stronger opportunities before starting him. He has better upcoming matchups versus Houston and Buffalo. \nQUICK HITS \nSan Francisco 49ers running back Carlos Hyde has been losing statistical ground of late, cumulating in a 20 yard performance last week. His fortunes won’t be any better this week versus a league-best New York Giants rushing defense. Look at someone else. \nJaguars running back T.J. Yeldon had his best game as a pro in Week 4, posting 22 carries for 105 rushing yards. He has a great matchup this time out versus a horrid Tampa Bay run defense hemorrhaging 136.8 rushing yards per game (30th in the league). He could help in a pinch as a bye week replacement. \nWith the Dallas Cowboys defense allowing the third-most fantasy points to running backs and third-most rushing touchdowns, look for a nice performance from Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount this week. It’s a great matchup. \nThe Chicago Bears will roll into Arrowhead Stadium in Week 5 to face a Kansas City team in turmoil. While the Chiefs defense has allowed the most fantasy points to the quarterback position in 2015, I still don’t like the fantasy fortunes of Chicago quarterback Jay Cutler . He’s in turmoil as well, “leading” a Bears passing offense producing a mere 190 passing yards per game (30th in the NFL).
