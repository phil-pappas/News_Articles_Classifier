They are always pushing the team. Their performances are always very important.\" \nThe result adds to what has been a very creditable start to the season for Watford, who now have 13 points from 10 games and are up to 13th in the table, a place and a point clear of Stoke. \n\"I'm really happy with the performance of the team,\" Flores said. \n\"We played really well today - with a lot of confidence. The balance of the team was amazing, and when we play like this it is very difficult for Stoke and for other teams also.\" \nStoke were guilty of errors when both goals went in, the first seeing Philipp Wollscheid slip as Deeney shaped to shoot and the second Ighalo feed Abdi having dispossessed Marc Wilson, who had come on early for the injured Geoff Cameron. \nThe Potters had gone into the contest on a three-match winning run in the Premier League and boss Mark Hughes admitted he had been left mystified by the performance his players produced on his 100th game in charge at the club. \n\"We were poor today, and credit to Watford,\" Hughes said. \n\"They came here with a good game plan and worked hard at it. They had a good threat up top with the two lads (Deeney and Ighalo) up front, who messed us around all day long to be honest. \n\"We needed to be better and we did not really see that performance coming. We have been playing well of late and getting good results. \n\"You have to put it down to individual errors, collective errors and the good play of the opposition.\" \nRegarding Cameron, who limped off in the ninth minute, Hughes added: \"It looks like he has pulled his thigh unfortunately. \n\"I think it is fair to say that probably disrupted us, but we can't hide behind that. There were good players on the pitch today and we should have done better.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:22:01.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
