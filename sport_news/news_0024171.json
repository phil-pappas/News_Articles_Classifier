Overbrook remains very much alive for one of the eight South Jersey Group 2 playoff berths. \nFrom a team that was 2-8 a year ago, this is a dramatic difference. \n\"It's such a huge improvement over last year,\" said junior running back and cornerback Marques DeShields, who rushed for 185 yards and three touchdowns. \"Everybody wants to be here.\" \nWhat made this win special was that Haddon Heights (1-5) had scored 85 points in its previous two games, including last week's 42-36 double-overtime loss to defending South Jersey Group 1 champion Paulsboro. Yet the Garnets met resistance from a stubborn Overbrook defense, one that includes 5-foot-4, 135-pound linebacker Mitch Baraldi, who also doubles as a punishing running back. \n\"He was all over the place,\" Wilczynski said of Baraldi. \nHeights scored first on Nick Smith's ninth touchdown reception of the season, a 33-yard pass from Matt DiOrio. \nThen DeShields gave the Rams a 7-6 lead with a 13-yard run on the last play of the first quarter. \nBoth teams had chances in the middle two periods, but there was no scoring. \n\"We hurt ourselves with too many untimely penalties and mistakes,\" said Heights coach Ralph Schiavo. \nWhile the defeat was difficult for Schiavo, he also felt good for Wilczynski, his former pupil. Wilczynski is a former Rowan quarterback, and Schiavo was there as the quarterbacks coach. \n\"Frank has done a great job with this team,\" Schiavo said. \nAfter DeShields broke several tackles en route to a 49-yard touchdown run, Heights got to within 13-12 when Roman Massi scored on a 22-yard run with 7 minutes, 28 seconds left. \nHeights went for the two-point conversion, but DeShields and teammate Gio Washington both batted down the pass. \nThe 5-8, 185-pound DeShields then sealed the win with a 19-yard scoring run. \n\"We have gained our confidence as a team,\" DeShields said. \nWilczynski, who was an assistant last year, deserves a lot of credit. \nAs a coach, he doesn't want the team to be complacent but also knows they should enjoy this success. \nAnd the way things are going, the Rams appear headed toward playing more meaningful football once October turns to November. \nHaddon Heights 6 0 0 0 - 6 \nOverbrook 7 0 0 14 - 21 \nH: Nick Smith 33 pass from Matt DiOrio (run failed) \nO: Marques DeShields 13 run (Jagger Pinto kick) \nO: DeShields 49 run (kick failed) \nH: Roman Massi 22 run (pass failed) \nO: DeShields 19 run (Jared Montalto pass from Tom Wyatt)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:51:31.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
