In fact Calipari should take a look at the San Antonio Spurs on how to play Briscoe, a McDonald’s All-American. \nBriscoe should be the college version of Manu Ginobili, who is one of the best foreign players in NBA history. While Ginobili is one of the key three for the Spurs along with Tim Duncan and Tony Parker, but is never thought of as a starter. Gregg Popovich has always brought Ginobili off the bench as a sixth starter. \nThat’s exactly what Calipari should do for Briscoe. The way he can score, whether it’s using his strength and creativity at the rim or shooting from deep, there are similarities to Ginobili in that sense. More importantly he’s the much needed super-sub, someone who can change the game when the starters are winded or there needs to be a change. Briscoe can attack against a tired starter for an opponent or take advantage against weaker competition. \nIt goes two ways though as Briscoe needs to embrace the Manu role. If this can happen, it just makes Kentucky that more dangerous. Article written by Bobby Reagan One time representative of UK at SEC 3v3 basketball championships.
