He acts a lot more like a mature father of three than a hot-shot major league pitcher. \nThe 36-year old righthander does not possess a blazing fastball. He doesn't glower and stomp around on the mound. He has not been an instigator of any of the Royals highly-publicized confrontations/brawls. He is the lowest-paid pitcher on the Royals roster.\nWhat he does do is mix up his pitches, change speeds and hits spots. At his best, he appears to be one step ahead of the hitters, using their strengths against them.\nIn short, the Princeton graduate out thinks the hitter. Perhaps that's why Royals Manager Ned Yost will start Young against baseball's top offense in Tuesday's game-4.\nHe's got really good numbers against these guys,\" Yost told the media on Sunday. His last two starts of the year were really, really good. We feel like he gives us a good chance to win.\"\nNot everyone agrees. \n\"The Royals should not start Chris Young in Game 4.\"\nThat was Monday's headline at the Royals Review website.\nThe writer's point is that a fly ball pitcher like Chris Young is vulnerable to fly ball hitters in a smaller ballpark like Toronto's Rogers Centre.\n\"When a Blue Jays hitter hits a fly ball, where does it land?\" Shaun Newkirk writes. \"For several Blue Jays players, that ball lands on the other side of the fence.\"\nMonday, Young said he understands the challenge.\n\"You have to make good pitches, no  matter where you are,\" he said. \"The challenge is to execute pitches, choose the right pitches, no matter where you are.\"\nAs for pitching in the hitter-friendly Roger Centre, Young says it's not about the ball park. \"I've had bad games in pitcher's parks and good games in hitter's parks. It's about the pitching, not the park.\"\nYoung's only 2015 postseason appearance was in game-1 of the Astros series, when he relieved Yordano Ventura. Young threw four innings, surrendering three hits and one run. The run came on a homer off a fastball.\nThat appearance followed two excellent starts to end the season, including his five innings of hitless baseball against Cleveland on September 27.\nSo, like it or not \"seamheads,\" Ned Yost in going with his veteran in game-4.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
