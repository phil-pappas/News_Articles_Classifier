She's a real presence,\" Nielsen said of Clark. \"But everybody picked up their intensity and made up for it.\"\nBenet indeed didn't miss a beat Thursday without its Michigan-bound senior, taking care of host Naperville Central 25-18, 25-15.\nClark bruised her heel in Tuesday's match against Nazareth, re-aggravating an injury first suffered in last year's state semifinal.\nShe was in full uniform Thursday, her heel wrapped. Benet coach Brad Baker doesn't expect Clark to miss much more time — in fact, if she had her way she would have played.\n\"It was my call,\" Baker said. \"She wasn't happy about it.\"\nGretchen Rudel had eight kills, Veronica Snelling and sophomore Lilly Johnson five, and Nielsen added 22 assists for Benet (19-1), which won its 14th straight match since a loss to York in the Benet Invite final.\nMichigan recruit Tiffany Clark sits, but Benet beats Naperville Central Jeff Krage / Naperville Sun Benet's Veronica Snelling goes up for a block during Thursday's match at Naperville Central. Benet's Veronica Snelling goes up for a block during Thursday's match at Naperville Central. (Jeff Krage / Naperville Sun) That business-as-usual success belies what is quite a young team.\nWithout Clark, Benet's only senior starters are middles Lauren Berta and Lina Lietuvninkas.\nAge, though, is nothing but a number to Nielsen and her coach.\n\"We don't make excuses for anything,\" said Nielsen, a Minnesota recruit. \"If we're young, we're young. The goal here stays the same.\"\nAdded Baker: \"People use the young excuse when they're not good. Either you can play volleyball or you can't. I don't care how old you are.\"\nSarah Schank had six kills and Claudia Wodziak contributed four kills and a block for Naperville Central (7-14). Samatha Kurm's kill to start Game 2 gave the Redhawks their only lead of the match, but their coach saw progress from a two-game loss Tuesday against Metea Valley.\n\"I liked our energy,\" Central coach Jeff Danbom said. \"I thought what we were able to bring was very good for our developmental stage. We're one more step to where we need to get to.\"\nThe Redhawks were hampered by chasing early deficits in both games.\nThree Central errors contributed to Benet's 4-0 lead to start the match, with Snelling depositing a Redhawks overpass for the other early point. Wodziak's tip got it to 6-3, but a 6-1 Benet run followed — punctuated by a Johnson smash from the pin.\nLefty outside Snelling threw down another attempt to get Benet off to a 5-1 start in Game 2, which eventually ballooned to 10-3.\nEven when Central scrapped to keep rallies alive, Benet matched it and had the firepower to finish.\n\"Benet is very disciplined,\" Danbom said. \"They're not a team you are going to go on big point runs on. They are a team you need to stay tight with. To be battle back from a four-point deficit is very difficult.\"\nThe two teams, usual sectional rivals, won't be this year with Benet shipped to Lyons with Mother McAuley.\nBenet's schedule amps up the next two weeks in anticipation of that playoff push.\nThe Redwings are at Glenbard West next Wednesday, followed by Mizuno Cup and Glenbard East's Autumnfest the following two weekends. Central also is at both of those tournaments.\n\"Our schedule is going to get tougher, and that's good,\" Baker said. \"The next few weeks we hope to get a challenge. We want them now before the playoffs.\"\nJoshua Welge is a freelance writer for the Naperville Sun.\nCopyright © 2015, Naperville Sun Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560de9b0/turbine/ct-nvs-girls-volleyball-benet-naperville-central-st-1002-20151001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560de846/turbine/ct-nvs-girls-volleyball-benet-naper-2-jpg-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:32:04.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
