Human rights activists say all Eritreans are forced to join the army at 17, supposedly for two years of national service, but claim many are not allowed to leave. \nThe government of Eritrea, a country of around six million people on the northeast coast of Africa, has been accused by human rights groups of being among the most repressive in the world. The United Nations released a report this year alleging, among other abuses, that forced and prolonged military service was common. \nThe players are being represented by human rights lawyer Dick Bayford, who works for the South Africa-based Eritrean Movement for Democracy and Human Rights. \nIn 2012, 17 Eritrea players and a team doctor went missing during a tournament in Uganda and eventually applied for asylum. It later emerged that they had been granted asylum in the Netherlands. \nThe entire Eritrean team sought refugee status at the same regional tournament in 2009. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:44:03.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
