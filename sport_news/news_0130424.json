He claimed it was the best year of his bowling career, but he put a lot of time into it. “It’s a very prestigious award,” he said, “and it’s an honor to earn it. I knew I racked up a lot of points during the year, so I wasn’t surprised when I won the award.” During the season, he would add seven more 300’s and five more 800 series. Along with his Bowler of the Year honor was a scratch team title in the Southeastern Mass. USBC Bowling Association’s tournament at Wonder Bowl last spring and high averages of 234, 231, 230 and 226 between his four leagues at Wonder Bowl and Holiday Lanes in Westport. Besides the Bowler of the Year honors, Borges’ highlight of the year was last February when he tied a then-Wonder Bowl and association record 876 series. (Tyler Perry, a junior bowler at the time, bowled an identical score more than a year before). “I came into Wonder Bowl that night running late,” he said. “So, I was cold going into the first game with no warmup. I bowled a 300 that game and a 298 the second game by bowling 23 straight strikes. The last game was a 278.” His (and Perry’s) association and Wonder Bowl’s record was broken two weeks later by Josh Corum’s 878 series. On April 1, the association record toppled again when Jay Correia bowled an 891 series at Holiday Lanes in Westport. “I didn’t let the record getting away from me bother me,” said Borges. “I’m still young and have plenty of time to accomplish more.” On weekends, he bowls in New England Bowling Association (NEBA) tournaments. He only missed one all season. His highest finish was fourth and he’s in the top-12 in points. “At the end of the year,” he said, “the top-16 in points get a free entry into the end of the year tournament. I want to make this tournament. I missed it last year by 12 points.” He started bowling at age 9 in the Junior Program at Wonder Bowl. He started halfway through the season and didn’t bowl that first summer. “During that summer, though,” Borges said, “I was fooling around with friends and started bowling with a two-handed delivery. I perfected it and the next season my average was up 40 pins. I decided that was the way I was going to bowl for the rest of my life.” That was even before he had ever heard of (PBA member) Jason Belmonte bowling two-handed. He remembers seeing a picture of Belmonte on the cover of Bowler’s Journal International and saying, “he bowls just like me.” Broges moved to Port Charles, Florida, shortly thereafter and bowled his first 300 game (he has 24 career 300’s and 17 800’s). He stayed in Florida for a couple of years and moved back to New Bedford at 17 and joined the adult leagues. The first season back home, he bowled his first 800, an 821. Borges would love to bowl in PBA Regional Tournaments, but claims he doesn’t have much of a chance to practice on the sport shots that he would encounter in PBA events. He’d also like to be on staff for a bowling-related company, so he could gain some experience. This year he’s cut back from four leagues to two — Holiday Trios in Westport and the Twilight League at Wonder Bowl. In the meantime, he’d like to repeat as the Jim Rusin Memorial Bowler of the Year. He’s off to a slow start, however, only bowling a 299 high game so far. “It’s still early,” he said. Upcoming events A Senior Eastern Massachusetts Bowling Association (SEMBA) over 50 Scratch Tournament is Oct. 18 at Boston Bowl at 10 a.m. Entry fee is $100 per bowler. The Massachusetts State USBC Youth Association 33rd annual Singles Tournament is Nov. 8 at AMF Auburn Lanes at 11 a.m. Entry fee is $25 per bowler and entries close on Oct. 14.

Walk-ins are welcome based on lane availability. Entry fee is $38 per bowler. Highlights Alex Aguiar and Matt O’Grady won the NEBA Turbo Driven to Bowl Doubles at East Providence Lanes on Oct. 4. This is Aguiar’s 17th title which moves him into second place on the NEBA title list behind Michael Lichstein’s 28 titles. Richard Jackson, in the Westport Trios at Holiday Lanes in Westport, bowled a 300 game on September 28. Tiler Levesque, in the Next Generation Junior League at Wonder Bowl, bowled a 706 series that included 224, 235 and 247 games. Trevor Kobza, in the A.M. Junior Program at Wonder Bowl, bowled a 722 series that included 225, 279 and 218 games. Cory DeTerra, in the Pioneer League at Wonder Bowl, bowled a 278 game that was 112 pins over his average. On a sad note: Bernice Calnan, who bowled at the former Bowlers Country Club in Fairhaven (Fairhaven’s Women’s Classic League), passed away last week after a brief illness.
