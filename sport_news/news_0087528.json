Hopefully, I can go out there and have a good match and go out of the court saying: 'Look, I played Singapore for the first time, I did my best.'\n\"If I lose it's okay but if I win, it will be amazing. But I am not trying to think about results here too much.\"\nFellow Singapore finalist Agnieszka Radwa≈Ñska, who has lost her last four matches against Muguruza, predicted that the Spaniard had the potential to become world number one.\nThe Spaniard knows that while she has a long way to go to make that happen, it is not beyond the realms of possibility.\n\"I think I'm getting closer and closer and have the possibility to be there if I work hard,\" Muguruza added.\n\"I still have to do a lot of things, work and improve, but I think I'm heading in the right direction to make it happen.\"\nMuguruza is also playing down her chances of winning a tournament that has been thrown wide open after a fatigued Williams withdrew.\n\"Well, I have earned my place here so I am definitely at this level but I don't regard myself as a favorite,\" said Muguruza.\n\"I have played really well this month and hopefully I can continue to do so, but I don't know. The first time, sometimes it's hard to deal with so let's just see what happens.\"\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:22:25.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
