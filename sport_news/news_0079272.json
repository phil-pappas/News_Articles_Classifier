MARIETTA — Kell used nine rushers to gain 286 yards in a 52-7 victory over North Atlanta on Friday. Dre’ Houston led the Longhorns with 65 yards on nine carries. With Riverwood’s win over Cambridge on Friday, Kell holds the point-differential tiebreaker and now holds first place in Region 7 (B), and it will have a chance to secure the No. 1 seed when it plays Sprayberry on Friday. “A couple weeks back when things weren’t going our way, we had a team meeting,” Kell coach Derek Cook said. “We decided we needed to get back to basics and become a more physical team like we used to be. We’ve started running the ball more effectively, and stopping the run. The focus isn’t really on what’s happening on the other side, it’s about us and what we’re doing. I think that’s shown up in games.”Houston opened the scoring less than a minute into the contest when he dove in from 3 yards to put Kell ahead 7-0. The score came just two plays after linebacker DeQuarius Manuel intercepted a pass on the game’s first play from scrimmage, and returned it to the North Atlanta 6-yard line. “We went after them on the offensive line, defensive line, and in the pass game as well,” Cook said. “We had that interception on that first play of the game which obviously gets the momentum going. We scored right away and then got another because our defense made a stop and gave us a short drive.”Tailback Josiah Futral scored on another 3-yard touchdown run, extending Kell’s lead to 14-0 with 4:45 left in the first quarter. Futral finished with 58 yards on eight carries. Quarterback John Lampley threw three touchdown passes in the second quarter. Twice he connected with Evan Carnes and once to Bryson Armstrong. Kell took a 42-7 lead into the locker room, and Lampley finished the game 8-of-14 passing for 94 yards. Tyler Weathers scored the final touchdown of the night in the third quarter, a 5-yard score that capped an 8-play, 65-yard drive to put Kell ahead 49-7. Kicker Julien Chang also put an exclamation point on the senior night victory with a 44-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:31:46.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
