Both are visual storytellers recognized for elevating their love of adventure through their work behind the lens. Internationally renowned and respected, Richards was named National Geographic Adventurer of the Year in 2012, while Ditto received mountaineering's highest award, the Piolet d'Or in 2011.\n\"Cory and Ben are phenomenal talents and natural additions to our guide and athlete team,\" said Mike Egeck , chief executive officer of Eddie Bauer . \"Their passion for the outdoors and ability to illustrate adventure through photography is what distinguishes them in the industry. We look forward to supporting them as adventurers and artists.\"\nHaving traveled to the far reaches of the globe, Richards made a name for himself in 2011 when he climbed Pakistan's Gasherbrum II, making him the first American to summit an 8,000-meter peak during winter. He would go on to create a documentary about his experience and take home the coveted Grand Prize at the 2011 Banff Mountain Film Festival for his film, \"Cold .\" Richards has since pursued a number of projects that continue to push him both physically and creatively, as he seeks to capture not only the soul of adventure and exploration, but also the beauty inherent in modern society. Today as a National Geographic photography fellow, Richards is a renowned photojournalist whose images are often featured in media around the world.\nDitto has climbed virgin walls and summits in remote areas across the world, from the Indian Himalayas to the Peruvian and Patagonian Andes. In 2011, he was awarded the prestigious Piolet d'Or for a climbing expedition that accessed previously unclimbed areas and established nine first ascents in Greenland . Due to the region's unique topography, the rock faces were inaccessible by land, requiring the three-month expedition to be based entirely from a sailboat. Always in search of adventure, Ditto and his team returned in 2014 and established another 10 alpine style wall climbs along the East Coast of Baffin Island and West Coast of Greenland . His diverse skill-set makes him a key member of high alpine climbing and ski mountaineering expeditions. During the summers, he can be found in Yosemite Valley where he serves as the \"climber in residence,\" a position which allows him long periods of time in the legendary climbing venue.\nRichards and Ditto join an elite roster of guides and athletes for Eddie Bauer , who each bring the highest level of expertise and experience across a multitude of outdoor disciplines. Their portfolios are featured on Eddie Bauer's Guide and Athlete website, http://team.eddiebauer.com , which offers insights on each of the 34 team members along with powerful images and videos from their expeditions. Key members include climbers such as Ed Viesturs , Dave Hahn , Melissa Arnot , and Mason Earle .\nAbout Eddie Bauer\nEstablished in 1920 in Seattle, Eddie Bauer is a specialty retailer that sells premium-quality outerwear, apparel, footwear, gear and accessories for the active outdoor lifestyle.
