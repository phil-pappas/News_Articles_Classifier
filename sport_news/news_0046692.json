You do not send them a bill. You are not allowed to do that.”\nBut the no-show couple was wrong as well, she said. Jessica Baker told ABC News that her mother was supposed to babysit the couple’s young children but canceled at the last minute because of illness. The couple chose not to notify the bride and groom.\n“They needed to let the bride and groom or some responsible party know as soon as they knew,” said Smith.\nPulling a no-show causes logistical problems for the bride and groom at weddings. There is also the chance you could cause emotional stress on the bride and groom, who may reasonably believe that something bad has happened to you, said Smith. Instead of remaining quiet, you should put a call in to a family member/friend attending the event or even the catering manager at the venue, she said.\n“This is a classic example of two rudes don’t make a right,” said Smith. “The wedding guest did something that was rude, the bride and groom did something that was rude, and nobody was right in this situation.”\nTen percent of people who RSVP “yes” to weddings ultimately do not go, said Smith. This is industry standard.\n“Life happens,” said Smith. “This is part of being a mature adult. And this is something that the bride and groom are going to have to learn.”\nAlso, guests are never, contrary to popular belief, indebted to the bride and groom for the cost of their meal, said Smith.\n“Invitations are not invoices,” said Smith. “They are not inviting you as a fundraiser. They are inviting you as a special person in their life.”\nThis is a classic example of two rudes don’t make a right - Jodi RR Smith\nIf someone were to throw a lavish wedding that was $500 a plate, guests would not be expected to give a $1,000 gift, said Smith. They should, however, give something — even if they don’t attend.\nThe newlyweds, who have not been identified, offered this statement to ABC News:\nWe apologize for not being tactful in expressing our disappointment in your absence. We waited three weeks after the wedding for any correspondence and received nothing, this along with your last minute RSVP caused us to act on emotion rather than logic.\nBaker posted the bill on her personal Facebook page and also the Facebook page of a Minneapolis-St. Paul news station, where it went viral — another big no-no, said Smith.\nIt’s one thing to vent about a company in a public way on social media, but quite another to vent about a family member.\n“She’s also, on top of it, putting her husband in a terrible position with his family,” said Smith. “I would be horrified to go to any of his family’s gatherings after doing something this rude.”", "external_links": ["http://www.mannersmith.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/KARE11/photos/a.212595130456.257855.148260880456/10156163626870457/?type=3&theater", "http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/minnesota-woman-billed-bride-missing-wedding/story?id=34160008", "https://www.facebook.com/KARE11", "https://www.facebook.com/KARE11/posts/10156163626870457:0"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:04:48.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
