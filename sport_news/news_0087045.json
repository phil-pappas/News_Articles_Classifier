Syndergaard actually allowed two earned runs or less in seven of his 12 road starts including both of his September starts away from Citi Field.\n\"To me, it's just all about getting comfortable out there on the mound on the road,\" said Syndergaard, who will face the LA Dodgers in Game 2 of the NLDS at Dodger Stadium on Saturday. \"I feel like in the last couple starts I had on the road I had a lot of success, a lot of comfort.\n\"The big thing for me was being able to execute my pitches and become more of a pitcher, not a thrower. And I feel like that's going to play a huge role (in Game 2).\"\nDeveloping a two-seam fastball that allows him to get more ground balls -- and rely less on overpowering hitters for strikeouts -- has been a big part of that, according to Mets manager Terry Collins .\n\"One of the things you try to do at this level is to get easy outs, try to get outs early in the count\" Collins said. \"The two-seamer has allowed him to do that. Now he has a lot more confidence to pitch to contact early in the count where he doesn't have to worry about trying to strike somebody out. I think it's been a big help to him.\"\n  Mets send Syndergaard to minor league camp National League Game Summary - New York at Chicago New York Mets' Noah Syndergaard shuts down San Diego Padres National League Game Summary - Milwaukee at New York", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:43:22.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
