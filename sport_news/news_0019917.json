Some of the tickets were valued at $135, but fans with fake ones did not get to see the historic game live.\n\"With technology, it is so easy to replicate these tickets so (fans) have to be hyper-careful,\" Green said. \"Be careful buying tickets on third party websites and buy from only reputable brokers. Just because someone says they are selling playoff tickets, doesn't mean it's authentic.\"\nInterest in the Cubs has exploded since the team defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the wild-card game. On Monday night, the team made history when six different players hit home runs against the St. Louis Cardinals, taking a 2-1 lead in the best-of-5-games series.\nBut outside Wrigley Field, dozens of fans were left reeling because of their fake tickets.\nIt is difficult to distinguish between authentic tickets and the fake ones, Green said. But official tickets have the Major Baseball League's watermark and logo scattered throughout the back. They also feature a white backdrop, not gray.\n\"It's terrible when people spend their hard-earned money and they get to the game and find they've been a victim of fraud,\" Green said. \"Fans have to be careful. Con artists are trying to take advantage of people's emotions, the desire to have a seat in the ballpark and to be there for the big games. Just because someone is selling tickets on Craigslist and you meet them at a police station, doesn't make them authentic.\"\nEmanuel, aldermen take Cubs up on face-value ticket offer Hal Dardick and Bill Ruthhart If you're an alderman or the mayor, coveted Cubs playoff tickets at face value aren't so hard to come by.\nThe team offered each of the city's 50 aldermen a pair of terrace reserved tickets on the first level under the balcony at the standard price of $64 to $74 each, team spokesman Julian Green...\nIf you're an alderman or the mayor, coveted Cubs playoff tickets at face value aren't so hard to come by.\nThe team offered each of the city's 50 aldermen a pair of terrace reserved tickets on the first level under the balcony at the standard price of $64 to $74 each, team spokesman Julian Green...\n(Hal Dardick and Bill Ruthhart) Tickets to Tuesday's afternoon Game 4 are mainly sold out, but some may be released at the box office, Green said.\n\"There may be a handful of tickets at the window that have been released by the visiting team or released internally,\" he said. \"Fans can certainly try.
