For example, the Stateliners lost five straight to Franklin from 1995-99 before running off seven straight wins against the Warriors from 2000-06. \nOverall, P’burg holds a 14-9 mark against Franklin including last Friday’s 42-6 romp at Maloney Stadium. P’burg has played Franklin more than any other team since ’95 because the teams have also met twice in the state playoffs. \nRELATED : Complete coverage: Phillipsburg football team trounces Franklin \nSome may not remember, but another team that started out as a stumbling block for P’burg was Hillsborough, the Stateliners’ opponent on Friday night. P’burg beat Hillsborough in ’95 but lost the next five meetings with the Raiders from 1996-2000. \nP’burg has since recovered nicely in its series with Hillsborough. The Stateliners won the next 11 meetings with the Raiders before last season’s 14-13 loss at Maloney Stadium, P’burg’s only setback of 2014. Overall, P’burg owns a 13-7 advantage over Hillsborough since ’95. \nP’burg, which has captured six sectional titles over that 20-year span, has dominated its recent series with North Hunterdon (16-1) with the only loss being a 14-12 setback in 1997. \nThe Stateliners have also had major success against Warren Hills (12-3) and Bridgewater (15-5). The Stateliners still have never lost to Watchung Hills since the move in '95, owning a 16-0 mark against the Warriors. \nAmongst teams its played less frequently, P’burg also has winning records against Ridge (3-1), Elizabeth (4-2), Union (5-1) and Westfield (3-0) since ’95. \nThe one team in New Jersey that’s easily given P’burg the most trouble is Hunterdon Central. The Red Devils own a 12-8 mark over the Stateliners since ’95, although P’burg has won the last two meetings and will probably be favored to win again this year when the teams meet on Oct. 23 at Maloney Stadium. \nThe P’burg-Hunterdon Central series was actually tied 6-6 before the Red Devils ran off six straight wins from 2007-12. \nWith 667 victories, P’burg continues to be the winningest football program in New Jersey. Certainly that takes longevity, and Phillipsburg has been playing football for 111 years. \nHowever, the one overriding factor is the pride, tradition and commitment to excellence that the program has sustained for more than a century.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:54:03.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
