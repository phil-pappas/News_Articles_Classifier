The Hawks have one former Gilman player on their roster, senior defensive back Malcolm Powers. \nGilman assistant coach Henry Russell said the Hawks program, which includes 10 players from the Baltimore area, is a good fit for Shanks. \n\"Shamar’s very versatile,\" Russell said. \"You can use him in the blitz game. You can use him in coverage. He’s a physical player, hardworking kid. ... College coaches ask a lot of your linebacker-type position nowadays, so Shamar fills a lot of those roles for them, being able to put pressure on the edge and also take care of guys in coverage. I think that’s what really intrigued them about Shamar.\" \nThe following Greyhounds also have committed to Division I programs: defensive tackle Ellison Jordan (Penn State); offensive linemen Devery Hamilton (Michigan), Stephen Spanellis (Virginia), Wes Mehl (Navy) and Stewart Keehner (Georgetown); cornerback Korey Stevens (Villanova); and wide receiver John Fitzgerald (Cornell).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:19:20.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
