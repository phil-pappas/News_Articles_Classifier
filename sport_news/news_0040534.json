We couldn't close it out last week but we closed it out this week and I'm proud.\" \nParker got things started for East Hall in the first quarter capping an 85-yard drive with a 21-yard strike to Jackson for a 7-0 lead. It stayed that way until the second quarter. \nWest Hall tied the game with a 53-yard touchdown run by Tyquan Statham midway through the second quarter. The Vikings answered back when Parker connected with Tripp Rider on a 15-yard scoring pass to cap 73-yard drive to take a 14-7 lead into halftime. \nThe Vikings put the game away in the second half when Jackson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run and Leo Toledo added a field goal for the final score. \n\"Our defensive line just played lights out and I could not be prouder of all those freshmen, sophomores, and juniors,\" Gray said. \"They just played their heart out.\" \nEast Hall will jump out of region play next week taking on Johnson. West Hall will play host to Franklin County trying to keep its season alive.
