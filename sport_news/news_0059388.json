(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- Redemption typically makes for a good story. When it's a year in the making ... it makes for a great one. Crane erased a year's worth of frustration Tuesday night, downing Clever 25-18 and 25-19 to win the Class 2, District 11 final and advance to the sectional round. After dropping a heartbreaker in last year's final, the Lady Pirates weren't about to let history repeat itself. Crane head coach Melody Mullins had her team focused and ready.\"We played Clever last Thursday, so we knew what they had,\" Mullins said. \"We floundered last year at districts, and we knew we were going to have to play strong. We knew they were going to be ready, but we didn't want what happened last year to happen again. We were going to do whatever it took to make sure that didn't happen.\" CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE GAME The first set seemed to echo Mullins' statement. After a shaky, back-and-forth start, Crane seized control of the early momentum. Senior standout Emma Lander uncorked a vicious kill down the line for a Crane side-out, then served three aces in a row to give the Lady Pirates an 8-5 lead and a bit of breathing room. Clever wasn't about to roll over, but the Lady Jays were unable to recover from the early deficit. While the Lady Jay front line duo of Emily Mendenhall and Taylor Menzies found repeated holes in the semifinal match against Marionville, against Crane they often found single and double blockers instead. When shots at the net did manage to get past Lander and company, Crane's back line was there to turn back the would-be kills.\"We really focus on the angles,\" Mullins said. \"We really try to scout players and figure out their tendencies and where they're going to hit, and my girls are really good at picking up on that. They're quick on their feet, they read well and they have a lot of heart.\" Lander's tip at the net gave the Lady Pirates a first-set victory and fired up the Crane student section. While the first set margin lingered between three and four points, for the most part, the second was all about runs. This time, it was Clever taking early control of the match. A four-point rally gave the Lady Jays a 10-6 lead; however, Crane answered back with a run of its own to tie the set back up at 14-14. Another Crane four-point run late in the game pushed the lead to 20-17, and then Crane slowly pulled away for good. Crane libero Shelby Roder pointed to the team's renewed focus following last year's final.\"It's been a dream for all of us since our freshman year,\" Roder said. \"We've talked about this game for a long time, and we knew that Clever was going to want to beat us on their home floor. We talked throughout the entire game, 'dream ... heart ... never give up,' and we didn't. We put everything we had out there, and we just never gave up.\" Despite the season-ending loss, the young Clever squad has much to look forward to. Coach Angie Wise pointed to her team's inspired effort.\"Last Thursday, they beat us for the conference championship and pretty much took care of business,\" Wise said. \"I just told the kids after last Thursday, 'Girls, you have nothing to lose. They're the ones with the pressure on them.' We came out ready to play. A couple things happen there and kind of turned things around, but we played hard and battled Crane ... they're a great team.\" For Crane (30-4-1), a sectional date with upset-minded Cinderella, El Dorado Springs (12-19-1), awaits on Oct. 24. The Bulldogs join a trio of 30-win teams in the section pod with Crane, Strafford (30-3-1) and Liberty (32-3).
