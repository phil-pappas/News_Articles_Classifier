They’ve already rendered the next 11 weeks meaningless based on their rotten play.\nBut with their quarterback, Matthew Stafford, their former (and maybe still) future at the position.\nLions coach Jim Caldwell benched Stafford in Sunday’s 42-17 blowout loss to the Arizona Cardinals after Stafford threw three interceptions in less than three quarters.\nCaldwell said after the game and reiterated Monday that Stafford is still his starter, but in the quarterback-driven NFL it’s rare that teams bench signal-callers they truly believe are franchise types.\nStafford has thrown an NFL-worst eight interceptions in the Lions’ 0-5 start and has 21 picks in the 22 games since Caldwell, the man who was touted as a quarterback guru when he was hired, replaced Jim Schwartz in January 2014.\n“It’s one game,” Caldwell said. “One game. And I think he’s certainly more than capable of straightening those things out.”\nBut the Lions’ decision to bench the No. 1 pick in the 2009 draft, even for the end of a humiliating loss, speaks volumes.\n“Well, one of the (reasons we benched him), to be candid with you, is the fact that anytime you have play going on like that, I certainly think that it warrants some changes,” Caldwell said. “And so that’s the one that we decided (Sunday). Today is a little different. He’s still our starting quarterback, but I’m just certainly not interested in watching those kinds of performances consistently.”\nStafford, to his credit, was accountable for his struggles Sunday, as he has been much of his career. He told reporters in the locker room after the game that he needs to be better, and he repeated that message to teammates in meetings and with his actions on Monday.\n“He was attentive. He was listening. He was speaking (in our offensive meeting),” receiver Lance Moore said. “If there was something that he felt like he messed up on, he spoke up and said, ‘My bad, that’s not a good throw.’ Or, ‘That’s not a good decision.’\n“But he’s our guy. There’s not a quarterback controversy by any means. Matt’s our guy. He’s going to be our guy. We’re going to ride with him. And we’ve got to do it together.”\nStafford has taken an inordinate amount of the blame for the Lions’ league-worst record, as often happens with quarterbacks. Much of the criticism has been deserved, but he’s also a product of the players and system around him.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nGolden Tate backtracks on criticism of Lions fans\nThe Lions have one of the worst offensive lines in the league, they haven’t run the ball with any authority, they lack a deep passing game and the locker room has shown signs of fracturing, though safety James Ihedigbo called suggestions that players are tuning out Caldwell “B.S.”\nReceiver Golden Tate did acknowledge that he needs to be more accountable on the field after his effort was called into question for the second straight game, and Tate, who had eight catches in 18 targets Sunday, said he needs to help Stafford out with his play, too.\n“The decision that Coach Caldwell made (to bench Stafford) is a decision he made,” Tate said. “Who am I to speak on that? He has his reasons. But I believe that Matt’s our guy.\n“We know that he is a heck of a quarterback and we just got to deliver. I still have a lot of confidence in Matt, and I’m excited for him to get back on the field on Sunday, because I know he’s going to have fire.”\nStafford is on pace for his worst statistical season since 2010, when he played just three games because of shoulder injuries. He ranks 33rd in the NFL in passer rating (74.8) and has as many picks as the next three quarterbacks on the Lions’ schedule — the mediocre bunch of Teddy Bridgewater, Jay Cutler and Alex Smith — combined.\nThe Lions will have to make a decision on Stafford’s future with the team at some point in the next two off-seasons, either by giving him a new eight-figure contract or letting him try to reach his still massive potential somewhere else.\nThat time is not now. But, depending on how he and the Lions play the next 11 games, it could be soon.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nSharp: Time for Ford to clean house with Lions\nUp next for Lions\nMatchup: Chicago Bears (2-3) at Lions (0-5).\nWhen: 1 p.m. Sunday.\nWhere: Ford Field.\nTV: Fox (Channel 2 in Detroit).\nLine: Lions by 3.\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.
