Official sources said that the 40-year-old ‘birs’ have been found from the house of an old woman Parkash Rani (80). Sources said that Parkash Rani’s mother used to regularly recites verses from the ‘birs’. As Parkash Rani was in the process of selling the house, a visitor noticed the books lying there. He informed the management of the local gurdwara. As soon as Ravinder Singh, Deputy Commissioner, Fazilka, received information about the birs, he, along with Additional Deputy Commissioner Charandev Singh Maan, rushed to the house of Parkash Rani. They performed ‘ardas’ and sent the ‘birs’ to the local gurdwara.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:11:22.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
