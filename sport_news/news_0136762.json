The timing is unfortunate but I have some issues that need to be dealt with at this time.\" \nCrowton, an Orem native, graduated from BYU in 1983 and was the head coach of the Cougars from 2001-04, his first and only head coaching job. He then moved on to offensive coordinator roles with Louisiana State, Maryland, and the CFL's Winnipeg Blue Bombers before landing at Southern Utah in 2014. \nThunderbird assistant offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach Justin Walterscheid will handle the vacant coordinator position moving forward. No timetable is set to find a replacement for Crowton, who informed the players and coaches in a team meeting at 2:30 p.m. Monday. \n\"He has been a greate friend and an amazing mentor for me,\" SUU coach Ed Lamb said of Crowton in a statement. I appreciate the base and philosophy he has provided for our team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:14:55.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
