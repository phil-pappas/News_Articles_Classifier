Villaruel   26, 2015 - 12:00am \nCEBU, Philippines – In one night of recollecting memories filled with fun and laughter, the Cebu Executives and Professionals Chess Association celebrated its 25th year anniversary, taking pride for being the longest existing chess organization in the country that has done so much to the Cebu sporting community. \nThe founding members of the privately-funded club led by Frank 'Boy' Pestaño and Alex Tolentino as well as its top officials headed by its dynamic president Engr. Jerry Maratas stand tall and proud as they relived and rekindled the good old days CEPCA. \nFrom less than pioneering 10 members, CEPCA has blossomed through the years, now drawing hundreds of followers from practically all kinds of profession. \nSince its inception in 1990, CEPCA has positioned itself as one of the underlying reasons why chess in Cebu continue to thrive, still alive and kicking all these years. Its unflinching support and dedicated effort to the development and propagation of the sport in this side of the archipelago has become a shining landmark in its 25 years of existence. \n‘Now, 25 years since its birth, I’m proud to say that CEPCA is still very much alive and continue to remain relevant in Cebu chess,” said Maratas. “I would like to make a special mention to Mr. Boy Pestaño, the untiring heart and soul of CEPCA. He deserves the credit of bringing CEPCA to where it is now today.” \nAnd as they marked a milestone event, it was just fitting that CEPCA paid tribute and looked back with a grateful heart to all those who laid the solid foundation of which the present disciples of this highly-respected band of chess aficionados now firmly stand.   \nGiven posthumous awards during the simple but meaningful ceremony the other night at the Social Hall of Sacred Heart Center were CEPCA founder Matias 'Bombi' Aznar III, Arturo Ynclino, Danny Ynclino and Sonny Sollano. \nAlso honored were the past presidents of the club. Aside from Boy Pestano and Tolentino, the rest include Nicnic Climaco, Manny Manzanares, Jun C. Olis, Mandy Baria, Norway Lara, Romualdo Muralla, Benjamin Dimaano, Roger Reyes, Victor Legaspina, Bobot Villaluna, and Mat Matuco. \nLongtime chess patrons Boojie Lim, Andrew Aznar, Kelly Uy and Darcy Tabotabo and Marie Ernestine School, the first learning institution to integrate chess in its curriculum, filled up the list of honorary awardees, while given special citations were FIDE Arbiter Marvin Ruelan, the New York-based Susan Itaas, the first and only Cebuana Women's National Master, Ely Bercilles, and Handuraw Pizza, the club's sanctuary in its monthly tournament. \n`Under the flagship of Maratas, the present officers of CEPCA were also recognized. They are Marvyne Guardiana, Ruel Hortelano, Jun Kidlat, Jun Olis, Boy Pestano, Nicnic Climaco, Jojo Muralla, and Harvey Jjane Hilvano. \nIn his two-year reign, Maratas highlighted some of CEPCA’s numerous accomplishments, including a relative increase in the club’s membership and the staging of many tournaments with emphasis on the grassroots level. \nAside from drafting and implementing new policies and measures to ensure the club’s sustainability, CEPCA has also fostered better camaraderie among members and has reached out to the community with more charitable activities. \n“In short, we have seen a more vibrant and dynamic club in the past two years,” said Maratas.“While CEPCA endeavors in holding quality tournaments, we are also serious in the promotion and development of chess up to the grassroots level here in Cebu.” \n“Why we are doing this? The bottom-line I believe is because we still passionately love chess even though we are now past our primes. And chess is a wonderful intellectual sport and their principles and strategies can also be used as formulas for us to become successful in our lives,” ended Maratas.
