Niersbach explained that he only learned about the deal when he visited Beckenbauer at his Austrian residence on Tuesday. \nThe money paid back through FIFA in early 2005 from the World Cup organizing committee had been earmarked for an opening gala that had been canceled, Niersbach told reporters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:35:58.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
