Chief Doug Barthel is leaving after 12 years at the helm, and 30 with the Sioux Falls Police Department. \nBeing the boss usually means you get an office to yourself, but even when he is alone, Chief Doug Barthel is surrounded. There are pictures everywhere. The law man has framed pretty much anyone and anything important to him. That includes family, politicians he has met, and his hunting trips. \n\"Well, the day after I retire is the opening day of pheasant season,\" Barthel said about his upcoming plans. \nIn August, Barthel announced his decision. Putting on the badge was not a life long goal. The idea to go into law enforcement did not strike Barthel until he was in high school. \n\"Wasn't planning on going to college, but then talked with the school counselor who said, you really can't be a police officer until you're 21. So what are you going to do in the meantime? It was at that point I decided to go to college and get a degree,\" Barthel said. \nAfter obtaining his diploma, Barthel eventually became a lieutenant who supervised the department's drug task force. Then, at a rather young age, former Sioux Falls Mayor Dave Munson appointed Barthel as the chief of police. \n\"Frankly, I think he took a risk, because I was a 40-year-old police lieutenant. That, I had about 17 years experience within the department, and had never served in an upper management leadership role and he took a chance on me,\" Barthel said. \nThat's not exactly how Munson remembers it. \n\"I didn't look at whether he was 60 years old or 40 years old, or whatever it was. I just think you look at the person that can do the job and he fit the bill of what I was looking for and I think he proved himself,\" Munson said. \nIf you ask Barthel, however, he has never been a one-man department. Barthel has nearly doubled the number of officers at the police station, which now totals more than 240 men and women. The last 12 years really has been a team effort. \n\"A lot of days I can just sit back and enjoy the ride and watch them do the work. Maybe requires a little bit of guidance once in a while, but that's the part that makes me most proud. Seeing all those different people grow in their careers,\" Barthel said. \n\"You feel like you have a say in what's happening in the the department and the direction we're going in. It isn't just one man's decision. He wants the team all involved,\" Capt. Blaine Larsen said. \nBarthel, who will soon begin a job with Sanford Health as Director of Community Relations/Public Policy, uses this all inclusive approach when it comes to outreach. A big priority has been getting officers out into the community to get to know the people they protect. \n\"Doug can relate to people very well and I think that's what made him successful,\" Munson said. \n\"A lot of people are sad to see him go,\" Larsen said. \nLooking back at his career, Chief Doug Barthel says he did not do any of it alone and will no easily take credit for any of his accomplishments as the boss. \n\"It's because of the work our officers and staff are doing. Not necessarily because of something I did,\" Barthel said. \"In our profession, it really is about the people.\" \nProof that being a true leader is about appreciating the people you surround yourself with.
