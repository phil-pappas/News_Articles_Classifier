A national committee comprised of top college basketball personnel determined the watch list of 20 candidates. \nGathers was named a second-team All-American and a first-team All-Big 12 honoree following his 2014-15 junior season. He led the Big 12 Conference and broke Baylor’s single-season rebounding record with 394 boards, and he was the only power-5 conference player to average 11-plus points and 11-plus rebounds per game. The workhorse forward has played in all 109 games during his three years at Baylor, and he started all 37 games a season ago. \nPrince was named national and Big 12 Sixth Man of the Year following a breakout junior season in 2014-15. A second-team All-Big 12 honoree, Prince led the team with 13.9 points in just 26.3 minutes per game, and he ranked third in the Big 12 with 15.6 points per game in conference play. Following the season he earned a spot on Team USA for the 2015 Pan American Games, where he started every game and helped the team to a bronze medal. \nBy mid-February, the watch list of 20 players for the 2016 Karl Malone Power Forward of the Year Award will be narrowed to just 10. In March, five finalists will be presented to Mr. Malone and the Hall of Fame’s selection committee. The winner of the 2016 Karl Malone Award will be presented at the ESPN College Basketball Awards presented by Wendy’s from Club Nokia in Los Angeles, CA on Friday, April 8, 2016. Broadcast information will be released at a later date. \nFor more information on the 2016 Karl Malone Award, log onto www.HoophallAwards.com . \nThe Bears open the 2015-16 season on Nov. 13 when they host Stephen F. Austin at the Ferrell Center. That game will tip off at 8:30 p.m. CT and will air on FOX Sports Southwest-Plus.
