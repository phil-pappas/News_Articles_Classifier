Talking to The Tribune on the phone, Gujral said the country had done well at the foreign policy level and to improve the economy under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, due to controversial statements made by certain ruling party MPs, the work done by the Prime Minister on the development front had been eclipsed. There was a visible change in the economy of the country due to a number of steps taken by PM Modi. The country’s image had improved a lot at the international level. The country was emerging as a super power. However, irresponsible statements by some individuals diverted the attention of the people from the accomplishments to the issues that were not connected with the development of the country. Under Modi, the NDA won the elections by promising a big transformation in the economy of the country and reforms in various sectors, he said. However, because of the controversial statements, which obviously created disquiet among the minorities, the people’s focus had been diverted from the development works done by the Modi government. BJP president Amit Shah today summoned Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and some other leaders, including Sakshi Maharaj and Mahesh Sharma, to reportedly convey PM’s displeasure over their controversial statements regarding a particular minority and beef. Gujral admitted that the controversial statements being made by certain ruling party MPs were also adversely affecting BJP allies. Gujral is the first SAD leader to comment on the issue. All other senior leaders of the SAD had maintained silence on the controversial statements made by some BJP leaders. When asked why the Akali Dal took so much time to react on the controversial statements, Gujral said he was abroad and had returned only a few days ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:15:00.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
