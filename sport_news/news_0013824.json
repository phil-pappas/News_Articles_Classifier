And on this day, at least, the Sounders have no scoreboards to watch but their own. And the same is true for their host, the Houston Dynamo. \nRegardless of other results, the Sounders qualify for their seventh consecutive postseason if they win. Meanwhile, the Dynamo is eliminated with a loss or a tie. \n“We know it’s a playoff game for us as well,” coach Sigi Schmid said Saturday. “We’d rather lock up our getting into the playoff now rather than waiting another week.” \nThe Western Conference is so tightly packed that several results play out as neither clearly good news nor bad. That was the case with the Quakes-SKC match that opened this MLS weekend. A Kansas City win would have eliminated San Jose and clinched the playoffs for Seattle. But that loss left SKC a stationary target at 48 points, just one ahead of Seattle for fourth place. Second and third places also remain mathematically in reach. \n“It’s unbelievably tight this year,” Schmid said. “… It’s what the league wants – parity—they have parity. They have a lot of it. We said at the beginning of the year we thought the West was going to be tighter than the East, which has proven itself out. You just have a lot of good teams.” \nThe Sounders conclude their regular season Oct. 25, meeting Real Salt Lake at fully opened CenturyLink Field. Whether the two remaining matches produce zero, one, two, four or six points will determine whether Seattle gets a first-round bye, home-field advantage for the knockout game, travels for the knockout game, or misses the playoffs for the first time in club history. \n“We’re fighting essentially relegation in my mind, with that red line,” captain Brad Evans said. “Not necessarily dropping down to another league, but saving ourselves the embarrassment of watching other teams in the playoffs, watching them from the outside in.” \nWith so many implications from so many results around the league, Schmid didn’t spend much time on whether the San Jose-Kansas City result was the best one for his club. \n“There’s nothing we can do to change other results,” he said. “It gives us a unique opportunity to try to push ourselves up into a third- or fourth-place situation – possibly even a second depending on how things go. We’d definitely like to do that.” \nThere were at least two encouraging signs for the Sounders as they trained in Houston on Saturday afternoon. \nOne was the presence of central defender Chad Marshall, who missed one game with a neck sprain, but appears return to return. \nThe other was the weather. The temperature was in the low 80s, but the humidity was in the high 20s, and there was a light breeze sweeping across the Dynamo training facility. Similar weather is expected for Sunday, and that’s about as good as it gets on a trip to Houston. \nAnd it’s an upgrade from the sweltering one-two punch of heat and humidity that several Sounders said wilted them down the stretch on their 1-1 draw. \n“In Kansas it was hot and humid,” midfielder Marco Pappa said. “Houston can be the same. At the end of the day, the mentality how we go in there how we perform the game during the 90 minutes. I hope we can have a good game in Houston. You know how important can be those points for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:23:48.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
