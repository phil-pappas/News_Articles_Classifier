Missed playoffs. \nCOACH: Gerard Gallant (second season, fifth NHL season). \nADDED: LW Martin Havlat. \nLOST: RW Scottie Upshall, RW Brad Boyes, RW Tomas Kopecky, G Dan Ellis. \nPLAYER TO WATCH: LW Jonathan Huberdeau. Put on a line with Jaromir Jagr toward the end of last season and Huberdeau was good as ever, averaging a point per game. If he has that pace over a full season, Florida could have one of the elite first-lines in the NHL. \nOUTLOOK: They’ll need Jagr to be good, G Roberto Luongo to remain good and can’t afford any letdowns from their defensemen corps. But on paper, this looks like as good a team Florida has had in the better part of two decades. A strong start to the season might be crucial, especially since there’s no shortage of contenders in the Eastern Conference, but playoffs are hardly out of the question.
