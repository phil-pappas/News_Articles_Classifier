The only other team in all of Division I with a better record than the Panthers is the only team to defeat them, the Cape Henlopen Vikings who also sit at 12-1 on the year. Since their one and only loss on the year to Cape Henlopen, Polytech has been on a roll winning eight straight. They've earned character wins over Smyrna, Lake Forest, Sussex Tech, Milford, and Laurel over that stretch. The Panthers have scored 55 goals on the year, which second in the state behind Cape Henlopen. Meanwhile, the defense has allowed 13 goals to opponents on the season but has allowed only a goal a game on average during their current winning streak. Thursday afternoon, they’ll take on a Sussex Central team that’s won three of their last four sitting at 6-4-1 on the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:12:12.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
