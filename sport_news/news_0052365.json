But as the festival grew, marketing types rebranded that time of year as the \"shoulder season.\"\nNow, the four-day festival — with paddling, slacklining, running, climbing and bike events — ranks as one of Vail's busiest weekends, with tens of thousands of visitors packing the valley and setting the pace for the warm-weather tourism season.\nAdvertisement \"We are looking to duplicate that business model in the early-winter season,\" said Mike Imhof, the chief of the Vail Valley Foundation, which owns the Mountain Games. \"We have an opportunity here, during a flexible time of year in our community, to create an event that offers culture, nightlife, sport and business networking opportunities.\"\nThe festival debut will be a soft launch — with events only at Beaver Creek.\nThe foundation will then gather community thoughts on how the festival could grow valleywide, perhaps spanning eight to 10 days from the end of Thanksgiving through the Birds of Prey races, Imhof said.\nThis year, the foundation will install its largest-ever grandstands — free to the public — at the finish of the menacing Birds of Prey race course. A new VIP and \"club-level\" ticket, priced at $120 and available to everyone, will provide access previously reserved for racing insiders.\nThe foundation also is peddling the idea that ski industry leaders — retail and gear executives, foundations and legislators — can use the festival as a gathering point for meetings, Imhof said.\nThe Vail Valley Foundation's new festival plan includes integrating some of the beloved events of the American Ski Classic, including the celebrity and ski legend races under the lights at Vail Mountain and the international ski hall of fame ceremony.\nThe American Ski Classic, which began as the Ford Cup in 1982, was canceled last year to avoid overlap with the 2015 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships in February.\nThe hope is that the larger, Olympics-like festival will foster the same everyman appeal of the ski classic as well as the energy of the world ski championships.\n\"At the 2015 world championships, we saw a huge wave of enthusiasm and passion for ski racing and alpine sports with a festive atmosphere surrounding the celebration of top athletes,\" U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association president Tiger Shaw said in a statement.\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or @jasonblevins", "external_links": ["http://www.vvf.org/athletics/americas-winter-opening.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:06:51.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
