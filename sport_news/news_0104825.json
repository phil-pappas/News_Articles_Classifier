He was the Western Hockey League's defenseman of the year last season for Seattle. \nThe 27-year-old Holzer was scoreless in two games for San Diego. Acquired from Toronto in March, he has two points and seven assists in 58 career NHL games — all with the Maple Leafs. \nDespres was injured Friday night in the Ducks' 3-0 home loss to Colorado. He appeared to get hit in the head on a check by Tyson Barrie. Stoner was scratched against the Avalanche because of a lower-body injury. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:12:17.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
