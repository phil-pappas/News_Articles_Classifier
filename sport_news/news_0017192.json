It's just a wreck. Coach Paul Johnson wasn't wrong when he said his team has scored more points against ACC rivals Duke, North Carolina and Clemson than anyone else. But that's small consolation for Georgia Tech, the defending ACC Coastal Division champion and loser of four consecutive games heading into Saturday's meeting against Pitt at Bobby Dodd Stadium. Injuries and a difficult schedule have stood in the way of progress, but Johnson gets more to the point, blaming ineptitude and confusion. He also mentions that his team “has issues,” a scathing indictment seven weeks into the season. “I've never experienced anything like this in my (19-year) coaching career, being as inept as we are on offense,” he said after Georgia Tech ran for only 71 yards against No. 6 Clemson. That rushing total is a low for Georgia Tech during Johnson's eight years there. It started with a 30-22 loss at Notre Dame, a game billed as a clash between two of the more promising teams in the country. A preseason media poll pegged Georgia Tech for the Coastal Division title and a second consecutive trip to the ACC championship game. “I really thought Georgia Tech was going to be up there battling Duke,” said play-by-play veteran Tim Brant, who will call the game for the ACC Network. What followed were decent offensive performances but losses nonetheless to Duke (34-20), North Carolina (38-31) and Clemson (43-24). “(The defenses) all line up the same way. I don't know how you could be confused,” Johnson said. “When you line up and you are trying to run an option play, and the kids can't tell the difference between a 50 defense or a 4-3 or a 6-1, you've got issues. I mean, if you can't look and see if the guards are covered or uncovered, you've got issues.”Johnson's triple-option offense is difficult for some defenses to decipher, but it also requires precision blocking and backs with experience and vision. Despite returning four offensive linemen and quarterback Justin Thomas, Georgia Tech lacks experienced running backs. Eight of the top nine backs from last season graduated or were kicked off the team. Former Georgia Tech running back Roddy Jones, who will be the sideline reporter the ACC Network, knows how tough the offense can be for young players. “I'm sure I blew a ton of assignments (as a freshman). I'm sure that's what's going on,” said Jones, a four-year starter who eventually grew up to rush for 214 yards against Georgia in 2008. Several backs have be Jones declined to predict a winner, but he didn' “It's going to be tough for Georgia Tech to move the ball,” he said. “I got a chance to see Pitt' Notes: Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has listed outside linebacker Nicholas Grigsby (neck) as questionable on his weekly injury report. Grigsby was injured on the first play of the Virginia game and did not return. Narduzzi said at the time Grigsby could have played, if necessary.
