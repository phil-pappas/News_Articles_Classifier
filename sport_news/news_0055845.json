On Saturday, the Elmira Express nearly delivered the offensive equivalent of a perfect game, scoring touchdowns on all but two possessions en route to a 55-14 dismantling of the Corning Hawks. Elmira (6-0, 3-0) not only avenged a loss to Corning (4-2, 2-1) in last year’s sectional championship game, but clinched the No. 1 seed in the Section IV, Class AA playoffs. “Obviously the better team today won,” Corning head coach George Bacalles said. “They came right out and executed from the get-go on offense, defense and special teams. I thought Elmira played phenomenal. I give our kids credit for the effort. We had a couple drives and then we had a couple penalties that stalled drives. We’ve got to get better than that and look at film and get ready for Binghamton next week.” The senior running back duo of Dashaun Sutton and Allaah Sessions combined for a staggering 366 yards from scrimmage and five touchdowns as the Express found the end zone on seven of nine offensive possessions for the game. The Express turned the ball over once on a fumble and with less than a minute to go in the game, punted the ball away on fourth-and-5. Other than those two instances, every other Elmira possession resulted in a touchdown. “Our goal is to score every time we get the ball and our goal on defense is to stop them every time they get the ball,” Elmira head coach Jimmy McCauley said. “Does it happen every time? No, but we put a lot of pressure on our kids to make sure that it happens more in our favor. The kids do a great job of buying in. They do a great job of playing, hustling and giving a team effort.” Sutton and Sessions set the tone and quickly helped the Express establish a commanding lead, running behind an offensive line that consistently cleared open massive running lanes. The first quarter belonged to Sutton, who finished the game with 202 yards rushing and three touchdowns on just 10 carries, while also hauling in a 20-yard touchdown pass. On the game’s second play from scrimmage, Sutton found a gaping hole on the right side and ran 42 yards virtually untouched to the end zone. On Elmira’s second possession, the Express needed four plays to cash in as quarterback Anthony Aumick connected with Sutton on a 20-yard scoring strike. That possession was set up after Sutton picked off a John Dobson pass and returned in 22 yards. Page 2 of 3 - Elmira opened up a 22-0 lead in the final minute of the first quarter when Sutton sprinted untouched on an 84-yard touchdown run. Aside from his four TDs, Sutton also added three two-point conversions. On the first play of the second quarter, Sessions upped Elmira’s lead to 24-0 when he tackled a Corning ball carrier in the end zone for a safety. On the ensuing possession, Sessions made a Corning defender miss before taking off on a 52-yard touchdown run, capping a two-play scoring drive. Sessions amassed 144 yards rushing and one touchdown on seven carries. Elmira generated 487 yards from scrimmage. “For the double wing to work, you have to have a combination of a really good offensive line and running backs who can run with it,” Bacalles said. “Their offensive line did a great job and we knew that was one of the strengths of their team and they’ve done a great job of putting together seven guys up front who are able to wall down, kick out, pull and everything and that’s a credit to their staff.” Corning’s lone defensive highlight for the game came one play after its best offensive series of the first half stalled on downs at the Elmira 31. Corning senior Nicholas Cavallaro sacked Elmira quarterback Anthony Aumick and forced a fumble that Isaiah Fisher recovered at the Express 22. But with great field position, the Hawks went backwards and punted after being faced with a fourth-and-25. “That front seven, it’s nice when they can stop the run,” McCauley said of his team’s defensive effort. “It makes it a lot easier on us, it makes it a lot easier on the d-backs, so it’s kind of what we preach as far as stopping the run.” Entering the game, Corning head coach George Bacalles talked about the importance of his team limiting Elmira’s quick-score rushing attack. Unfortunately for the Hawks, Elmira cashed in on three two-play scoring drives and a four-play march in the first half. “They’re a run-based team that’s able to explode for big plays and we couldn’t stop them from doing that and that’s something that needs to be fixed,” Bacalles said. “I’ll take this one, it’s my responsibility and I obviously didn’t do a good enough job making sure we did that and we’ve just got to turn around and get ready for a very good Binghamton team next week.” Corning finally got on the scoreboard on Devon Sullivan’s nine-yard touchdown with :45.6 seconds left in the third quarter. Sullivan added a two-yard TD run in the fourth quarter and finished with 89 yards rushing on 19 carries. Sullivan also caught one pass for 15 yards. Corning’s Ali Muhammad rushed for 76 yards on 13 carries. Page 3 of 3 - After the Hawks’ second touchdown, Dobson connected with Mike Rossi for the two-point conversion. Corning will play at Binghamton at 7 p.m. Friday in a game that could very well be for the No. 2 seed in the Section IV, Class AA playoffs.
