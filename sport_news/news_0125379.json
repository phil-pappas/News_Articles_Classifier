Show me the joy, I'll wear the lampshade. \nBut geez. There is this idea of time and place. And our oh-so-happy baseball players, complete with the oversized goggles, the soggy cigars and the puss-fulls of alcohol, seem not to have a clue. \n(Note: In a national pastime that features spitting, scratching and swearing, that allows chewing tobacco in the work place, that signs off on TV commercials hawking a particular product that allows a hopeful fella to get and keep a very specific demonstration of endearment … well, in light of all that, perhaps fretting about the message to our unsullied children that the real fun begins only when the booze gets squirted amounts to a waste of perfectly good angst.) \nBut I digress. \nWhat's up with these baseball guys, the ones in knickers who might toast the delivery of their laundry for all we know? They win and they frolic. They win and they romp. They win and they turn their clubhouses into carnivals. And their peers in all those other sports — football, basketball, hockey, who wait to celebrate until end of their championship (and far more arduous) journeys — must shake their heads. \nClinch a playoff spot … party. Triumph in a wild-card game … party. Survive the best-of-five LDS … party. Advance to the LCS … party. Claim that World Series trophy … party. \nThese people don't just smile and shake hands and maybe even go the man-hug route, mind you. No, at every stop along the line, they act as if they'd just stepped onto a Bourbon Street balcony with beads in hand. \nYou saw it two nights ago in Yankee Stadium where the Houston Astros behaved as if they'd turned back real zombies rather than just the Yankees, who'd only played like the undead. And you saw more of the same on Wednesday evening in Pittsburgh where the Chicago Cubs' response to Jake Arrieta's latest bit of pitching brilliance (i.e., the befuddling of the poor Pirates) had the whiff of Lindbergh landing in Paris to it. \nAnd, folks, you're going to get the spraying and slurping and swigging five more times — ALDS, NLDS, ALCS, NLCS, World Series — between now and early next month. So, prepare yourselves for the redundancy. Prepare yourselves for the sights and sounds of men in full-blown bay-at-the-moon mode. \nAnd even if you have his number, don't call Pitbull to add to the amusement. These are baseball players, remember. He couldn't keep up. \nContact Bud Poliquin anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-416-2021 \n(Bud also can be heard weekday mornings between 10-12 on the \"Bud & the Manchild\" sports-talk radio show on The Score-1260.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:56:17.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
