(Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images/AFP) CHICAGO - \nThe Chicago Bulls find themselves in a familiar spot, waiting for Derrick Rose to return from surgery. \nThis time it is his left eye socket on the mend and not one of his troublesome knees. And his time away should be much shorter. \nRose had surgery to repair a left orbital fracture Wednesday, one day after he was elbowed in the face by one of his teammates during practice. \nCoach Fred Hoiberg said the operation at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago “went as expected” and the team said Rose should be able to resume “basketball activities” in two weeks -- about two weeks before the Oct. 27 opener against Cleveland, \n“It’s unfortunate that he won’t be able to be a part of most of training camp and preseason,” Pau Gasol said. “It’s useful time for any team, to get teams on track, set the foundation for the new season -- especially with a new philosophy, new coach.” \nHoiberg said Rose will be able to attend practices and run, and he should be able to pick up the offence under his new coach simply by observing. \n“We don’t know how much he’ll be able to do even while he’s in recovery mode, but he still will be here, learning,” Hoiberg said. “So we’ll go as expected as far as putting our stuff in. We added a few new actions today and guys seemed to be picking things up well.” \nHoiberg said the 2011 NBA MVP was injured after making a “great baseline drive” and passing to the corner during Tuesday’s practice. \nDr. Christine Nelson, an eye specialist and professor with the University of Michigan Health System who is not handling Rose’s case, said she often recommends up to six weeks off, especially for patients whose activities put them at risk for another eye injury. But she said athletes eager to return to play could probably do so safely in less time by wearing a face mask or goggles. \nThe last thing the Bulls needed was their star point guard going down on the first day of practice. \nThe Bulls return virtually intact after winning 50 games and losing to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Management did make a big change on the sideline by replacing hard-driving, defensive-oriented coach Tom Thibodeau with Hoiberg. \nThey believe Hoiberg will do a better job distributing minutes and easing the load, which in turn will result in a fresher team in the playoffs. \nA big key, of course, is Rose’s health. \nHe missed all of the 2012-13 season after tearing his left ACL during the first round of the 2012 playoffs, and played only 10 games two years ago after tearing the meniscus in his right knee. He also had a minor procedure on the right knee late last season, and the same old questions continue to hover over him. \nCan he stay healthy? And can he consistently perform at an elite level? \n“This team’s in good spirits,” Joakim Noah said. “Things like that happen. It’s not the end of the world, and I know he’s gonna come in and help lead this team.” \nHoiberg said Rose was “still in great spirits” when they spoke Tuesday night. \n“He had a really good day going until he caught an unfortunate elbow,” Hoiberg said. “He’s still in a great place. It’s just getting through this.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:37:15.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
