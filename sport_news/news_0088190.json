That gave the speedy Cain, running full speed the entire way and being waved home by third base coach Mike Jirschele, enough time to beat the relay throw from second base with a textbook slide that ignited a sellout crowd.\nIt was up to Davis, who got the Royals out of a jam in the eighth, to finish it off.\nDavis gave up a single to Russell Martin and walked Kevin Pillar before striking out pinch-hitter Dioner Navarro. After stolen bases put runners on second and third, Davis struck out Ben Revere, then got Donaldson on a bouncer to third.\nKansas City shortstop Alcides Escobar was voted the ALCS MVP after going 11 for 23 (.478). And for the fifth time in two years, the Royals clinched a postseason series at home.\nBen Zobrist and Mike Moustakas homered, and Alex Rios also drove in a run for Kansas City, which ended an embarrassing 29-year postseason drought just last season.\nThe Royals eventually swept their way to the World Series, where they succumbed to the San Francisco Giants in Game 7 with the tying run standing 90 feet away.\nKansas City will try to do one win better against the Mets.\nFor the Blue Jays, it was a frustrating ending to a late-season surge that ended their own postseason drought dating to 1993. They had rallied from a 2-0 series deficit against Texas in the divisional round, then staved off elimination against the Royals in Game 5 in Toronto.\nThey simply couldn't win their sixth straight elimination game.\nThe Royals wasted no time taking the lead off David Price, the Blue Jays ace who has been so good during the regular season but remains winless in eight career postseason starts.\nZobrist pounced on the tall left-hander in the first inning, pulling a 1-1 pitch down the left-field line. Zobrist's homer gave Kansas City the lead and sent a capacity crowd of 40,494 into a towel-waving frenzy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:59:10.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
