One metric says yes (for now) Comments Gene J. Puskar \nQB sacks, like this one by Troy Reeder against Army last week, are a key to the Penn State formula. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) \nPenn State is the 20th-ranked team in the country according to S&P+ , an advanced metric developed by Bill Connelly, who writes the Football Study Hall blog for SB Nation . \nThat’s ahead of, among many others, Ohio State, Northwestern, Michigan State, TCU and Temple, which beat the Nittany Lions 27-10 five weeks ago. \nI’ll stop here a moment to left the laughter die down. \nConnelly himself urged caution, by phone from Missouri Thursday. \n“Honestly, right now, from about No. 18 to 45 there’s not a big gap,’’ he said. “It appears that right now in college football, there’s a bigger gap (than usual) between really good defenses and really bad ones, and Penn State certainly has a top defense.’’ \nConnelly’s system derives from the play-by-play and drive data of all 800-plus games, and 140,000-plus plays, of an FBS season. \nIt combined ranks in what Connelly considers the Five Factors of college football: efficiency, explosiveness, field position, finishing drives and turnovers. \nAccording to Connelly, who originally developed S&P+ for the excellent Football Outsiders web site, teams that win the efficiency “battle,’’ in a game win the game 83 percent of the time. \nPercentages for the other four Factors: explosiveness, 86 percent; finishing drives, 75 percent; field position, 72 percent; and turnover margin, 73 percent. \nYes, everything about S&P+ is opponent-adjusted, so the Lions’ rank is not particularly, or at least entirely, a function of the soft schedule they’ve played so far. \nAnd, yes, Connelly’s system is weighted toward the end of the season, so it’ll be tough for the Lions to sustain its rank unless, of course, it can beat the Buckeyes and Spartans and Wildcats. \nStill, the rank raises a question. Penn State’s team is an amalgam of extreme strengths and weaknesses - horrid offensive line, superb defensive line, an excellent, aggressive defense, some speedy playmakers, bad punting, etc. \nCoach James Franklin insists - he’s said this a lot lately - that his approach to game-planning and play-calling is a deliberate attempt to mitigate the strengths and weaknesses: Accept that you don’t have an efficient, chains-moving offense. Create turnovers and don’t commit them, tilt the field, win the field position game, and hit a big play once in a while. \nDo the five factors indicate Franklin is on to something? \nEfficiency: Defined as “consistency in staying on schedule and putting yourself in position to move the chains,’’ this metric rates every offensive play compared to an average standard for the down-and-distance, field position, score at the time and time on the clock. \nConnelly calls this the football equivalent of on-base percentage. \nUnsurprisingly, Penn State’s offense has been horrible here, 125th of 128 FBS teams. The Lions’ defense ranks 27th. \nExplosiveness: If Efficiency ranks play-by-play success, Explosiveness ranks degree of success. Think slugging percentage. \nPenn State’s offense is eighth in the country, the defense 20th. \nSay what you want about the Lions’ offense, but they’ve had 30 plays of 20 yards or more, 21 or 30 yards or more, 10 of 40 or more and four of 50 or more (this includes special teams). \n“They may not consistently make plays, but the ones they’ve made have been enormous,’’ Connelly said. \nField Position: This is simply the average starting field position for a team and its opponents. Penn State’s average drive has started at the 37 yard-line, second-best in the country. Its opponents’ drives have started at the 28 (46th). \n“That nine-yard gap,’’ Connelly said, “is huge.’’ \nFinishing drives: This is points per possession inside the opponents’ 40-yard line. \nThis seems like an area where there’s room for improvement. The Lions have been surprisingly bad here on both sides of the ball, 99th on offense and 107th on defense. \nTurnover margin: Connelly doesn’t measure this - other than to simply count turnovers - but he does attempt to allow for its inherent flukiness. \nPenn State is second in the country in sacks, which tend to increase both fumbles and interceptions, indicating that its turnover margin is relatively non-fluky. \nTo summarize then, through five 2015 games, Penn State’s offense has been horrendously dysfunctional in terms of points, yardage and efficiency. It’s ability to play defense, take care of and take away the ball, win the field-position game and hit big plays has done a surprisingly good job of making up for it. \nThat’s really Franklin’s story, and he’s probably sticking with it. \nBut the margin for error is about to get smaller. Except for Indiana (55th) and the dumpster fire in Maryland (83rd), every team left on the schedule ranks 34th or better in S&P+. \nAdjusting for home-field advantage, Connelly has Penn State losing to Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State and Northwestern , and finishing 7-5.
