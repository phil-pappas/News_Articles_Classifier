But she describes spending time with Kemble as life-changing.\n\"Elizabeth was one of those people that you meet once in a lifetime, those people who are truly selfless and caring and who love everyone for who they are with no judgment.\"\nOn Monday at 8 a.m., Kemble was crossing East Burnside Street in a marked crosswalk at the intersection with Southeast 181st Avenue, less than a block from the Meals on Wheels center and less than a mile from home.\nShe was struck by a 2008 Toyota Prius driven by Jacob M. Walters, 27, of Northeast Portland. The collision sent her flying 35 feet and broke major bones , including her back, her pelvis, a leg and an arm. She died less than 12 hours later at Oregon Health & Science University.\nWalters admitted to police after the crash that, only moments before impact, he had been smoking marijuana from a pipe while driving, court documents say. He remained at the scene and cooperated with police. He told a deputy he felt a little high from smoking the drug, the affidavit says.\nKembel's is the highest-profile death associated with cannabis since recreational marijuana became legal for adults in Oregon last week. Police said Tuesday it was unclear to what extent marijuana impairment had been a factor in the crash.\nKemble was born in El Salvador, Wilcke said. Her mother, who adored her, decided her kidney problems were serious enough that she should leave her family at a young age to live with her grandmother in the U.S., with its superior health care.\nShe underwent a first kidney transplant in her late teens or early 20s, Wilcke. When that transplanted kidney began to fail, Kemble's mother donated one of hers. That kidney functioned for many, many years, Wilcke said. Kemble underwent a third transplant in March and was still recovering, under doctors orders to get out and walk to promote her health, Wilcke said.\nKemble's suffering, during her years of dialysis and in recovering from transplant surgery, gave her terrific empathy for others with health struggles, especially those who need dialysis, Wilcke said. She befriended all the other patients undergoing dialysis as well as the nurses and technicians at the clinic.\nEven when her transplants meant she no longer needed dialysis, she worked with kidney advocacy groups, making the case for kidney donation and kidney care and coaching individuals new to kidney failure through the stages of what to expect and how to stay cheerful.\n\"She was so open in sharing of herself and so able to help people think, 'You need to look past what your diagnosis is and look to who you are as a person,'\" Wilkie said.\nAt the Meals on Wheels center, where about 100 Rockwood-area seniors gather daily for a communal free meal, Kemble, as volunteer greeter, \"was the first person people saw when they came through the door,\" Chowning said. \"She had this radiance about her.\"\nIn the 1990s, when they were students at Portland Community College, she met Don Kemble. They were married for more than 21 years and she adored him, Wilkie and others said. They recently adopted a dog, Junior.\nKemble's Facebook page is a study in appreciating life and beauty. She photographed trees, flowers, Junior and the Columbia River Gorge and posted Quote: s from famous people such as \"Just to be is a blessing. Just to live is holy.\"\nThere is no snark; there are no complaints. Gratitude, love and peace are all that emanate.\nOn an online support page for kidney patients, Quote: : \"My advice to others who are starting dialysis is take one day at the time, get plenty of rest, watch your fluids and food intake. Being on dialysis has taught me to see that life is PRECIOUS, FRAGILE and WORTH LIVING. I been living with end stage renal disease for the past 31 years. I am thankful to have available this treatment that gives me the opportunity to keep alive so I can spend time with my family.\"\nIn another post, Quote: : \"I love my life and I live it to the fullest of my ability. I feel lucky to still be here to talk about my experiences. My family is important to me, especially my husband of 21 years, my mother who donated a kidney to me, and my brother and sister. I don't take anything for granted, treat others as I would want to be treated, and always look for the positive side â€“ even when that is not so easy to find.\"\n-- Betsy Hammond\nbetsyhammond@oregonian.com", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/strawberryshark", "http://www.mealsonwheelspeople.org/what-we-do/dining-centers/rockwood-center/", "http://www.rideconnection.org/Ride/AboutUs.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:50:18.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
