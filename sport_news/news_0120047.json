Hong Brothel visit gets retraced 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Las Vegas\nAuthorities are retracing Lamar Odom's $75,000 visit to the brothel where he was found unconscious as the former NBA and reality TV star remains hospitalized and the Kardashian team spars with the brothel's owner over media attention surrounding the ordeal.\nThere's been no official word on Odom's condition, but the Rev. Jesse Jackson visited him Wednesday and said he's on life support.\nOdom's grandmother, Florence Odom , declined to comment on his status Thursday, saying she was becoming distressed at unfounded speculation that her grandson would be taken off life support. His father, Joe Odom, also declined to discuss his condition, saying that information was confidential.\nNye County law enforcement and brothel officials said Odom's incident was a rarity for the Love Ranch, in the rural community of Crystal, and have summed it up as a possible drug-related medical episode.\n\"We're going to be looking at the entire situation, how he actually came to be where he is now,\" Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said at a Wednesday news conference.\nOdom was found unconscious at the brothel Tuesday with white and reddish substances coming from his nose and mouth. His breathing was consistent, but he seemed to be in a deep sleep-like state, said Richard Hunter , a Love Ranch spokesman and one of the people who called 911.\nHe was to be flown by helicopter about 80 miles to Las Vegas, but he had to be taken by ambulance because he couldn't fit in the aircraft.\nOdom's estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian , rushed to his side at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center . Since then, friends, teammates and loved ones have visited and posted requests for prayers on social media.\nAuthorities have taken a blood sample to find out if Odom overdosed on drugs or alcohol, but the results could take several weeks.\nThe Kardashian team and Love Ranch owner Dennis Hof also locked horns over media attention while about a dozen reporters and camera crews staked out the hospital.\nKhloe Kardashian's representatives reached out Wednesday to Hof and asked him not to speak to the press.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/76/8798094/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/76/8798094/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:01:46.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
