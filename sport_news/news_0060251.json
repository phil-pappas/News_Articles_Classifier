More tags were also issued.\nHunting guide Dave Lesniak with Coweta County Gator Getters has been hunting gators since the state legalized the sport in 2003. But as the popularity has increased, so has the difficulty.\n\"They're a million year old animal. They've adapted to being hunted,\" he said. \"When I first started doing this, you could ride right up on them. But not anymore.\"\nLesniak has had success this season on Lake Seminole. Out of 10 guided hunts, 8 have been successful.\nAlready this season two 12-foot plus gators were taken on Lake Seminole. It's also home to the state record 13 foot 10 inch alligators that was taken in 2013.\nHunters must abide by regulations. They're limited to snares, snatch hooks, harpoons, arrows and gigs to capture gators.\nSize limitations are in place and hunters receive one tag to harvest a catch in one of the state 10 designated hunting zones.\n\"Last year the success rate was only 29 percent,\" Lezniak said.\nBut he says that's what makes the sport even more exciting. It's man vs. beast in a game of wits.\nCopyright 2015 WALB .
