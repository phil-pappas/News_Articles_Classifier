Shea/Getty Images Alabama coach Nick Saban says Texas A&M fans at Kyle Field influence the game. Nick Saban thinks Alabama fans should make Bryant-Denny Stadium more like Texas A&M’s Kyle Field.\nAdChoices Saban made the remarks on his radio show Thursday, complimenting the Aggies fans on the atmosphere they created, and suggesting that Alabama fans take notes.\n“You talk about loud. You talk about affecting the game,” Saban said, according to the Austin American Statesman . “I mean, their fans really did affect the game, and it says a lot about our players to keep their poise and focus.”\n“You know, this is the first place we’ve played for a long, long time, that we never got booed when we came out,” Saban continued. “First place. I’m telling ya. It’s a really nice facility. They had 105,000 people. And they cheered their tail off for their team. And they made it hard for us to play. I hope our fans can hear this, because this is the kind of place we should be.”\nIt’s almost certainly easier for Saban to say this considering his team scored three times on interception returns and won handily, 41-23. Still, it’s interesting to hear Saban speak so favorably of an opposing environment, even going as far to say the Crimson Tide fans should be more like them. The reaction of Alabama fans should be interesting.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://collegesports.blog.statesman.com/2015/10/23/nick-saban-wants-alabamas-stadium-to-be-more-like-kyle-field/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:39:02.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
