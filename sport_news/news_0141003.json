Although he gave away only 58 runs in 34 overs, there was nothing in his bowling that would have troubled the batsmen.\nPacer Parvinder Awana, who has been Delhi's best bet for taking wickets on placid pitches was given only 11 overs in the innings. Pawan Suyal (2/23) bowled well in his 18 overs but the rest of the attack didn't have the required sting to trouble the batsmen.\nBrief Scores: Delhi 138 & 437/9 drew with Rajasthan 240 & (target 336) 186/3 (Vineet Saxena 80*, Puneet Yadav 75*)\nPoints: Delhi 3, Rajasthan 1.
