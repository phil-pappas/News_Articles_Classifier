Kane's score handed Piedmont a 1-0 advantage with under 20 minutes to play, but it was a Cristian Alegria score just seconds later that sealed the deal as he found the back of the net to double the lead for the 2-0 win. \nSenior goalkeeper Kenneth Hearn picked up the clean sheet in goal on Senior Day as he was honored with three of his classmates just prior to kickoff.
