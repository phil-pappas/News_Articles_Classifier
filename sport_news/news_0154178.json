This is a very quiet, peaceful, wonderful community to live in.\"\nClasses had only just begun, but the school will remain closed until at least Monday.\nIn the meantime, the American Red Cross has sent and is recruiting mental health workers to respond to Roseburg, a spokeswoman for the organization said.\nWendy Weikum, a nine-year college board member, said the school community is very close.\n\"My heart goes out to all of those who experienced some loss and those who were injured also,\" she said.\nSoon after the shooting, Weikum got a call from a student.\n\"She was very shaken up,\" Weikum said.\nThe student told Weikum she had been in the classroom next to where the shooting happened. She had called Weikum to let her know that she wouldn't be able to make her piano lesson tonight.\n\"I didn't ask any specifics,\" Weikum said. \"She just said she heard it.\"\nVanessa Becker, another board member, said the board would try to figure out how to lend support for those affected.\n\"It's a tragedy â€“ I'm speechless,\" Becker said by phone. \"It's just really sad, and we're really concerned about our students and our staff and our community.\"\nUmpqua Community College, located about three hours south of Portland, has a student body of almost 5,000 students, most part time. The school sits six miles outside the timber town of Roseburg.\nLike community colleges in Oregon, Umpqua offers a lower-cost higher education to any student who wishes to enroll. Its programs include automotive technology, aviation, winemaking, green technology and hospitality.\nMercy Medical Center in Roseburg received 10 patients from the shooting scene, the hospital said via Twitter.\n\"Please continue to pray,\" the hospital tweeted.\nElin Miller, who was a school board member until July, said it's been hard for her and others in the community to not know the names of the victims.\n\"It's going to be quite an impact when we realize who is affected and what families,\" she said.\nBut Miller said the community is resilient. A fund has already been created to help families, she said.\nTo donate: Visit any Umpqua Bank and mention the Greater Douglas United Way : UCC Relief Fund.\nBetsy Hammond and Anna Griffin of The Oregonian contributed to this report.\n-- Emily E.
