They want to rub shoulders with the spectators.\"\nIndoor track is more conducive to fan-athlete interaction, Lananna said.\n\"It's louder, it's faster, people are closer to the track --it's all that stuff,\" Lananna said.\nHe will try to export some of that off-site.\nMedal ceremonies will take place on the other side of the Willamette River, at Pioneer Courthouse Square.\nLananna wants to have an orchestra in place to play the national anthem of the winner's country live. Spectators will be able to sip a beverage in an on-site beer garden as they take it in.\nAllyson Felix Talks About The 2016 World Indoor Championships Felix hopes to double in the 200 and 400 in the 2016 Olympics.\nFelix and Richardson shot commercials to promote the World Indoor on Monday night.\n\"I had to get my inner-Denzel Washington on,\" Richardson quipped. \"In between takes, every now and then I had to ask myself what would Meryl do?\"\nRichardson said he hopes to compete at the World Indoor Championships.\n\"The plan is to do World Indoors,\" he said. \"But of course, the biggest goal of the year is the Olympics.\"\nFelix said she normally uses indoor track to train for the outdoor season.\nShe earned 2012 Olympic gold in the 200. She won the 2015 World Championships in the 400. She would love to run both at the 2016 Olympics, and is taking a hard look at what makes sense for Portland.\nShe wants to compete in the World Indoor. This will be the first time since 1987 it's been held in the U.S., and only the second time ever.\n\"I'm very excited about this event, and that it is here,\" she said. \"I think it's about time.\"\nBen Blankenship of Eugene-based Oregon Track Club Elite will have added motivation for the 2016 indoor season.\nHe missed making the 2015 USA Track & Field World Outdoor Championships team in the 1,500 by .02 of a second last summer at Hayward Field.\n\"It was a disappointment, obviously,\" Blankenship said. \"I think I recovered fairly well.\"\nHe went on to post some strong results on the European circuit. And Blankenship's season leading up to the USATF Championships was successful, too.\nHe was second in the mile and two-mile at the 2015 USA Indoor Championships, and anchored Team USA's world-record-setting, distance medley relay at the World Relays.\nHe plans to run at this year's USATF Indoor, March 11-12, also at the Oregon Convention Center, and hopes to qualify for the World Indoor.\n\"I hope to build on this year and make the world indoor and outdoor teams,\" he said.\nBlankenship has an affinity for indoor track.\n\"I like the environment and I like the setting,\" he said. \"And this year, I especially like that it's 100 miles away from my house.\"\nLananna said about 58 percent of available World Indoor tickets have been sold.\nTo this point, fans only have been able to purchase ticket packages for all three days of competition in the convention center.\nThe men's and women's pole vault will take place in the Moda Center on March 17, and will be free.\n\"We're going to wait and keep going with the packages,\" Lananna said.\nHe said he expects single-session tickets to become available after Jan. 1. Tickets to the USATF Indoor Championships also will go on sale then.\n-- Ken Goe\nkgoe@oregonian.com\n503-221-8040 | @KenGoe", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KenGoe"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:15:39.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
