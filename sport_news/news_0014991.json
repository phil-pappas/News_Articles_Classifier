The various stories about his potential return seemed designed to do little more than use St. Pierre’s popular name to draw readers. Clickbait, if you will. \nThen, last week happened. \nSpeaking with RDS in Montreal, the man affectionately known as GSP hinted a return might not be so out of the question. \n“I’m starting to get the feeling, more and more, to come back,” St. Pierre told the TV station in an interview that was then translated by MMAFighting.com. “I watch the fights to see what’s going on in my division and I’m staying in shape. \n“It’s like a knife that I have to keep sharp just in case I ever decide to jump back in the mix.” \nNow, St. Pierre saying he’s considering return isn’t the same as him actually stepping into the octagon. But, at least one major obstacle to his return was removed when the UFC introduced its robust new drug-testing policy earlier this year. \nSt. Pierre has been vocal over the past couple of years about the need for further testing and has been encouraged by the more comprehensive testing that MMA’s most popular organization has put in place. \n“Many of my regrets in life have nothing to do with things I have done, but rather things I didn’t do,” the 34-year-old said. “If I have one regret, it’s that I didn’t speak up sooner. \n“In fact, I’ve been talking for a while but they ignored it. At the end, I wanted to make the drug tests public, I should have insisted on that well before.” \nROUSEY’S MOM ATTACKS \nRonda Rousey’s mom isn’t holding back her opinion on the UFC women bantamweight champion’s coach. \nRousey trains with Edmond Tarverdyan, but while the partnership has seen her rise the UFC ranks to become one of the most popular female athletes in the world, her mother isn’t a fan. \n“I think Edmond is a terrible coach and I will say it publicly,” AnnMaria DeMars told LatiNation. “I think he’s a terrible coach. I think he hit the lottery when Ronda walked in there. \n“She was winning before she ever met him. She probably won 99% of the judo matches she ever fought in.” \nAccording to MMAFighting.com, the root of DeMars’ issue stems from Tarverdyan’s decision not to train Rousey for several months when she arrived at Glendale Fighting Club, mostly because she was a woman, despite her Olympic bronze medal in judo. \n“She was one of the top athletes in the world when she walked in there and he wouldn’t even give her the time of day for months,” DeMars said. “Somebody like that is a terrible coach.” \nDILLASHAW RESPONDS \nThe war of words between Urijah Faber and T.J. Dillashaw isn’t going anywhere, apparently. \nThe basics, for those who’ve missed the ordeal: Dillashaw left the Faber-run Team Alpha Male after six years to go train with a new camp in Denver. Faber subsequently said the UFC’s bantamweight champion was no longer welcome at the gym he owns. \nSpeaking to Ariel Helwani of the MMAHour podcast on Monday, Dillashaw didn’t exactly hit back, but he did speak about the issues that have arisen between the two fighters. \n“I’m just trying to look past all this and understand that maybe his feelings are hurt,” Dillashaw said. “But he kind of put me on blast when he put me on that podcast. I’m trying to be a bigger man and not to bring up any negativity of what he’s doing in Sacramento (at Team Alpha Male) because it would be very to do so.” \nAROUND THE OCTAGON \nJohny Hendricks has blamed deer meat for his missed weight cut a couple weeks ago at UFC 192 ... Stipe Miocic has withdrawn from his heavyweight bout with Ben Rothwell at UFC Fight Night: Dublin. Given that a win very well might have earned him a title shot, it’s a big blow ... If you feel like reading between the lines, it’s sure sounding like Daniel Cormier expects his next title defence to be a rematch against Jon Jones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:08:52.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
