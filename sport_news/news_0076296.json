Pique has been targeted by sections of the Spanish support since he mocked Real Madrid during Barcelona’s treble-winning celebrations at the end of last season. Despite Spain coach Vicente del Bosque and his teammates’ pleas for the unjust treatment to stop, the former Manchester United man was roundly whistled at the start of the match before some began to applaud him as the match developed. “The tendency is changing. The whistles are heard more loudly than the applause but it is getting better,” he said. “In no moment will they find that I have said something negative about this national team or this country.” Pique, 28, is a huge personality in Spain as he has two sons with Colombian pop superstar Shakira and has campaigned in favour of a referendum to decide on Catalan independence. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:00:49.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
