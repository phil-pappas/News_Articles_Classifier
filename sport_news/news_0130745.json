Both games resulted in Memphis wins, and with Joerger talking about cleaning up some things.\nStill, the coaching staff sounds confident that the mistakes aren't an indictment about whether the Griz are capable of executing Joerger's motion offense.\n\"We are playing with the dribble too much. We need to pass and cut. We got a lot of good things happening for us when we do that,\" Joerger said. \"But we dribbled it, tried to make pocket passes, tried to play in crowds, and we just had too many turnovers (against Maccabi Haifa).\"\nThe Griz play their third preseason game Monday night at point guard Mike Conley's alma mater, Ohio State. Conley has six turnovers and four assists in 39 minutes in two preseason games. The Grizzlies' mistakes haven't necessarily been a result of playing too fast. Players have appeared to operate as if they are in an all-star game where passes are less deliberate.\n\"Everybody is trying to make the great play, the great pass instead of making the easy play,\" Conley said. \"It's the first two games, so it's just something to work on. In preseason a lot of guys are eager to show what they've learned or picked up in the summer. Everybody is trying to show what they can do. It's a process. We'll be better.\n\"When you're playing with different guys you're not used to playing with, it takes time to gel. It's a process. We're learning each other and understanding what everybody is about. It's good that we're knocking out the kinks now.\"\nTurnovers among the Grizzlies' top three players – Conley, Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol – have been uncharacteristic. The Griz were one of the best teams in the NBA at taking care of the basketball and are counting on limiting their turnovers to 13-15 per game.\n\"We've made a lot of mistakes as far as running plays and timing-wise,\" Gasol said. \"But as long as we all are on the same page defensively, being active and not reactive, we'll be fine. We just have to stay respectful to our principles.\"\nJoerger agreed with Conley's sentiment as he lauded how newcomers Matt Barnes and Brandan Wright have fit on both ends of the court.\n\"You get a little bit more serious at some point in the preseason schedule,\" Joerger said. \"You eventually gain some confidence and play dress rehearsal or get close to it, and then you're at the regular season.\"\nLeBron to play; Williams likely out\nCavs swingman LeBron James has a noted affinity for Ohio State and figures to play tonight against the Griz at Ohio State. But James likely will sit out the next night in Cleveland.\n\"I know for sure I'll be active Monday in Columbus and then we'll figure out Tuesday after that,\" James told the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\nWhen asked about his plans by reporters, Cavs coach David Blatt said James would \"probably play one of the two.\"\nMeanwhile, point guard Mo Williams likely won't play against the Griz. Blatt told Cleveland media that he was probably going to give Williams the night off.\nWilliams, 32, isn't hurt. He's in line for some rest as part of the team's maintenance program for veterans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:44:09.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
