Starr's Mill then rebounded from a loss earlier in the week to Northgate for a 6-0 shutout victory led by Alysen Febrey's complete- game effort along with 4 RBIs for the Lady Panthers. \nOla finished the No. 3 seed out of 4- with an 8-3 win over Starr's Mill, which claimed the fourth and final state playoff berth out of the region. Northgate placed fifth and out of the postseason picture. \nAgainst Ola, Northgate jumped out to a quick 1-0 lead in its first at bat and it held until Ola countered with a run in the bottom of the fourth. \nThe Lady Mustangs took a lead for good with a three-run rally in the bottom of the fifth, highlighted by Taylor Robinson's tworun homer. The play came after an error allowed a go-ahead run to score. \nBut Northgate managed to put together runs in both the sixth and seventh, first closing within a 4-2 deficit on Sadie Proctor's RBI single to score Raegan Kinsch. \nAfter Brittany Trammell retired the Ola side in the sixth, the Lady Vikings quickly put together a run starting when Morgan Runyans drew a leadoff walk. Dani Mitchell's single pushed pinch runner Myriah Render to second and put the tying run on base. \nTwo batters later, Jessica Cochran drove Render home with a two-out single, closing the lead to 4-3. But the game ended when Ola shortstop Jordan Doggett snared a line drive for the final out. \nNorthgate's run production went cold against Starr's Mill and Febrey despite posting six hits. The Lady Vikings had a pair in the bottom of the first on a double by Mitchell and a single by Charla Echols, only to have Starr's Mill cut down Mitchell at third on the latter hit. \nFebrey helped her own cause during a fourrun outburst in the second inning, capping off four consecutive hits by the Lady Panthers with a three-run homer. \nThe top four hitters for Starr's Mill were a combined 8-for-12 with 6 RBIs in the victory. \nWoodland-Henry won the 4- championship over Union Grove. \nNorthgate finished the 2015 season with a 14-13-1 overall record.
