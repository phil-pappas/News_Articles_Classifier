He’s also refereed games at the college level for many seasons. \n“I’ve gotten over games this season,” said Rosintoski, who also officiates girls lacrosse and youth and varsity baseball. “It’s a solid schedule for me.” \nRosintoski has also traveled around the country to officiate games as he’s been involved seven times in the World Scholar Athlete Games hosted by the University of Rhode Island; the Super Clubs tournament in Florida; and the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Ga. \n“The fact I’ve got to do the Carrier Dome six times for games and the World Scholar Athletes was very satisfying,” said Rosintoski, who was a longtime physical education teacher in the Carthage school district. \nHis officiating career began in Monroe County after ending his career with the SUNY Brockport men’s soccer team. Rosintoski’s first game as a referee was a memorable one. \n“I was scheduled to do a JV game for Bishop Kearney in Rochester, and I arrived and saw the field wasn’t lined, had no nets and my partner didn’t show up,” Rosintoski said. \nHe said he received 8 dollars and no mileage payment for officiating his first game. \nRosintoski moved to Watertown and joined its local referees board in 1967. \nHis children are carrying on the family love of athletics and officiating. Each member of his family was a member of the Carthage lacrosse programs. His son, Brian, became one of the youngest lacrosse officials in the country when he started doing games at the age of 16. Brian Rosintoski is working high school and college games in the Buffalo area and is nationally certified for women’s lacrosse. \nEric Rosintoski has officiated soccer and Gary’s other son, Keith, was a captain for the Mohawk Valley Community College lacrosse team. Roger also was an umpire as well. \nHis eldest daughter, Sarah (Bullard) a teacher at Norwood-Norfolk, founded the Potsdam girls lacrosse program after four years at SUNY Potsdam, and his other daughter, Melissa, helped lead the Brockport women’s team to two NCAA Division III tournament appearances. He also credits his wife of 31 years, Linda. \nRosintoski said the area has been lucky in that 10-12 new referees are grasping the game fairly quickly, but local boards are always looking for more. \n“We do need younger officials for many reasons,” Rosintoski said. “We might need them due to schedule conflicts or because of work schedules.” \nHe’s also helped mentor many of the newer refs and is always willing to give them advice. Newer officials are usually paired with veterans for those situations. \n“No one has ever done the perfect game,” Rosintoski said. “The goal is to work hard and get better each game.” \nRosintoski added that it can help when a new official has played the sport, but it’s not completely necessary. \nRosintoski is also an avid sports card collector and has given out cards to local players since 1988. He even operated a sports memorabilia shop from his home in Black River for a time. He’s given out soccer and baseball cards to team captains and to most valuable players in youth baseball. But last year’s present was special as he handed out Derek Jeter cards in honor of the New York Yankees captain’s final season. \nHe also put a special message on his cards in honor of his 50th anniversary. \n“I wanted to thank everyone for the last 50 years, so I put a little message with the cards,” Rosintoski said.
