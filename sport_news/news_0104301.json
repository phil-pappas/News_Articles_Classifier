The Wildcats broke the game open with a 28-point second quarter and showed great balance, as Carrllo was complimented by a strong game from senior quarterback Jimmy Shragge , who completed 14 of 18 passes for 207 yards and two touchdowns.\n“They looked forward to this game,” Martinez said of his players. “This is a big game. Last year, we had to win one of two with Big Bear and Shadow Hills to go to the playoffs, and we didn’t and we lost on a coin flip\n“We knew we didn’t want to be in that situation again.”\nBig Bear (4-3, 1-2) was held to 100 yards of total offense and did not get inside of the Twentynine Palms’ 30-yard-line.\n“We’ve just got to regroup and come back,” Griffiths said. “We’ve got a young group of kids, and they never went away today. I’m proud of their effort.”\nContact the writer: lnegri@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:21:48.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
