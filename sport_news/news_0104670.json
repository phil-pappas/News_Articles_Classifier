Gibson is a 271-pound bruiser, and Brechting gets up and down the floor at 210 pounds.\nThat combo might be necessary given Kampe's desire to press on defense and push the ball on offense. Without the depth to do it for the past four or five years, this team could go nine to 10 deep. It showed enough athleticism in the three Spain games to prove that's realistic.\nWhich brings everything back to the practices, where they'll need to get into shape to be able to push through games.\n\"We've got 30 practices before the first game, and it's my job as a coach to get them into playing shape,\" Kampe said. \"I'm a firm believer the only way you can get in basketball shape is by playing, by pushing yourself when you're tired and not cheating the last 15 minutes of practice when you're going up and down. You can't be taking that time off, you've got to be pushing.\"\nAs practice begins — again — the Grizzlies know what to expect.\nContact Mark Snyder at\nmsnyder@freepress.com\n.
