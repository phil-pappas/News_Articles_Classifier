Hunter Miska earned the victory by stopping 15 of them. \nThe Saints (4-2-0, 8 points) took a 1-0 lead in the second period on Evan Smith’s goal set up by Miska. Petter Makitalo made it 2-0 halfway through the third period. William Knierim and Baron Thompson set up the goal. \nVas Kolias got the Phantoms back in the game three minutes later with his first goal of the season. Tyler Drevitch and Matt Miller assisted. \nThen with 6:49 remaining in regulation, Yushiroh Hirano tied the game with an assist by Kris Myllari. \nThe Phantoms (2-2-1, 5 points) went 0-for-4 on the power play.
