The Cardinals (4-2, 2-0) have won three consecutive games and look to stay undefeated in the league while the Vikings (3-5, 0-3) are still chasing their first conference game while also hope to end a three-game losing streak when they visit Jacksonville. Kickoff is 7 p.m. Jacksonville won two conference games last week. The Cardinals beat West Carteret 44-20 on Wednesday before winning 40-7 at Richlands on Friday. The Vikings, meanwhile, suffered a 26-24 home loss to West Carteret on Friday. Jacksonville defeated White Oak 28-14 last year and 35-0 in 2013. The Vikings’ last victory over the Cardinals was a 7-0 decision in 2011. Croatan (6-1, 1-0) at Northside (5-2, 1-0) It’s an old-fashioned East Central 2-A Conference showdown at The Lions’ Den. In one corner is four-time defending league champion Northside and in the other is not Southwest and not East Duplin … but Croatan. Yes, Croatan, which finds itself in a battle for first place in the ECC when it visits Northside. Kickoff is 7 p.m. The Cougars have won six consecutive games, including last week’s 14-7 home victory over North Brunswick. Northside, meanwhile, won 27-0 at home against Dixon. The Monarchs defeated the Cougars twice last year – 28-19 in the regular season finale and 31-20 in the first round of the NCHSAA 2-AA playoffs. Northside leads the all-time series 15-1 with Croatan’s only win in the series being a 35-14 decision in 2001. Dixon (3-4, 0-1) at East Duplin (5-2, 1-0) East Duplin looks to win its second East Central 2-A Conference game in as many outings while Dixon is after its first league victory when the Bulldogs visit the Panthers. Kickoff is 7 p.m. East Duplin enters on a three-game winning streak, including a 14-0 victory at Southwest last week. A win by the Panthers this week could set up a showdown at home the following week against four-time defending league champion Northside for first place. Dixon saw its two-game winning streak end last week with a 27-0 loss at Northside. The Panthers defeated the Bulldogs 34-7 last year and 67-19 in 2013. Swansboro (4-3, 1-1) at Richlands (1-6, 0-2) Swansboro hopes to finish strong following last week’s open date as the Pirates visit Richlands in a Coastal 3-A Conference contest. Kickoff is 7 p.m. The Pirates suffered a 42-20 home loss to West Craven on Oct. 2. Swansboro’s last four games will go a long way to determine if the Pirates make the playoffs as they play host to Jacksonville next week and then Havelock the following week before ending the regular season at West Carteret. Page 2 of 2 - Richlands, meanwhile, lost its third consecutive game with a 40-7 home loss to Jacksonville on Friday. Swansboro defeated Richlands 35-14 last year and 44-13 in 2013 with the Wildcats winning in this series 10-7 in overtime in 2012. Southwest (3-4, 0-1) at North Brunswick (3-3, 0-1) Southwest looks to get back on track following last week’s loss as the Stallions visit North Brunswick in an East Central 2-A Conference game. Kickoff is 7 p.m. The Stallions suffered a 14-0 home loss to East Duplin last week. Southwest is now 1-4 at The Corral, but 2-0 on the road. The Scorpions lost 14-7 at Croatan last week. After a 28-19 win at Whiteville to open the season, North Brunswick has won every other game this season. Southwest beat North Brunswick 20-0 last year and 41-20 in 2013. East Carteret (5-2, 1-0) at Lejeune (0-6, 0-1) Lejeune faces a daunting task as it continues to look for its first victory as the Devilpups play host to East Carteret in Coastal Plains 1-A Conference action. Kickoff is 7 p.m. The Devilpups suffered a 34-14 loss at Jones Senior on Friday. Lejeune has now lost 18 consecutive games. East Carteret ended its two-game losing streak Friday with a 55-36 home win over Pamlico. The Mariners beat the Devilpups 41-7 last year to end a four-game skid against Lejeune.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:13:29.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
