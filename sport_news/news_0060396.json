We simulate it as we do every week with the music. It will be nice and loud when we are in the huddle and at the line of scrimmage. I would rather overdo it in practice. There are times in practice where we don't look very good, and that is a function of the mentality we have as a staff. \n\"I would rather wear ankle weights in practice. It is really easy to call a field pressure on a toss sweep to the field and feel good that you stopped it, but that is not doing you any good. I would rather call a defense and say what is the hardest play to defend in this and run it. You walk that fine line between we want to be confident going into the game, but at the same time, we want to have tested ourselves during practice, and the crowd noise piece is just another part of that.\" \nAccording to Pettine, the Browns' offense is taking a \"simpler\" approach to planning for Sunday's game. \n\"Going against a group that rushes the passer as well as they do, as aggressive as they are defensively, they'll bring more pressure or it'll be more exotic pressure than what Denver did,\" Pettine said. \"Just add to it, the issues with communications, simpler is better. \n\"You might have a play that could have a couple different checks based on what they're in, but if you can't get it communicated and executed in real time in that environment, it's not going to do you any good. We just have to make sure we're walking that fine line between getting ourselves in the best play but also, I said it in the meetings when we were game planning: 'Hey, just make sure simpler is better.' Simpler is better this week just because of the environment we're going to be in.\" \nBrowns quarterback Josh McCown has experience playing against St. Louis, and although the atmosphere will be different than playing an outdoor game on the shores of Lakes Michigan and Erie or in the heat of the day in Tampa, Florida, he knows the team has to focus on doing what they do well. \n\"F or us, especially with the way we've thrown the ball, obviously to have no elements and be able to go out and spin it, quarterbacks enjoy that,\" McCown said. \"I think it won't be any different. We're looking forward to it, but at the same time, you have to go out and execute and do the same things that you would do, whether it's windy or not. \n\"I think any quarterback around the league will tell you they enjoy playing inside because you don't have to worry about wind, just throw the ball and if you feel like you can be active with the ball, the ball should go where you want it to go. \n\"Domes can be tricky, but we'll work our silent cadence and do the things that we've done before, so it shouldn't be too much of an issue. Played there years ago. My first opening day start was in St. Louis. It was rocking and rolling back then. I think they were coming off of the playoffs and Super Bowl runs and stuff like that, so it was really going. It can be a very, very loud place. I've been there, but we'll have a plan for it and I think we'll be fine executing.\" \nThe key, in McCown's opinion, will be executing through the noise. \n\"When you start adding in the variables that they have as far as crowd noise and their front and all those things, you have to be careful not to add too much to your plate that you create issues for yourself,\" McCown said. \"Coaches have done and we need to do a good job of putting that plan together as far as keeping things simple so that we are able to execute in the noise.\" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LOQLvo TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:55:48.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
