Manager Mike Matheny gave most of his everyday players the night off.\nTeheran (11-8) allowed five hits, walked one and struck out six. The right-hander went 2-1 with a 1.62 ERA in his last six starts. The Braves' season ends Sunday.\n\"I know we were playing the best team in the National League,\" Teheran said. \"I was really focused on this game. I think I did really good.\"\nThe Cardinals had the bases loaded with no out in the fifth but came up empty when pinch-hitter John Jay grounded into a double play and Tommy Pham struck out.\nAtlanta, which stranded 12 runners, went up 2-0 in the third on Castro's second homer and A.J. Pierzynski's RBI double. Castro's RBI double and Nick Markakis' RBI single in the eighth made it 4-0.\nJaime Garcia (10-6) gave up six hits and two runs with two walks and five strikeouts in his shortest outing since April 19, 2013 at Philadelphia. St. Louis has been shut out in all six of his losses.\n\"I wanted to get a feel for things and I was able to accomplish that,\" Garcia said. \"All I can say is I'm going to be ready to go next week, whenever it is (that he pitches).\"\nCardinals ace Adam Wainwright, making his second relief appearance since returning this week from an Achilles injury, faced four batters in the seventh. Castro reached on an error.\nThe Braves used four relievers. Closer Arodys Vizcaino, pitching the ninth in a non-save situation, struck out Pete Kozma to end it with a runner at second.\nSAME TRADE, DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS\nThe deal that sent right fielder Jason Heyward to St. Louis and starting pitcher Shelby Miller to Atlanta last winter hasn't exactly been a blessing for both.\nHeyward, who was given the night off, returned to Turner Field for the first time since last November's trade and leads his new team with a .292 average and 23 stolen bases.\n\"It'd be more of a homecoming if more of the teammates I played with were still here,\" Heyward said. \"I know this is the team I broke in with and I played a lot of games with, but it's a different team and a different vibe.\"\nMiller, whose new club has the majors' third-worst record, remains close with Matheny and several former teammates. He'll be cheering for them when the playoffs start.\nDespite making the NL All-Star team, Miller is 0-16 in his last 24 starts, but has a 3.77 ERA over that span since May 17. He will try to end the streak Saturday.\n\"They're some of my best friends and I wish them the best of luck, but I'm going to try to beat them tomorrow,\" he said. \"They're not going to get out of here easy, that's for sure.\"\nTRAINER'S ROOM\nCardinals: Matheny hopes OF Stephen Piscotty can play Saturday or Sunday. The rookie suffered a head contusion in an outfield collision on Monday and spent the night in a Pittsburgh hospital. Matheny said Piscotty passed a concussion test and did some hitting and running before the game.\nBraves: RHP Paco Rodriguez, acquired in the trade that brought third baseman Hector Olivera from the Los Angeles Dodgers, has undergone Tommy John surgery and will miss all of next season.\nUP NEXT\nCardinals: RHP John Lackey (13-9) is 1-0 with a 1.46 ERA in two career starts against Atlanta.\nBraves: RHP Miller (5-17) will face St. Louis for the second time. He lost 1-0 at Busch Stadium on July 25.\n1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
