The Sharks moved their AHL team from Worcester, Massachusetts, to San Jose after last season.

(Josie Lepe/Bay Area News Group) \nSome attendees were die-hard Sharks fans who have followed the team for more than 20 years. Others, mainly young kids, were seeing professional hockey for the first time and perhaps just as interested in waving and smiling for the Jumbotron as in watching the actual game. \n\"Hockey at any level is good, and these guys are at the next level below the Sharks,\" said Todd Baggett, a Santa Clara resident who has had Sharks season tickets since they began to play at SAP Center in 1993. \nThe first objective for the Barracuda is to develop players and hopefully prepare them for the NHL. But another goal is to promote the sport and develop a larger fan base, something that might have started Friday if the number of children in attendance was any indication.

For the inaugural game, we thought it would be a lot of fun.\" \nThe Barracuda players and coach Roy Sommer wish they could have made a better first impression, as San Jose fell behind 2-0 after the first 15 minutes, prompting a \"Let's go 'Cuda\" chant to try to help jump-start the home team. The crowd cheers after the San Jose Barracuda scores a goal against the Rockford IceHogs in the first period at SAP Center in San Jose on Oct. 9, 2015. (Josie Lepe/Bay Area News Group) \n\"We're trying to make this a winning environment and be the next big team here,\" Barracuda captain Bryan Lerg said. \"Having the Sharks is one thing, but we want to be that team that people want to come and see, too. That's why we're a little disappointed after tonight with that big of a crowd. Hopefully they come back.\" \nLate in the first period, Micheal Haley, starting his second full season in the Sharks organization, beat Rockford goalie Michael Leighton between the legs with a wrist shot. The Barracuda tied the game early in the second period on the power play, Lerg scoring on a slap shot from between the circles. \nFans had their favorites. One of the loudest cheers of the first two periods came when Frazer McLaren and Mike Liambas dropped the gloves and traded haymakers 8:54 into the second period. \nTwo of the Barracuda's most recognizable players, defenseman Mirco Mueller and forward Nikolay Goldobin, got the biggest cheers in pregame introductions. The 20-year-old Mueller, the Sharks' first-round draft pick in 2013, played 39 NHL games last season, and Goldobin was the Sharks' first round pick last year. \n\"I think some people saw the American Hockey League's a pretty good league,\" Sommer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:51:27.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
