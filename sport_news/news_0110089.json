One thing he doesn’t want to do is look back, and the Chicago swingman has gone to an unusual length to ensure that the figurative event doesn’t literally happen. \nFrom a lengthy (and highly readable) profile published Monday by Chicago Magazine : \nStill, [Butler] loathes reliving the past—so much so that he has removed the rearview mirror on his car (yes, really) as a symbolic reminder to never look back. \nYikes, here’s hoping the only parking Butler plans on doing involves the low block, and is not of the parallel variety. Or does he own one of those cars with the backup cameras? \nIn any case, Butler has certainly come a long way, and not just since he joined the NBA as the 30th pick in the 2011 draft. He had a rough childhood in Texas, one in which his mother kicked him out of the house when he was 13, forcing him to live with a high school teammate’s family. \n“I don’t ever want [the past] to define me,” he told Chicago Magazine’s Bryan Smith. “I hated it whenever it came up because that’s all anybody ever wanted to talk about. Like, that hasn’t gotten me to where I am today. I’m a great basketball player because of my work. I’m a good basketball player because of the people I have around me. And if I continue to be stuck in the past, then I won’t get any better.” \nFair enough, and another anecdote in the story reveals that Butler’s mindset doesn’t just cause him to make questionable alterations to his vehicle, but it also leads to acts of altriusm. From Smith’s report: \nButler’s less-than-idyllic upbringing may explain the roots of one ritual that has become a rule with him and his roomies: When you go to the grocery store, you pay the bill of the person behind you in line. “I don’t care how many groceries they have. It could be a 99-cent ice-cream cone or a $2,000 grocery bill,” says Butler. “We have been so blessed. It’s fun.” \nPresumably, that policy has led to many grateful but confused grocery-store patrons, who really wanted to thank the tall guy ahead of them in line and couldn’t understand why he refused to look back.
