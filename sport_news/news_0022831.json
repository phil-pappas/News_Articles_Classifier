His Panthers feature a wide-open passing attack that's triggered by quarterback Kory Linaweaver. The senior has thrown for over 1,200 yards and nine touchdowns this season. His favorite targets are senior Cole Kruse, who has 36 receptions for 473 yards and three TDs and James Sappington, who's caught 34 passes- good for 429 yards and six touchdowns.\nThe Panthers running game is built around running backs Baylee Custer and Carter Lanning, who've combined for 411 yards and eight TDs. They're running behind an offensive line that features a trio of strong seniors and two gifted underclassmen.\nThey'll face off against a Lee's Summit West defense that's fast and physical. No one exemplifies that more than Tyler Boehm. The senior linebacker plays all over the field, and is a big-time hitter.\nThe Titans feature an excellent secondary, with sophomore Mario Goodrich and senior Bennett Fredrickson combining for seven interceptions.\nWest's spead offense is built around junior quarterback Cole Taylor, who's tossed nine TD passes this season. His top three targets are senior Jacob Katzfey (22 catches for 425 yards and two TDs), Mario Goodrich, a sophomore, who's grabbed 5 passes for 99 yards and two touchdowns and junior Zach Shaneholtzer, who has 180 receiving yards and three touchdowns.\nThe Titan running game features sophomore sensation Phillip Brooks, who's averaging over five yard a carry. He operates behind one of KC's best offensive linemen, Bowe Wilson, a 6-3, 290-pound left tackle, who's committed to Nebraska.\nThe Panther defense counters with one of the area's top pass rushers, Anthony Payne. The 6-3, 265-pound junior is being recruited by Missouri, Arkansas and Iowa State, among others.\nWhen- and if- those two go head to head, it will be something to see.\nThe contest kicks off Friday night at 7:00 on KSMO-TV. Steven Davis will have the play-by-play call. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
