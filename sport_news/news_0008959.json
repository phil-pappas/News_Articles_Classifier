So, we're just going to see how it loosens up and see how he feels.\"\nTexas Tech's head coach said Sadler is also day-to-day, adding the Argyle-native has not been a full participant in practice.\n\"Day-to-day with him, we'll see.\" Kingsbury said of Sadler after Tuesday's practice. \"He was very limited today.\"\nThe main concern with Mahomes is missing reps during practice, which could negatively affect his performance.\n\"I think he could miss practice time, what I'm worried about is it limiting his game,\" Kingsbury said. \"A big part of his game is being able to move around, extend plays, the quarterback run stuff. And even Saturday was having trouble stepping into some of his throws there at the end. So if he's not able to play up to his potential we'll rest him and go to the next one.\"\nWaiting in the wings is junior Davis Webb, who would step into the starting role if Mahomes is not able to face the Bears.\nSenior receiver Jakeem Grant remains confident the Red Raiders' high-powered offense can flourish with either quarterback at the helm.\n\"It wouldn't be different at all,\" Grant said. \"We have chemistry with Davis Webb. The offense has chemistry with him and the receivers have chemistry with him so it wouldn't be different at all. Davis - he's a great quarterback just as well as Pat, and they're both great quarterbacks so I feel like we can win any game with either one of those guys.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_"], "published": "2015-09-30T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:39:32.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
