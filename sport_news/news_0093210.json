(Photo: Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY Sports)\n15 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE INDIANAPOLIS — Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck was not seen at practice Friday and is likely to be listed as questionable according to coach Chuck Pagano, who was nevertheless confident his franchise quarterback will play.\nBut for the second time in three days the Colts added a quarterback to the roster.\nJosh Johnson, most recently with the New York Jets, was signed Friday (the team released cornerback Shaun Prater), giving them three quarterbacks on the active roster. Additionally, Alex Tanney, added on Tuesday, remains on the practice squad.\nIt raises further questions about starter Luck’s status with the Jacksonville Jaguars coming to town. Typically the Colts carry just two quarterbacks on the roster: Luck and backup Matt Hasselbeck. In light of Luck’s right shoulder injury — he’s been limited in practice all week — the Colts are making contingency plans for Sunday’s game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nUSA TODAY SPORTS WIRE\nUSA TODAY Sports' Week 4 NFL picks\nAbove all Luck has been dependable throughout his football career. Dating back to his college days, he’s made 86 consecutive starts. The last miss came December 31, 2009 – Luck’s freshman season at Stanford – after he underwent surgery on a finger on his throwing hand.\nHe’s made 57 straight starts to begin his NFL career – no small feat when you consider the offensive lines he’s played behind.\nAs for Hasselbeck, the 16-year veteran hasn’t made an NFL start in nearly three years. His last came with the Tennessee Titans on Nov. 12, 2012. Asked if he’d be ready if called upon, Hasselbeck didn’t flinch.\n“That’s my job,” he said. “I need to do that. It’s one of the things required by my job. If necessary, I’ll be ready to go.”\nOn the other side, the Jags will be without receiver Marqise Lee (hamstring), right guard Brandon Linder (shoulder), defensive tackle Sen’Derrick Marks (knee) and running back Denard Robinson (knee). Tight end Julius Thomas (hand surgery) also is not ready to debut for his new team. However left tackle Luke Joeckel, safety Johnathan Cyprien and defensive end Andre Branch will return after missing games.\nIn other injury news Friday:\n— After sitting out Week 3 with an injured throwing shoulder, New Orleans Saints QB Drew Brees is expected to play Sunday night against the Dallas Cowboys, according to coach Sean Payton. Brees, who'd never missed a Saints start due to injury, has practiced all week.\n— A concussion will keep Carolina Panthers MLB Luke Kuechly out for the third consecutive game. WR Jerricho Cotchery (ankle) is also out against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers while RB Jonathan Stewart (tibia) and fullback Mike Tolbert (groin) practiced Friday and are listed as probable.\n— Houston Texans RB Arian Foster (groin surgery) will be a game-time decision Sunday against the Atlanta Falcons. He has not played this year since injuring himself in training camp.\n— Philadelphia Eagles RB DeMarco Murray, who missed Week 3 with a lingering hamstring issue, will be a game-time decision Sunday against the Washington Redskins on what is likely to be a wet field.\n— As expected, the Buffalo Bills won't have RB LeSean McCoy (hamstring) or WR Sammy Watkins (calf). McCoy indicated he could be out until his injury fully heals.\n— The Miami Dolphins could have an issue at tight end with Dion Sims (concussion) doubtful and Jordan Cameron (groin) questionable to face the New York Jets in London. Dolphins LT Branden Albert (hamstring) is also doubtful. The Jets will be without G Willie Colon (knee) and TE Jeff Cumberland (concussion) while WR Eric Decker (knee) is questionable. CBs Darrelle Revis (hamstring) and Antonio Cromartie (hip), LB David Harris (finger) and RB Chris Ivory (quadriceps) are expected to play.\nContributing: The Indianapolis Star's Zak Keefer\nPHOTOS: Week 4 games ranked by watchability\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn NFL Week 4 games ranked by watchability Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
