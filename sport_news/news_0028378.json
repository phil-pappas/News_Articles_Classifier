We played Confederation Cup finals in the first year and we lost. We also lost in last year’s semi-finals, but this year we’ve vowed not to let this final slip through our hands, and we’ve made it. So we’re all ecstatic about our qualification to the final,” he added. \nThe swift right- back says the kind of motivation, including cash rewards, they received from club bankroller, Mois Katumbi, is something which keeps them going. \n“Looking at the kind of motivation we received from the club owner, I think, is highly pleasing. He allots every winning bonuses ranging from our first, second and third matches. This really excites everybody to give off their best because nobody wants to lose this money,” Frimpong underscored. \nYaw Frimpong, plays for TP Mazembe alongside his Ghanaian compatriots; Solomon Asante, Gladson Awako, Daniel Nii Adjei and Richard Kissi Boateng. \nThe team faces USM Alger of Algeria in the grand finale of this year’s CAF Champions league as they chase their fifth competition title in a two- leg affair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:20:01.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
