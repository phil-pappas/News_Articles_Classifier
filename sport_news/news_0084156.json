Decker was also limited on Thursday—his first day of practice since he was injured on Sept. 21—and he's officially questionable for Sunday's game against the Dolphins at Wembley Stadium. \n\"He's a game day [decision],\" Bowles said. \"He looked better today. I'd like to see a little bit more. Hopefully, with another day's rest, he'll work out good on Sunday.\" \nDecker didn't want to handicap his chances for playing, saying he'd just see how he felt during pre-game first. \n\"I wouldn't put a percentage or number on it,\" said Decker of his chances for playing. \"I know I feel better this week than I did last week. Every day this week has gotten better, so I'm just trying to manage everything on a daily basis. [Saturday] and then Sunday.\" \nAlso on the injury front, cornerback Darrelle Revis (hamstring) said he feels \"fine\" and that he's \"looking forward to the game.\" Revis is probable. Translation: Don't worry about whether he'll play. \nRunning back Chris Ivory, who missed last Sunday's loss to the Eagles, was again a full practice participant, and he's also listed as probable, so it looks like there are no issues with his status. And cornerback Antonio Cromartie (hip) is likewise probable, so he seems to be good to go. \nThe rest of the Jets' and Dolphins' injury report: Jets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:52:42.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
