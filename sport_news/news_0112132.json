We agree that no one should be paid to honor our troops, and the league and its 32 clubs are fully committed to that. Military spending on recruiting efforts should not be confused with community programs. \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:23:46.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
