We knew going in anybody could win. Golf is one of those games where you have good days and bad days and you just try to keep your head in the game. We talked a lot about that, about staying focused and not having a blowout on any of the holes. \n“I told them to relax and play with confidence. And they did. They played as a team and I'm just very, very proud of them.” \nThe Class B golfers played the par-34 back nine holes and the Class A golfers the par-36 front nine holes at RGC. \nThe shootout originally was scheduled for Wednesday, Sept. 30, but heavy rain put a damper on that, and the event was moved to Oct. 5, which turned out to be a perfect day, weather-wise, for golf. \nIn Class B, Mount View, which earned the right to attend the shootout with a second-round divisional playoff match victory over Waterville, was ranked second and undefeated Maine Central Institute of Pittsfield, first in the North Division, while Gardiner and Erskine Academy of South China were the South Division playoff match survivors. \nIn Monday's shootout, Mount View, now 12-2 overall this season (only losses to MCI), finished first with a four-golfer, nine-hole stroke total of 170, to 172 for Gardiner, 173 for MCI and 195 for Erskine Academy. \nThus, only three strokes over the 515 shots taken separated the top three Class B teams. \nIndividually for Mount View, Austin Higgins finished with 37, Joey Danna 43, Ross DeLorenzo 44, Darrell Roberts 46 and Westley Turner and Cassidy Gerrish 47. \nMount View's Higgins and MCI's Eric Dugas were co-medalists in Class B with 37s. \nHiggins qualified for the individual state championships as a freshman, did not play during his sophomore and junior years at Mount View and then returned as a senior. \nTozier said Higgins “has been the medalist for about half the matches we've played,” which played a role in the Mustangs' top-notch campaign. \n“It's just been one of those years where everything's come together, everybody's worked hard and I'm just excited for them and for Mount View,” he said. \nIn Class A, Messalonskee of Oakland, Lewiston and Brewer were division winners. Lewiston finished at 161, Messalonskee 172 and Brewer 185. \nThe medalist for Class A was Lewiston's Stephanie Rodrigue with 38. \nThe following is a summary of upcoming events: \nOn Tuesday, Oct. 6, KVAC Class A and Class B state team and individual qualifier, 10 a.m. (Natanis, Vassalboro) \nOn Saturday, Oct. 10, state Class A and Class B team championships, 10 a.m. (Natanis, Vassalboro) \nOn Saturday, Oct. 17, state Class A and Class B individual championships, 10 a.m. (Natanis, Vassalboro) \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:07:37.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
