We want to go 10-0, but we have to go 1-0 this week to have that chance.\" \nThe Muskingum Valley League slate includes Maysville (5-1, 4-1) hosting Morgan (0-6, 0-4), New Lexington (2-4, 2-2) heading to West Muskingum (1-5 MVL), Tri-Valley (5-1, 4-0) entertaining John Glenn (1-5, 1-3), Sheridan (4-2, 4-0) traveling to Philo (3-3, 2-2) and Crooksville (3-3) welcoming Danville (6-0) in a nonleague clash. \nRosecrans (1-5, 0-2) welcomes Marietta (4-2, 0-1) in ECOL play at 7 p.m. Saturday at Sulsberger Stadium. Game Plan podcast Week 6 \nThe Blue Devils have won three of the past five meetings, but the Quakers took last year's matchup, 31-17. With Zanesville returning several key players, New Philadelphia coach Matt Dennison knows his team has to be ready. \n\"You just knew (before the season) this game was going to be one of those you point to as a big challenge with plenty at stake,\" he said. \"Right now, our focus is on winning this game and winning our league championship. That being said, our kids aren't stupid and they understand (what this game means for our playoff chances).\" \nA balanced offense makes the Quakers dangerous. Junior quarterback Logan Bitikofer is 79-of-141 for 984 yards, 13 touchdowns and no interceptions. Senior back Tyler Carter has run for 540 yards with nine touchdowns, and senior wide out Braden Young leads the team with 41 receptions, 502 yards and eight touchdowns. \n\"They have a strong-armed quarterback, receivers with good hands and a running back who is quick, runs hard and has good vision,\" Grandstaff noted. \"Their offensive line is big and athletic, and even their fullback can grind out some yards.\" \nThe New Philadelphia defense is coming off three straight shutouts with seniors Kyle Cunningham and Tucker Hill and junior Blake Bollon leading that way. \nGrandstaff expects a good challenge for his offense, which continues to gel as the season progresses. \n\"They have an impressive defensive line with athletic linebackers and a secondary that makes plays,\" he said. \"We've been running the ball well and throwing it when we want to. Our offensive efficiency has been good, but if we get in a spot where we have to throw, I'm confident in our passing game.\" \nIt's easy to notice the production the Blue Devils are getting from the backfield tandem of Leo Crosby and Deaunte Goins. But, Dennison is well aware that quarterback Derek Grandstaff and wide outs Alessio Amato and Ben Kaufman can beat them, too. \n\"On offense, they come out and set themselves up as a run-first team,\" he said. \"They can go behind that big, physical line up front and they have three great running backs who have mastered how to run and run effectively in that offense. They can keep you honest with the pass and have two big-play receivers who can do a lot of damage.\" \nThe Quakers are also focused on limiting Crosby's play-making skills on defense. \n\"He's a great runner, but he is an outstanding linebacker, too,\" Dennison said. \"They center their defense around him and feed the plays toward him. He can read and clean things up effectively. He is just fantastic in that role.\" \nThis series is known for some close games, and both sides expect much of the same again. \n\"So many times it has been a pivotal game for both of us, and the players on both teams compete at high levels against each other,\" Dennison said. \"They are very well coached and will not beat themselves so we need to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves to us.\" \nbhannahs@zanesvilletimesrecorder.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:21:03.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
