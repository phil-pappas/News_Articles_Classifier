It hasn’t taken her long to repeat the feat at the college level. Leidhold, a freshman at Franklin Pierce College, was honored this week as the Northeast-10 Conference Player of the Week and Rookie of the Week, simultaneously, as the Ravens have won four matches in a row. An outside hitter, Leidhold, who has played 14 career matches, already leads her team in kills (148), service aces (27) and points (185), while sitting second in digs (227) behind only senior Sarah MacHugh’s 311. Not bad for a young woman who called her first collegiate practice “terrifying.” “I knew it was going to be a completely different game than what I was used to and I just wanted to make sure I could keep up,” she said. “High school and college volleyball are so different. There are so many more physical and mental factors that I now have to consider and think about every second I’m on the court that I never had to think about before. It’s crazy how much I have already learned in the short amount of time I have been playing here.” Leidhold immediately found success, totaling 21 kills, 29 digs and four service aces on her first day on the court, as Franklin Pierce split with Southern Nazarene and Missouri S&T. But it wasn’t all kittens and rainbows, because she also had 15 hitting errors, five service errors and five receiving errors. “In the beginning I was so nervous that I made a lot of errors,” she admits. “Now, I’m becoming more and more comfortable on the court and have been making fewer errors and producing more.” She soon watched her hitting percentage increase. She first topped 20 percent in her fourth match, and she’s been above 28 percent in three of her last four matches, including back-to-back matches on Sept. 19 and 22 where she slammed down a combined 24 kills against just four hitting errors. She credits a lot of her early success to her high school coach, Karen Arsenault, and club coaches, including with Team New England. This past summer she was selected for a high performance New England team that took part in an international tournament and was coached by her Franklin Pierce mentor, Stephanie Dragan. “Those few weeks together, I think, definitely made the transition smoother,” Leidhold said. “She got to learn how to coach me and I was able to learn her coaching style and what she wanted from me.” It didn’t hurt playing elite competition from across the globe. “The level of play was so high and so fast, it was unlike anything I’ve ever played against,” she said. “I think that really prepared me for what I was about to walk into a few weeks later.” Leidhold was recognized for the hot start to her career with the conference awards, which came after she piled up 17 kills, 16 digs and four service aces in a 3-1 road win over Bentley. “When my coach told me I got Rookie of the Week, I was so happy,” she said. “I remember seeing the tweets of last year’s rookies of the week and knowing I wanted to be a part of that so bad. Then (Dragan) told me I also got Player of the Week and I was so happy and grateful. I am usually very hard on myself about my game, so receiving those honors really showed me that I shouldn’t focus solely on the mistakes I make.” The win over Bentley marked the fourth straight victory for the Ravens, moving them to 9-5 with a 3-0 mark in the NE-10. They’ve been particularly potent after an early stretch featuring tournaments in Texas, Delaware and New York. “We really found our game during the preseason and it was a great step into the college volleyball world,” Leidhold said. “Our team goals are to keep this winning up and do what we need to win.” The Ravens are gunning for an NCAA Tournament berth, something they’ve earned twice in six seasons under Dragan, most recently in 2013. Personally, Leidhold wouldn’t mind adding another NE-10 plaque to her trophy case, but she’s really set on just one thing: “I want to keep producing for my team and trying to get better and better every day.” So far, mission accomplished.
