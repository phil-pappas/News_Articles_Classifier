ORADELL – Kayla Whelan knew the importance of Thursday’s Big North-Patriot Division girls soccer contest between her Ramsey squad and rival River Dell.\n“We all knew how much the game meant to us,” Whalen said.\nSo the junior forward took matters into her hands, snapping a tie with an alert goal six minutes into the second half to lead Ramsey to a critical 2-1 victory.\nThe win enabled the Rams (12-2, 4-1 Big North Patriot) to remain within a game of front-running Mahwah in the division standings. The teams face each other Tuesday.\nOn the deciding goal, Whalen was trailing the play but kept following what midfielder Kelsey Larkin was doing — after Larkin made a steal around 40 yards out.\n“Kelsey brought it in it all the way,” Whalen said. “She’s so fast that I can’t keep up with her. She’s too quick.”\nBut Larkin turned and crossed the ball toward the goal, where Whalen just happened to be standing.\n“I had a defender on me and I was trying to get in front,” Whalen said. “I just managed to tip it in.”\nWhalen’s sixth goal of the season came with one of her feet.\n“I honestly don’t know which foot,” Whalen said with a laugh. “But I did get a clear shot.”\nAnd it was a game-winner, one that Ramsey coach George Wright gladly will take.\n“It’s a great win,” Wright said. “We’re in a battle with River Dell and Mahwah in the league. I think we have to win out to have a shot, so this game was huge for us. I thought we had the better of the field play and the better of the chances.”\nRamsey wasted little time taking control of this crucial match, scoring a goal just eight minutes in. Sophomore midfielder Corinne Kropas got a head on Devan Larson’s corner kick, and the play gave the Rams the early 1-0 lead.\n“It certainly helped that we scored early,” Wright said. “Once we scored, we had more confidence. We could relax and play better.”\nThe game remained that way until late in the first half, when Julie McGovern knocked home a goal off a pass from Breanne VanDeWeghe with 2:27 remaining before the break.\nThe equalizer seemed to invigorate the Golden Hawks (10-2-1, 2-2-1 Big North Patriot), but they couldn’t muster a threat after halftime. It marked the first time that the Hawks had lost since losing top player and junior captain Rachel Sorkenn to a broken leg.\nSorkenn’s sister, Alison, was solid in goal for the Hawks, making 10 saves. Ramsey junior Erica Lis kicked aside six shots to earn the victory.\n“At least we have a chance now,” Wright said. “We have a shot. We had to win this one to have that shot.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:08:35.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
