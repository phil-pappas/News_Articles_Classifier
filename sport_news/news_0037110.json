It sort of just relaxes them. I think after the penalty kick it was just complete domination. They were playing the feet and they were so comfortable. And they were just going right to goal and just things started to fall for them. It ignited them. I think it was just one of those things that just ignites you. And it relieves all that pressure. They feel the pressure of keeping zeros on the board.\" \nParkland held a 10-1 shot edge in the second half after only getting one more shot than the Zephyrs in the first half. \nFollowing Guetzlaff's penalty kick, junior midfielder Rachel Medlar scored off a pass from sophomore forward Brooke Schutter to make it 2-0 with 17:39 left in regulation. Parkland junior forward Emily Piston then took a pass from Schutter and found the back of the net five minutes later. Rachel Medlar (Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com ) \nSchutter then scored with 10:48 left following a pass from Medlar. Sophomore Darian Brickhouse capped the scoring with 4:45 remaining off a corner kick from junior midfielder Janelle Barna . \nSchutter had a goal and two assists on the night and Medlar recorded a goal and an assist for the Trojans, who finished the regular season 17-1 overall. \n\"I think Parkland's a really good team,\" Whitehall coach Dave Weitzman said. \"Al's done a really great job of organizing his team and his players this year. They have weapons. They have a lot of depth.\" \nThe Trojans proved again Wednesday night just how good they are when a penalty kick got things going. \n\"I think the first goal definitely helped ignite something in us,\" Parkland senior goalkeeper Regan Allsop said. \"We knew the goal was coming. We kept getting in and we knew one was about to come. So we just kept working hard.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:53:32.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
