The way they batted, 350-plus was always on the cards. But it was a very good a wicket to bat,\" said Dhoni. \"Our fast bowlers could not get much from the pitch, the spinners, too, didn't get any turn. Nothing went right for our bowlers. The wicket was a bit of too true for the spinners as well as the fast bowlers.\" Regarding the run chase, Dhoni said once the asking shot up above 15 an over, it was a difficult for the batsmen to win the match. \"All the batsmen tried their best. But once the asking rate shot over 15 an over after the 25th over, it was tough for us,\" said Dhoni. Asked about the overall performance of the team in the series, he said: \"There were times when we could have done better. We were slightly up and down. But overall, we did a decent job in the series. This one match has completely taken us away from the series. But this happens in cricket and we can't do much,\" said the Indian captain. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:13:29.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
