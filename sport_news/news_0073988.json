Thirty-five thousand and change turned out for the start of the biggest series in the budding history of baseball in this football state. Good golly, two Texas teams with a bona fide rivalry at long last.\nOnly the Rangers held up their end Friday, unfortunately, which pretty much sucked the air right out of the joint.\nFor further reference, the first rule of any rivalry in any sport is that it can't be one-sided. What we got Friday was the same ol', same ol'.\nThe Rangers set a tone early and didn't let up, winning 6-2 and continuing a season-long pattern.\nThat makes 13 out of 17 over the Astros and eight in a row.\nWhy do the Rangers have Houston's number?\n\"Experience might have a little to do with it,\" said Rangers starter Yovani Gallardo, who went 42/3 workmanlike innings. \"We have lots of veteran guys. We have a good clubhouse. No pressure whatsoever. Have fun.\n\"Not every game is gonna go your way.\"\nTell that to the Astros and see how it goes over. Coming into this weekend, they'd lost six of their last eight series. From the looks of it, that statistic isn't going to improve any time soon.\nNot against the Rangers, who every month, every week, seemingly every (ital)inning(no ital) answer a question previously lodged against their prospects. First it was the repair of a balky bullpen. Rangers' relievers came into the weekend with a 2.00 ERA for the month of September, best in baseball. Cole Hamels fixed the hole at the top of the rotation.\nAnd remember all the fuss about how they couldn't hit left-handers? They're now 32-29 against lefties after winning seven of their last eight, including Friday's starter, Scott Kazmir, who gave up six runs in just 32/3 innings.\nAnd then there's this: Mike Napoli caught a fly ball. No kidding.\nWith Astros at first and third and two outs in the first, you could almost hear the crowd hold its breath when Colby Rasmus lifted a Gallardo pitch high to left field. Elvis Andrus ran out. Delino DeShields moved over. For a moment, it seemed as if someone might intercede on behalf of a beleaguered teammate. Napoli, as game as anyone in manning a position he'd never played, had dropped both two of the three pop flies he'd approached since Jeff Banister asked him to change positions. Both teammates deferred, out of professional courtesy.\nSo Napoli stuck his glove high in the air, and the ball plopped into it.\nNapoli paused momentarily, arm extended with his prize, like Lady Liberty lifting her lamp.\nOther than that, we were a little light on drama Friday. As Nolan Ryan slouched in his seat behind the plate, left foot propped on the backstop, he couldn't have enjoyed the view.\nNot only did he have to watch two collisions by Astros fielders _ including one between Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa in which the latter's forearm nearly cold-cocked the little second baseman and knocked him out of the game _ he had to wonder what's happened to the team that led the division most of this surprising season.\nNone of the Astros seemed more frustrated than Altuve. In the second, with runners at first and second and two outs, he fouled off pitch after pitch. Then he lunged at Gallardo's pitch off the plate to strike out.\nHe looked up at the roof, offered a curse, then slammed his helmet into the dirt.\nThe only life the Astros could muster came in the fourth, when Gattis tripled and Luis Valbuena whacked a shot off the facing of the second deck. Once launched, Valbuena admired his work for a moment, then flipped his bat and skipped on his first step around the bases.\nFrankly, it was all the theater the Astros could muster. It seemed a little thin at that.\nMeanwhile, the Rangers remain relentless.\n\"We've said it before,\" Rangers manager Jeff Banister said, \"we'll say it again:\n\"There is no exhale.\"\nNo breather, maybe, but no real challenge from an Astros team that seems gassed. Maybe they'll be ready to belly up with the Rangers next year. But not now. On this Friday night, the lights still belonged to high school football.\nFollow Kevin Sherrington on Twitter - @KSherringtonDMN\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KSherringtonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-26T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:49:05.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
