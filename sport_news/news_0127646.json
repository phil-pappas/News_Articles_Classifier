United in the Eastern Conference.\nThe Revolution is winless in four games and squandered an opportunity to clinch a playoff place in front of an expectant record f a regular-season crowd of 42,947 at Gillette Stadium.\nHowever, New England still seems certain to make the playoffs. With one regular-season game left, the Revolution leads its only challenger for the final playoff position, Orlando City, by three points and has an eight-goal advantage in goal difference.\nColumbus' Ethan Finlay and Federico Higuain scored to help the Crew win 2-0 at Columbus.\nFinlay opened the scoring in the 40th minute and Higuain connected in second-half stoppage time.\nToronto, which had won its previous four games, had already sealed a playoff berth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:23:28.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
