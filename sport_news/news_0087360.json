You’re just flying high out there.\n“It was an unbelievable feeling, and it seems like it was just yesterday, so it does fly by.”\nNeil’s first NHL fight was against Montreal Canadiens tough guy Gino Odjick one night later, when he also picked up his first assist. His first goal came four weeks after that, against the now-defunct Atlanta Thrashers.\n“Mike Fisher took the shot, I put the rebound under the bar,” said Neil. “Bam!”\nYes, it does fly by.\nWhen the New Jersey Devils provide the opposition at CTC Thursday night, Neil will be playing his 900th game. Only Daniel Alfredsson and Chris Phillips have worn the Senators jersey into combat more often.\n“I’ve been very blessed and fortunate to play for as long as I have,” said Neil.\nThe Senators have been equally as fortunate in their relationship with the 161st pick of the 1998 entry draft, who has scored 106 goals and 127 assists along with the 2,296 minutes to put him 34th on the NHL’s all-time most penalized list. While other teams have gone through different enforcers almost annually, they’ve had a true “tough guy” who can also play the game.\nNeil knew he could never rely on his skills at this level — he could never produce the power forward-like numbers he had in his last season of junior, when he scored 26 goals and 72 assists, along with 215 PIMS, in 66 games for the North Bay Centennials. In order to survive, he quickly learned how to properly play his position at both ends of the ice. Check finishing and an eagerness to fight became his calling cards.\nNow 36, Neil has changed with the times. To keep up, he has shaved about 15 pounds off his playing weight.\n“I didn’t recognize him,” Fisher said while visiting with the Nashville Predators on Saturday. “But he’s still as strong as ever, that guy.”\nNeil wants to prove it, but through six games, he has just two penalty minutes — or one-quarter of the number of his shots on goal — and that has him joking he could be a candidate for the Lady Byng.\n“It’s not from lack of effort,” said Neil, who so far has found no takers on his invites to dance. “The way we’re playing, it’s fast hockey, and you’ve got to be disciplined. Obviously if something arises, you’re there to take care of it, but just holding guys accountable out there, that’s what I can do. If they’re willing to drop their gloves, so am I.”\nMeanwhile, Neil is about to reach a crossroads. He is in the last season of a contract that pays him a $1.5-million salary, and he has no intention of retiring.\nImagine if he didn’t get to play game No. 1,000 in Ottawa colours? If it didn’t happen with the team he has fought and bled for all these years? It would be a shame if he hit the milestone wearing the jersey of a southern-based club whose followers don’t fully appreciate all that he’s done — or what 1,000 games actually means.\nBut Neil continues to insist he isn’t thinking that far ahead.\n“Cross that when it comes,” he said. “Being here my whole career, it’s an honour. The organization is awesome. There’s so much stuff it does behind the scenes a lot of people don’t hear about. For me being here so long, you see a lot of it, whether it’s personal or stuff guys are going through, the team steps up and is a big part of helping them.\n“When I first started playing, if you would have asked me if I was going to play 900 games, I would have laughed at you. But now the reality is it’s here and I’m looking forward to it.\n“Obviously (1,000) is a great milestone,” he added. “You see Alfie and Philly doing it, and other guys around the league, but you never know what can happen. If I stayed relatively healthy last year, I would have been a lot closer ... I probably would have hit it this year.\n“I still feel great and I still feel I have lots of hockey left to play. Hopefully, I play my whole career here, finish here. Hopefully it is 1,000 games here. It would be unbelievable. But that’s out of my control.”\nCheapseats\nSenators' Chris Neil 'blessed and fortunate' to play 900 games\nBy Don Brennan , Ottawa Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 04:10 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 22, 2015 12:33 AM EDT\nChris Neil clearly recalls his first NHL game, 14 years and almost three weeks later.\n\"It was in Toronto, Hockey Night in Canada ...
