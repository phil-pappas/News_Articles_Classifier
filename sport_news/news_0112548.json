The pivotal play was not Tom Brady ’s 15-yard victory-securing touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, but his 11-yard slant on third down and 10 to Danny Amendola, who dragged Buster Skrine a few yards to extend the drive.

They were 15 minutes from first place in the division, from silencing a capacity crowd, from beating the rival Patriots for only the second time in their last nine meetings. The Jets had been this close before. They were swept last season by New England by a combined 3 points. They had contained Brady only to watch him dissect their defense, with a smart throw or audible, in the fourth quarter. Even as a rookie coach, Todd Bowles understood. As the interim coach in Miami in 2011, Bowles watched as the Dolphins went up 17-0 at halftime at Gillette. New England wound up winning by 3 points. “There are four quarters in a game,” Bowles said last week. And the fourth began with a missed opportunity for the Jets, who settled for Folk’s 30-yard field goal because Marshall dropped a back-shoulder pass that would have been a touchdown. Trailing by 20-16, the Patriots did what they do, what Brady does, even when his receivers have been dropping passes all day. On third and 17 from the New England 27, Brady fired a 19-yard pass over the middle to Julian Edelman. Onward the Patriots moved, a 10-play drive ending with an 8-yard touchdown to Amendola that put the Patriots ahead, by 23-20. Brady finished 34 for 54 for 355 yards and two touchdowns. New England won without even pretending to run, gaining a net 16 yards of the ground. The early kickoff Sunday — the first 1 p.m. start for a Jets game at New England since 2007 — belied the quality of the matchup: the teams’ combined .900 winning percentage entering the game was the second highest this late in the season for them since 2004, when both were undefeated heading into Week 7. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:13:39.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
