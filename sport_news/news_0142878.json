OSU has a 5-6 record and is 0-2 in Big 12 play. Posted: Friday, October 2, 2015 10:00 am Cowgirls facing adversity in 2015 as mistakes add up By Mark Travis Special to the News Press stwnewspress.com \nIf soccer matches were 15 minutes shorter, the Cowgirls would be nearly invincible. \nAlthough that’s overstating things, Oklahoma State’s habit of giving up late goals has been the team’s Achilles’ heel during the past two seasons. \nThe Cowgirls have conceded tying or winning goals in the 75th minute or later eight times in the past two seasons, costing them chances at season-defining upsets, a Big 12 title and the chance to move further in the NCAA Tournament. \nWhat’s worse is that the team isn’t able to pinpoint what it is that continuously troubles it as the clock ticks closer to zero. \n“I wish I knew what it was so I could fix it,” Cowgirl coach Colin Carmichael said. \nSenior defender Kelsey Bass said it wasn’t one thing in particular that has cost OSU in big games, but rather a string of errors that happen in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n“It’s not one person or one error that causes the problem,” Bass said. “It’s been a bunch of stupid little mistakes, just little breakdowns and easily avoidable things that end up happening in a row that lead to a goal. It’s not great shots or great goals, it’s just been a lot of disappointing, ‘How’d that happen?’ moments.” \nThose costly “How’d that happen?” moments started popping up three games into the 2014 season. \nOklahoma State was without several key players to start last season, which was the main reason it started with six straight losses. Despite being short-handed, the Cowgirls had a chance to secure an upset win against then-No. 2 Florida State, which would win the national title. After leading 1-0 for nearly an hour, OSU allowed the Seminoles to tie in the 81st minute before losing in overtime. \n“That was the one that hurt the most,” Bass said. “Just because we were facing adversity and because they were one of the best teams in the country. That one was a tough one to lose.” \nEven after the Cowgirls found their rhythm and went on a run in conference play that earned them an at-large berth in the NCAA tournament, they had issues closing games. \nOn the road against West Virginia in October, Allie Stephenson’s goal in the 79th minute gave the Cowgirls the lead. The Mountaineers tied the game 50 seconds later and won in extra time. \n“Part of it I think is concentration,” Carmichael said. “You get late in the game and teams get fatigued, and you get all of those late goals. I think part of it is just a mental issue. All we can do is train a little bit harder and try to focus better when we’re at the end of practice and we’re tired. Hopefully that will translate to games.” \nWest Virginia won the Big 12 regular season title with a 7-0-1 record last season, and the Cowgirls finished second at 5-2-1. Had OSU held that 1-0 lead, it would have finished with the same conference record as WVU and earned the title thanks to the head-to-head tiebreaker. \n“I think it’s been a lack of focus,” Stephenson said. “Us switching off. We’ve been trying to work on that, and we’ve been getting better, but…we did the same thing (against Washington State).” \nThe Cowgirls have lost three key games on last-minute goals this season: One against then-No. 5 Florida in Gainesville, another on the road against Washington State, who were undefeated, and their Big 12 opener at Baylor on Friday. \nAgainst the Gators and Cougars, OSU spoiled junior forward Courtney Dike’s tying goals that gave the team a chance to continue the game in hopes of a win or a tie. Instead, the Florida defeated OSU with 19 seconds left in the first overtime, and Washington State scored its winning goal two minutes before the end of regulation. \n“I think it was just a lack of concentration,” Dike said. “That’s been one of our issues. Every team has those lapses. It’s something that we are definitely concerned with but we’ve been working on it.” \nApart from the mental lapses, fatigue has been one of the reasons the Cowgirls have struggled late in games. Wearing down physically has been a consistent problem for OSU because of its lack of physicality in the midfield. \n“That’s part of it,” Carmichael said. “We’re trying to protect the center of the field right now. We feel like we’ve been exposed there a few times.” \nStephenson, 5-foot-2, and Madison Mercado, 5-4, are two of OSU’s best playmakers, but their finesse styles can be a downfall against sturdier defenders. \n“Most of the teams that we play against are big and physical in the midfield,” Stephenson said. “We have a lot of smaller, more technical players, so it’s been a challenge. But we have a good rotation going right now. We’re doing what we can.” \nMercado, a senior, has had to sacrifice for the good of the team. After starting in 59 of 60 games in the past three years, Mercado has come off the bench for five of her 11 appearances this season. \nIn addition to shuffling personnel, Carmichael has done his best to make things easier on his team by switching from his preferred 4-3-3 shape to formations that feature an additional defensive player either in the midfield or on the backline when the matchup calls for it. \n“We’re still trying to find our best shape and our best 11,” Carmichael said. “And it might just be a situation where every game is different. The nice thing is I think we are flexible and we have the ability to play one or two different shapes.” \nSophomores Anna Beffer and Laurene Tresfield and redshirt freshman Lana Duke have been asked to step into important roles as disruptive forces in the midfield, and they have performed well, allowing Carmichael to switch his tactical approach when necessary. \n“I think we’d rather have a set system that we’re playing,” Carmichael said. “But every team is different. With teams in the past, we’ve been the aggressor and we’ve been dominant. With this team, I think there are certain matchups that don’t work out particularly well for us. Throughout the year we may just have to change our system depending on who we are playing against. We’ve done that in the past, but not as much as this year.” \nCarmichael and his staff will continue to tinker with the lineup and the system to put the players in a position to succeed, but the Cowgirls also know that it is important for them to be there for one another when games get tight. \n“I think we just have to do a better job of communicating and keeping each other locked in,” Bass said. “It’s important for me to constantly talk with the midfielders to make sure they get stuck in. And I think that if I pick up my activity and my physicality, then it rubs off on my teammates. I think it’s something we are getting better at.” \nIf one of their most recent results is any indicator, then the Cowgirls may finally be turning the corner on their late game issues. Two weeks ago, OSU defeated No. 18 Arizona State, earning a 3-2 victory that required the Cowgirls to fend off attacks for the final 20 minutes. \n“We’ve pushed and reminded our team about that on many occasions,” associate head coach Justin Elkington said. “It was a big emphasis that when we get ourselves back into games, that we hold onto it.” \nOklahoma State’s win against the Sun Devils may be the kind of uplifting result that it has come desperately close to since the beginning of last season. With six Big 12 matchups left after OSU’s 0-2 start to conference play, the Cowgirls will need to draw on the experience they gained against Arizona State in order to earn themselves a berth in the NCAA Tournament.
