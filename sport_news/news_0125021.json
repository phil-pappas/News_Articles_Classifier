By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nLASALLE — After a steady rain during most of the sophomore game Friday night, the Morris football team used a steady diet of running plays to cruise past LaSalle-Peru, 40-0, and finish the season with a 4-5 record. \nAfter Austin Dearing intercepted an L-P pass at the Morris 28, the Redskins went 72 yards on eight plays, all runs, with Keagan Sobol finishing the drive with a 22-yard scoring burst through the middle. Sobol led the Redskins with 103 yards and two touchdowns on nine carries, while Michael Gerischer had 83 yards and a touchdown on 12 attempts. \nJunior quarterback Ricky Del Favero got his first start and completed 2 of 3 passes for 58 yards and two touchdowns, one a 40-yarder to Delaney Stutzki and the other an 18-yarder to Jake Webb. Del Favero also ran four times for 26 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Redskin defense also ended the season on a high note, coming up with the shutout. In fact, if it weren't for a 75-yard pass by LaSalle-Peru's Kennedy Carey to Ryan McManus on the Cavaliers' final drive, Morris would have limited L-P to negative yards. As it was, the long pass got L-P to the Morris 11, but the Redskin defense did not allow them to score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:02:31.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
