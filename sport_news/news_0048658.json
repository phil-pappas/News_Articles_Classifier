The Eagles were shut out by FSU (14-0) and Wake (3-0) at home.\nCoach Steve Addazio made two emergency personnel moves to address the Eagles’ (3-3, 0-3) red zone issues in advance of tonight’s ACC match at No. 5 Clemson (5-0, 2-0).\n“Our offense has been struggling to score points without a doubt and that goes without saying,” Addazio said. “But there are a couple of good things that have happened.\n“We are ninth in the country in time of possession which really is part of our plan to win. We are also 25th in the country in rushing. So those quiet things are going on in our offense while realizing we are not scoring points because we are not sustaining drives.”\nFreshman quarterback Jeff Smith will make his first career start and the plan is that he’ll play four quarters. Addazio also benched kicker Colton Lichtenberg and replaced him with sophomore Mike Knoll.\nSmith had platooned with redshirt freshman Troy Flutie after starter Darius Wade suffered a fractured left ankle on Sept. 18 against Florida State.\nThe two-quarterback system was discredited in the consecutive low-scoring losses to Duke (9-7) and Wake. Smith is a read-option quarterback that adds an extra dimension to the Eagles’ power-run offense that has racked up considerable yards and time of possession.\nThe Eagles are last in the ACC in passing offense with 109 yards per game — 200 fewer than league-leader Miami (309.8) ­— but rank third in the conference in rushing offense (214 yards per game) despite losing their top two tailbacks in a win over Northern Illinois on Sept. 26.\nSophomore Jon Hilliman suffered a fractured left foot and junior Myles Willis had a shoulder injury. Willis is expected to play against the Tigers on a rotating basis with Tyler Rouse and Marcus Outlow.\n“We got to continue to develop the identity of this particular offense,” Addazio said. “We want to always be physical, we want to be tough and we want to run the ball.\n“There is an identity within that identity and we are trying to regain that and get it back under control.”\nThe Eagles’ woes on their field goal unit cost them drastically against Duke and Wake. BC missed two field goals against the Blue Devils. The first was the result of a bad exchange between the snapper and holder while the second on a dreadful boot by Lichtenberg. He followed with misses from 26 and 31 yards against Wake.\n“We are a couple of field goals away from being 5-1 right now,” Addazio said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:53:12.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
