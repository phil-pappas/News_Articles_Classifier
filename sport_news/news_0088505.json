The Bobcats and Cowboys will meet twice next month, Nov. 22 at Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark and six days later in Laramie, Wyo. \nOn a day that still felt like summer, Fish and a small entourage drove the 140 miles east on Interstate 90 to promote the Billings game, for which ticket sales began Monday. Aside from responding to former coaches and players who wanted to see the rivalry reinvigorated, Fish also said it gives Bobcat boosters in eastern Montana a chance to see their team in person – an otherwise daunting task for supporters in such far-flung places as Plentywood, Wibaux and Broadus when games are in Bozeman. \nEastern Montana can easily be forgotten, but Fish said booster functions in the land of cowboys and coulees have acquainted him with an endearing culture of MSU backers. He pointed to a trip in May to Miles City. \nWhat struck him most, he said, is that the majority of MSU supporters don’t necessarily have a passion for a specific sport. They just love their Bobcats, whether it’s football, basketball, track or volleyball. \n“Salt of the earth people,” he said. “True Bobcat fans. The Bobcat pride is incredible.” \nFish said it strengthens his desire to build a winner for a fan base that has largely witnessed average basketball for several decades, with an occasional flicker of hope doused by late-season disappointment. This season is the 20th anniversary of MSU’s last appearance in the NCAA Tournament. \nFish’s first team went 7-23 overall and 4-14 in the Big Sky Conference, setting a school record for defeats. But he said attendance ticked up ever so slightly as boosters saw how hard the team played, and now he’s brought in eight new players with the pedigree for noteworthy improvement. \nInexperience has required a return to Basketball 101 in some cases, but Fish has a spark in his eye when he talks about the talent assembled. \n”Probably what I’ve done is take a little more of a rifle approach instead of a shotgun approach,” he said of drilling down to basics. “We’ve done a great deal of film work to get them to build trust. But the guys have come in and done exactly what we want them to do. We’re excited.” \nFish’s second go-round begins with an exhibition game Nov. 3 against Northwest Indian in Bozeman. The regular season starts Nov. 13 in Honolulu with consecutive games against Hawaii, Hawaii-Hilo and Nevada before the Cats come home to face San Jose State on Nov. 20 and Wyoming on Nov. 22. \n”One thing I like to do is take the program through the state,” Fish said. “Billings has the capacity to help us do that.” Jeff Welsch is the sports editor at The Billings Gazette.
