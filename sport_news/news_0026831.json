I can’t process it yet that I’m going home.” \nThe Rangers are only the sixth team in 48 division series to be eliminated after winning the first two games. The Blue Jays are only the third team in 30 division series to win after losing the first two games at home. \nThe Rangers led 2-0 on a first-inning fielder’s choice by Prince Fielder and a third-inning solo homer by Shin-Soo Choo, but Toronto forged a tied on a third-inning double by Bautista and a sixth-inning homer by Edwin Encarnacion. \nThen, the 53-minute seventh inning happened. The Rangers went ahead 3-2 when catcher Russell Martin’s throw back to the mound after an Aaron Sanchez pitch hit Choo’s bat as he stood in the batter’s box, deflected away, and allowed Rougned Odor to race home. \nPlate umpire Dale Scott originally called for a dead ball and sent Odor back to third, but manager Jeff Banister insisted that Scott check with the other umpires. Following a huddle, the run was counted and the Rogers Centre crowd snapped. \nWater bottles and beer cans rained down on the field or, in many instances, fans on the first level. But the Rangers had a one-run lead and Hamels on the mound at stretch time. \nMartin led off and sent a roller toward second base. Shortstop Elvis Andrus got to the ball, but it kicked off his glove for an error. \nThe next batter, Kevin Pillar, sent a chopper to first base. Mitch Moreland grabbed it and fired to first, but the ball skipped in the dirt and away from Andrus. \nOne game, one inning, a set of three will not define what these group of guys were capable of doing this year. \nRangers manager Jeff Banister \nRyan Goins was up next in a clear bunting situation, and the Rangers were ready. Beltre grabbed the bunt, turned and threw a strike to Andrus at third base. Andrus, though, dropped the ball for his second error of the inning. \n“We had the opportunity to win, and I let everybody down,” Andrus said. “This is the toughest time in my career right now. There’s a lot of pain right now. I feel like I let down my team and my city. It hurts.” \nThe Rangers got an out at home as Ben Revere followed with a chopper to Moreland, who threw for the force out. Hamels was lifted for right-hander Sam Dyson, the Rangers’ best reliever the past two months, and he got Josh Donaldson to lift a jam shot to second base. \nOdor, though, got his feet tangled and didn’t make the catch. The Rangers got a force out, but the tying run scored. Bautista then took care of that 3-3 tie. \nYou play the game long enough you see all kinds of crazy stuff. It was just weird. I hope I never see it again. \nRangers left fielder Josh Hamilton \nHe launched a homer to left-center field, posing and flipping his bat before the trot home. Dyson’s temper flared twice before the inning ended, but the elated Blue Jays were six outs from a celebration. \nAll four of the Blue Jays’ seventh-inning runs were unearned. \n6 Home runs for the Blue Jays in the final three games of the series, including two Wednesday in the clincher. \n“They’re a tough team,” said Hamels, who allowed five runs (two earned) and was saddled with his first career loss in a clinching situation. “You can’t really give them that inch because they’ll definitely take a mile.” \n“You’re not going to make every play, but it was a tough inning for us,” said Moreland, who made only four errors in the regular season. “Plays we should have made. You can’t give that team extra outs, and we gave them three that inning and they made us pay for it.” \nThe ultimate price, as it turned out. The Rangers’ season is done. \nALDS: Rangers vs. Blue Jays \nThursday: Rangers 5, Toronto 3 (Rangers lead series 1-0) \nFriday: Rangers 6, Toronto 4 (14), (Rangers lead series 2-0) \nSunday: Toronto 5, Rangers 1 (Rangers lead series 2-1) \nMonday: Toronto 8, Rangers 4 (Series tied 2-2) \nWednesday: Toronto 6, Rangers 3 (Toronto wins series 3-2) Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:27:29.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
