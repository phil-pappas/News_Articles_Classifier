Pleasant’s game on Friday night. Carrasco had two catches for 47 yards and a score in the loss. \nBY ANDY KRUTSINGER \nMt. Pleasant News \nThe Mt. Pleasant football team showed improvement offensively on Friday night against No. 10 Davenport Assumption, but the Panthers couldn’t quite keep up with the speedy Knights and fell, 49-14. \nThe Panthers moved the ball well during the first quarter. MPCHS came out with a more pass-heavy offense and quarterback Joe Hess was able to spread the ball around to a rejuvenated receiving core. \nFriday saw the return of starting punter and receiver Brady Sartorius, who was sidelined with a concussion the last two weeks. The extra wide out gave the Panthers a plethora of pass catchers, and Hess was able to find six different receivers throughout the game. Sartorius also made waves on special teams with 129 punting yards including one punt that rolled inside the one yard-line. \nSartorius’ punt forced Assumption to go 99-yards for their first scoring drive. The Knights finished the drive with a 25-yard touchdown run with just under four minutes to go in the first quarter. Hess found Jack Davis on a deep ball during the ensuing Mt. Pleasant possession that set up a long field goal try, but Korte Maddy’s kick was just wide and Assumption led 7-0 after one quarter. \nThe second quarter was dominated by Assumption quarterback Joe Argo, who gave the Panther defense trouble all night. He ran for two touchdowns and threw for two in a second quarter onslaught that busted the game open for the Knights. At the end of two quarters, Assumption led, 35-0. \n“The second quarter was not good for us,” said head coach Shawn Striegel, who praised the performance of Argo. “Give him credit for his athletic ability.” \nThe defense picked back up in the third quarter, but Assumption was able to push another score across on a six-yard touchdown run by Argo to make it 42-0. Mt. Pleasant, however, drove deep into Assumption territory and set up a score to start the fourth quarter. \nOn the first play of the final period, DShundric Foster sprung open on an out-and-up route that burned the Assumption cornerback. Hess found him down the sideline and in the end zone for a 27-yard touchdown pass that got the Panthers on the board. The two-point conversion was no good, and the score was 42-6. \nThe Panthers put together another big drive in the final five minutes of the game. Hess continued to spread the ball around to different receivers, and capped the drive off with a jump ball to the pylon for Alex Carrasco. Carrasco made a leaping catch over an Assumption defensive back and landed just inside the goal line for the second Mt. Pleasant touchdown. Maddy tacked on the extra point to make it 42-13. \nOn the ensuing kick-off, Assumption returner Elijah Williams, who scored the game’s first touchdown, found a seam and ran the kickoff back for the last touchdown of the game. The extra point made the score 49-13, where it would stand. \nHess’ final line was 19-32 for 359 yards and two touchdowns. Davis led the receivers with five catches for 93 yards. Foster had three catches for 47 yards and a touchdown. Carrasco had two catches for 42 yards and a score. Pat Canby, Kieran Kohorst and Sartorius finished with three catches apiece. Canby had 31 yards, Kohorst had 30, and Sartorius finished with 16. \nZac Ebeling led the Mt. Pleasant running game with 38 yards rushing on four attempts. Canby had 17 yards and Dalton Bass finished with four. \nThe loss dropped Mt. Pleasant to 0-5 overall this season, and 0-2 in the conference. The Panthers have a big game this week, at Clear Creek-Amana. A road win against the Clippers could still set Mt. Pleasant up for a playoff run with Fairfield (2-3, 1-1) and Ft. Madison (1-4, 0-3) still on the schedule. Clear Creek-Amana is 2-3 overall and 2-1 in the district with close wins over Ft. Madison and Keokuk. \n“We’re going to approach this like we just played our first season and now we move on to the second season,” said Striegel, who thinks it will take three more wins to do some damage in the district. “We’re gonna take this second half of the season as a brand new season and move forward.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:31:37.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
