USA Today Sports 4 days ago Chris Chase © Matthew Stockman/Getty Images/File Roger Federer of Switzerland congratulates Novak Djokovic of Serbia after Djokovic won their match during Day Thirteen of the 2011 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 10, 2011 in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City. 1. Outside of the Big Three (and Andy Murray), who will be the next No. 1 in men’s tennis? We’re giving Murray too much credit here, as he’s never been No. 1 and, quite remarkably, is only celebrating his 20th week at No. 2 with the rankings released Monday. But that’s too easy an answer and, even though I quite clearly refuse to utter the words “Big Four,” Murray is such an odds-on favorite that it’d be a cop-out to name him. So, who then? Process of elimination: Stan Wawrinka is too old, Tomas Berdych has just 11 tourney wins (only one of which was a Masters 1000) and one Slam final, Kei Nishikori (probably the answer most would give) breaks down too much, David Ferrer is older than Stan, Milos Raonic is too up and down right now to give him this title (although it’s possible) and Kevin Anderson has done great to get in the top 10 this week (his first ever). So we’re going to go way off the grid and say it’ll be a youngster, 22-year-old Dominic Thiem . (Another big name, just like tennis wants. Winking, sarcastic emoji.)\nAdChoices 2. Will an American man ever win another Grand Slam and, if so, when? Of course. The state of American men’s tennis is bad — laughably bad. It’s also quite surprising. There are a lot of factors working against tennis in America: it’s too expensive and it’s too mentally draining (kids would rather play on soccer teams where there’s less accountability). But golf is expensive and mentally draining and American golfers are thriving. Plenty of kids play tennis too, a lot of whom win junior majors or rise to the top of the junior rankings. And though there aren’t American women without the surname “Williams” reaching the upper-echelon of tennis at the moment, at least there are a lot in the top 100.\nBut consider: Two different men from Switzerland, which has the population of New York City, have won Grand Slams since Andy Roddick won the 2003 U.S. Open. Serbia, which has fewer people than Switzerland, produced Novak Djokovic. Croatia has the population of Oregon and won a Slam with Marin Cilic. And Spain, which is a bit bigger population-wise than California, has had at least a dozen players appear in the top 20 over that time since an American won a major. It’s a bizarre drought but one I can’t imagine will continue. There are at three American 18-year olds ranked among the top 10 of players 18 and younger . Maybe one of them will be the breakout star the sport needs.\n3. Who will succeed Serena Williams as No. 1 in the WTA rankings and when will that be? © Provided by USA Today Sports (AP) I think Serena will put herself in a position to lose the No. 1 ranking next summer, as she’s almost certainly not pulling the Ausie/French/Wimbledon triple again and she has a ton of points to also defend from Miami and Cincinnati. The top spot will be there for the taking. But will anyone grab it? If so, let’s go with Belinda Bencic , the world No. 16 who turns 19 in March. She’s only defending 500 points until the French Open and just 450 at all the majors combined, less the one-quarter of what Serena will be defending at each of the first three Slams (2,000 points). With Serena in a tennis existential crisis, expect a WTA that looks a lot like the one that allowed Caroline Wozniacki to rise to the top with steadiness, frequent play and persistence.\n4. How many majors will Serena win next year? Just one . She’ll win the U.S. Open in dominating fashion, suffer a shock defeat early in one of the other tournaments and then have a late exit at the other two.\n5. Will Novak Djokovic win the French Open next year to complete the career Slam and, either way, how many majors will he win? Yes , yes he will. Djokovic has already put together two historic seasons (2011 and 2015) and his goals now are to keep chipping away at Federer’s Grand Slam record and to get that elusive French Open title. I say he does it this year, rolling through his side of the draw and facing a lesser opponent in the final, one who won’t be able to pull an upset like Stan Wawrinka did. And then let’s give him one of the two hard-court majors as well.\n6. Will Roger Federer ever win another major? © Provided by USA Today Sports (Getty Images) Only two majors this decade makes this a delicate question but, yes , I think he will. How about this year at Wimbledon? Or, better yet, watch him win Olympic gold in Rio.\n7. Will Rafael Nadal ever win another major? No.\n8. Who will be the next first-time Slam winner on the ATP? I think we get through 2016 without another first-time winner, then see Kei Nishikori get one sometime in 2017.\n9. Who will be the next first-time Slam winner on the WTA? © Provided by USA Today Sports (AP) Simona Halep is the easy answer here, but things don’t always go according to plan on the WTA. So let’s go with an out of left-field pick: Timea Bacsinszky .\n10. Is any retired player going to make a singles comeback and, if so, who? It certainly won’t be Andy Roddick, who seems to love not playing tennis. And Marion Bartoli is smart enough to realize a Hollywood ending (plus seems quite content off the court). I don’t think Justine Henin or Kim Clijsters, despite both being younger than Serena, will return, so that leaves Flavia Pennetta . Maybe it’s only for doubles, but don’t be shocked if you see her around the court in 2016.\n11. Will anyone win the Grand Slam in the next 25 years? No . We capped it at 25 years because “never” is too long a time. But if Serena Williams, playing the most dominant tennis of her life, couldn’t do it because nerves got the best of her, I don’t expect anyone else to get close.\n12. When will Serena Williams retire and with how many majors? © Provided by USA Today Sports (USA TODAY Sports Images) It’s a tough call because no one expected Serena to be around this long as it is. But let’s say she plays three more full years (full meaning her normal reduced schedule) and quits after the 2018 U.S. Open with 26 majors .\n13. When will Roger Federer retire and with how many majors? I have the feeling Federer’s pride isn’t going to allow him to play Slams he doesn’t think he can win. Of course, that could take a while to get there,so let’s say that 2018 U.S. Open is one for big goodbyes, with Federer leaving with 19 majors .\n14. Which player will retire with the most majors: Federer or Djokovic? © Provided by USA Today Sports (Getty Images) We’ve already established that Serena’s major total will put her atop the womens’ list. And our Nadal prediction means we don’t think he’ll catch Federer’s current total of 17. So that leaves Federer and Djokovic. Is Federer’s predicted 19 going to be good enough to hold on to his title of G.O.A.T.? Absolutely . Djokovic looks indestructible right now but it all goes away just like that — SNAP. Roger Federer entered the 2010 French Open having won 15 of the last 25 majors and showed no signs of slowing down. Over the last 23 majors, he’s won once. It goes that quickly. Let’s say Djokovic ends with 16 , six more than he has right now. But if no one else rises to challenge him, who knows? (Don’t forget without either Nadal or Djokovic out there, Federer would be deep into the 20s right now.)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://tennisabstract.com/reports/rankingsByAge.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:30:30.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
