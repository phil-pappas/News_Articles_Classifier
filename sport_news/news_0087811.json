Oklahoma is 1-4 in conference play (7-10 overall). OU has lost six of its last eight matches. \nThree of their Big 12 losses, two of which went to five sets, came on the road while the other loss was suffered at home, making OU’s home conference record 1-1. Kansas State is 0-3 on the road in conference play (1-5 on the road overall). \n“Right now, (home court) is not making much of a difference,” coach Santiago Restrepo said. “We just have to do a better job playing volleyball.” \nOU beat Kansas State 3-1 in their last meeting a year ago. The Sooners lead the all-time series against the Wildcats 53-27-1 and are 25-11 in Norman with six straight home wins for the Sooners. The last time Kansas State defeated Oklahoma in Norman was in 2008. The home team has won eight of the last nine match-ups. \nThe Wildcats are currently 2-3 in conference play and 10-7 overall. They lead the Big 12 in digs per set with 16.75. The Sooners are eighth in digs per set with 12.52. Also, Kansas State is second in the conference in assists per set (13.12), a category in which the Sooners are sixth (12.08). Kansas State’s junior setter Katie Brand is second in the Big 12 in assists with 11.09 per set. \nHowever, Oklahoma is third in the conference in blocks with 2.39 per set, lead by junior middle blocker Micaela Spann with 1.18 per set. The Wildcats are seventh with 1.98 blocks per set. OU’s last two losses were to TCU and Texas, the first and second best blocking teams in the Big 12 (2.97 and 2.54, respectively). \nKansas State leads the Big 12 conference in double-doubles with 28, and the Sooners are second with 21. \nThe match will begin at 6 p.m. on Friday at McCasland Field House and will air on FSN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:36:07.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
