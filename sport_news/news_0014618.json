You can bet neither president John Davidson or GM Jarmo Kekalainen will take the blame for this, so it looks like Richards may take the fall. \nThe question is: Who goes in as the replacement if it happens? \nThe top candidate is likely John Tortorella. Fired by the Vancouver Canucks last year, he has three years left on his deal at $2 million per season. He has a strong track record, brings credibility to the market and would push the right buttons if Kekalainen wants a coach to get tough with his players. \nOther possibilities include former Senators coach Jacques Martin, former Toronto bench boss Randy Carlyle and, if they're desperate, Ron Wilson is also available. Richards isn't the only coach in trouble though. A quick check of the 30 cities indicates the temperature is high in a few other places. \nAnaheim: Coach Bruce Boudreau barely hung onto his job after the Ducks were eliminated in the Western final last spring. The Ducks have former Ottawa coach Paul MacLean on staff as an assistant and it's widely believed if a move is made there, he'll transition into the job. \nBoston: Claude Julien has three years left at $3 million per season on a deal he signed last year. The Bruins know they're in tough but you have to wonder if president Cam Neely and GM Don Sweeney will want to lay blame elsewhere and decide to pull the plug. The issue: They won't find a better coach. \nLos Angeles: The Kings may have tuned out coach Darryl Sutter and that happens all the time in hockey but the team isn't nearly as good as Lombardi makes it out to be either. Los Angeles paid John Stevens a lot of money to stay as an assistant so he makes an obvious choice. \nTHIS N' THAT \nSo, what's next for Minnesota Wild goalie Niklas Backstrom? The answer, who knows? He has lost his starting job to Devan Dubnyk and is No. 3 behind backup Darcy Kuemper as well. Right now, Backstrom, 37, who couldn't be bought out of the final year of the $4 million remaining on his contract in the summer because of a elbow ailment, isn't even getting much work at all. Minny GM Chuck Fletcher tried to deal Backstrom, who hasn't played since Jan. 13, in the off-season but couldn't find any takers so right now he's taking up a roster spot and cap space ... If the hiring of college coach's Dave Hakstol (Philadelphia) and Jeff Blashill (Detroit via Grand Rapids, AHL) works out for the Flyers and Wings, you have to wonder if more NHL GM's will start looking in that direction when they're making a change. It's a copycat league and Greg Carvel (St. Lawrence), Norm Bazin (U Mass at Lowell), Keith Allain (Yale) and David Quinn (Boston University) all have impressive resumes. \nOFF THE GLASS \nAnybody else wondering about the future of Pittsburgh GM Jim Rutherford? He signed a two-year deal with an eye toward winning a Stanley Cup and, at this juncture, they don't look like a contender ... A league executive on the buyout deal for Los Angeles C Mike Richards: \"I'd really like to know how that what happened. I've always thought of cap space as precious and they got a huge break.\" ... Calgary GM Brad Treliving has a crowded crease with Jonas Hiller, Karri Ramo and third-stringer Joni Ortio. He's expected to make a trade at some point but for the time being nobody is going anywhere because the Flames like all three and will see if the market improves. \nRUMOURS DU JOUR \nThough eyebrows were raised after Sweeney dealt D Dougie Hamilton to Calgary at the draft in exchange for picks, it's doubtful he'll be moving captain Zdeno Chara anytime soon. There was talk Chara was quietly being shopped but we've been told that's not the case. He has a cap hit of $6.96 million through the 2016-17 campaign. Not only does Chara control his own destiny with a 'no move' clause, the last thing Sweeney is going to do is move another blueliner because the club is already without injured veteran Dennis Seidenberg. It's believed when Chara's name surfaced on the rumour front last week a couple of teams who are badly in need of help on the blueline -- maybe Chicago, Los Angeles and Columbus because they've been calling around for blueline help -- picked up the phone to gauge Sweeney's level of interest in making a move. The word is they were told no dice. The Bruins are shopping for a blueliner ... If anybody wants a defenceman, give St. Louis GM Doug Armstrong a call because the word is he's willing to discus former Toronto D Carl Gunnarsson. Ditto goes for Tampa GM Steve Yzerman because the talk is either Braydon Cobourn or Matt Carle is available ... Before making a deal for a goalie, Buffalo GM Tim Murray wants to see how his team does without injured G Robin Lehner. \nHave a nice Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:29:53.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
