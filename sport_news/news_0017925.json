The 10 South American teams - including Brazil and Argentina - would be joined by the U.S. squad, Mexico and four other North American regional teams.The U.S. Justice Department indictment of several top officials from FIFA and the regional governing bodies as well as promoters cast doubt upon whether or not the Copa Centennial would be staged, saying more than $110 million in bribes helped secure rights to the special Copa America.But ESPN reported the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, would be the site of the final with one semi-final in suburban New York at the home of the NFL team the New York Jets and the New York Giants. The Copa America debuted in 1916 and has never been staged outside South America. Host Chile won this year's Copa America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:05:31.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
