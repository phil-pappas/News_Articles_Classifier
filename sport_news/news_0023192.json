Picture : George Salpigtidis \nESSENDON star Brendon Goddard has moved to shut down rumours that he could be traded in the most simple of manners. \nOne tweet that contained two “emoji” figures – one red and one black – saw the midfielder trending on Twitter last night, following a day of suggestions that the club could look to trade him. ⚫️ — Brendon Goddard (@BrendonGoddard9) October 12, 2015 \nBombers list boss Adrian Dodoro said last week that “Goddard will certainly be at the club next year” before the rumour mill churned into full force yesterday on what was the first day of the trade period. \nThe club then denied reports that he will be moved on, with some commentators still suggesting that trading him for a solid pick wouldn’t be the worst idea. \nGoddard, 30, moved from St Kilda to Essendon at the end of 2012 as one of the first big-name players to utilise free agency, winning the Bombers’ best and fairest award in his first season at the club. \nEssendon is set to continue its talks with St Kilda in an effort to get defender Jake Carlisle to Seaford, while it is also set to accept a deal that will see Jake Melksham go to Melbourne for a second-round pick.
