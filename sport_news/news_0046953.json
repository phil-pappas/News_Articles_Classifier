Their 5-8 record suggests they’re bad. And they’re coming off two ugly defeats.\nBut with the likes of S.J. Green, Stefan Logan, John Bowman and Chip Cox, the Alouettes are nobody’s gracious Thanksgiving Day hosts.\nThe 8-5 Toronto Argonauts , who play the Als here Monday at 1 p.m., don’t need much of a reminder how distastefully they were treated in their last visit.\nToronto lost Ricky Ray to a concussion on Nov. 2, and he hasn’t played since, although it’s his shoulder that’s the problem now. The Argos also lost a chance to clinch a playoff spot.\nThat’s why Argonauts head coach Scott Milanovich doesn’t see this game as a chance to get fat off a team in turmoil after coaching changes and unreliable quarterbacking.\nThe Alouettes have been through several starting QBs this season, including Jonathan Crompton (twice), Rakeem Cato and Tanner Marsh.\nIn Montreal’s last game, Cato started but he was replaced by Anthony Boone, who produced some great late-game offence, including two TD drives.\nCato will get the start Monday.\nDespite the turmoil, Milanovich reminds everyone that Montreal played giant-killers against Hamilton and Calgary this season.\n“They can beat anybody, there’s no question in my mind,” Milanovich said.\nToronto can smell the playoffs because getting to nine wins will likely assure them of a post-season spot.\nHowever, for the the Argos to keep pace with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, quarterback Trevor Harris has to clean up the interceptions — two per game over the last three and nine over a six-game span.\nMilanovich says it looks like his decision making is sound. It’s his accuracy that has been off.\nRay, meanwhile, is waiting in the wings after a good week of practice.\n“He’s (Ray) closer,” Milanovich said. “He made a jump last week. We’d like him to make the same jump he made last week one more time, and then I think I think he would be back, but he’s not there quite yet.”\nRay can throw crisply up to 30 yards but needs a little bit more zip on deep balls at around 45 yards, his current range.\n“At one point last week, he told me it feels as good as it did last year,” Milanovich said. “He still had pain, but I think that’s starting to go away.”\nHowever, until Harris loses the job, it appears it’s still his to keep.\n“I’ve said all year that as long as Trevor continues to play well, he’s going to play and I see no reason for that to change,” Milanovich said.\nNOTE: Greg Van Roten replaces right tackle Chris Van Zeyl, who has been put on the six-game injured list with a leg injury.\nMore on thestar.com\nLeafs rally from three-goal deficit but lose in shootout\nCubs even playoff series with Cardinals with 6-3 victory", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:10:07.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
