PHOTO: LINDA ROBERTSON He goes by the fight name ''Mean Hands'' and next week Kali Meehan hopes to land the cruellest of blows to Joseph Parker's career when the duo face off in Auckland. \nIn June last year, Meehan (45) won the inaugural Super 8 heavyweight tournament, despite being out of competition for about two years and in November, he sent Shane Cameron into retirement with a brutal unanimous decision win. \nNow Meehan (42 wins, 5 losses, 32 ko) plans on damaging Parker's world title aspirations when they meet in Auckland next Thursday. \nMeehan and his son Willis were in Dunedin yesterday. \nThe Australian-based New Zealander described 23-year-old Parker (15-0 13 ko) as big and strong but with ''a few chinks in his armour.'' \n''I have studied where he has weaknesses and I give myself every opportunity to get it right, exploit those weaknesses and bring the fight to him,'' Meehan said. \nDuring his 18-year career Meehan has mixed it with the best and he is fight-hardened. \nHe lost world title eliminators to Hasim Rahman in 2004 and Ruslan Chagaev in 2010 and some terrible judging saw him lose a split decision WBO world title fight to Lamon Brewster in 2004. \n''I bring real experience and you can't buy that and it's something that Joseph hasn't really faced.'' \nMeehan planned on cancelling out Parker's youth and hand speed by using his roughly 12.5cm reach advantage and beating him to the jab. \nThe 1.95m tall Meehan was unconcerned about ring rust, because he had fought after long breaks before. \n''It's not ideal, but I am used to it and the harder you work the more you create your own luck.'' \nIn preparation he has sparred about 80 rounds with a few heavyweights, including his son Willis (20), who will fight on the undercard. \n''The main thing to combat time out is quality sparring and I have certainly done my homework. \n''People think it is hard sparring with your family members, but it's just like playing football with them. You are going to play as hard as you can and it's the same with boxing.'' \nMeehan said he trained as if every fight was his last and he did not look past any opponent. \nTo coach his son and have Willis coach him was a real highlight, he said. \nMeehan grew up in Avondale before moving to Australia 18 years ago. \nHe has three sons with his wife of 24 years, Rowena, and lives on the New South Wales central coast. \nHe said it felt great to come home and get some ''good fights'' and to gain the respect he deserved. \nMeehan said he tried to persuade Willis not to box because of how tough it is, especially in the professional ranks, but he had a gift for the sport. \nAs a 17-year-old, Willis won the Australian super heavyweight amateur title before making his professional debut on the undercard when Meehan beat Cameron. \nWillis is a former Australian schoolboys rugby league representative and junior Kangaroo. \nHe played for the Sydney Roosters in the National Youth Competition in 2013-14, was picked at lock in last year's NYC team of the year and played one game in the NRL before he was sacked for off-field indiscretions in July this year. \nMeehan admitted Willis had learned some harsh lessons, but it had also helped him grow up.
