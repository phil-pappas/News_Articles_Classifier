(Photo by Harry How/Getty Images) TORONTO - \nToronto's power game got quite the charge Monday night. \nTroy Tulowitzki and Josh Donaldson each homered in a six-run third inning, and Toronto's bats broke out at home for an 11-8 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Monday night that trimmed the Blue Jays' deficit to 2-1 in the AL Championship Series. \nRyan Goins also connected and had a two-run single, one game after his misplayed pop fly set off Kansas City's winning rally Sunday. \nVeteran knuckleballer R.A. Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series Tuesday afternoon. He faces Kansas City's 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young in Game 4. \nIn the first ALCS game in Toronto since 1993, Tulowitzki connected for a three-run shot off Johnny Cueto, and Donaldson hit a two-run drive off Kris Medlen as the Blue Jays hit their first home runs of the series. \nCueto failed to retire a batter in the third inning, allowing eight runs and six hits in the worst postseason start of his career. \nCopyright 2015, Schurz Communications", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:12:21.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
