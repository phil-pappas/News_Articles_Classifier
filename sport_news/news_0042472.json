Bob Condotta, The Seattle Times Print this article Advertisement RENTON, Wash. — Coach Pete Carroll kept watching the film, looking for one more play, one more first down, that would have turned one of the more bitter regular-season defeats of his Seahawks career into one of the better victories. “No matter how many times I look at this, I can’t get the end to change,’’ Carroll said Monday of a 27-24 overtime loss at Cincinnati in which the Seahawks blew a 17-point fourth-quarter lead. Maybe what they really needed, as quarterback Russell Wilson said Sunday, was just a little more oomph. One play Carroll kept reviewing typified the thin line between victory and defeat — a deep pass from Wilson to Tyler Lockett on the Seahawks’ first possession of overtime. Lockett broke wide open behind the Cincinnati secondary, possibly able to score the winning touchdown if the ball had gotten to him in time. But Wilson, throwing on the run to evade a rush, was hit as he let go of the ball and couldn’t get enough on it. That allowed two Bengals defenders to catch up to Lockett and break up the pass. “Really had the chance to make a big play right there,’’ Carroll said. “ … You get off rhythm with the rush and then didn’t get to take advantage of the throw. He tried to go there late and couldn’t get the ball there.” Said Wilson: “Hopefully I’ll be able to get a little more oomph on it next time.’’ The possession ended with a punt instead of a potential winning touchdown, one of six consecutive punts to end the game for the Seahawks as they melted down on both sides of the ball. The offense was held to 53 yards on its last six possessions, and the defense allowed the Bengals to score on four of their last five. It was the biggest rally against the Seahawks since 2004, when the Rams also overcame a 17-point deficit to beat the Seahawks. Only five times had an opponent come back from a greater deficit to beat the Seahawks. It left them at 2-3 and facing something of an early crossroad with undefeated Carolina coming to CenturyLink Field on Sunday. “Everybody’s pretty disappointed for obvious reasons, and the whole room feels it,’’ Carroll said. “Everybody’s sharing in it. … This is the week to get moving as opposed to the next week. We run out of time for making a real turnaround here early. I’d like to see us do that.” Carroll said he was confident that can happen. He also was confident through the first three quarters Sunday, which he called “our best football, for the most part’’ this season. He was pleased by the play of the offensive line, which helped pave the way for a season-high 200 rushing yards. “Without question, the offensive line of scrimmage was really the best it’s been,’’ Carroll said. That, along with an opportune and stingy defense, had the Seahawks ahead 24-7 early in the fourth quarter before it fell apart. After converting four of their first seven third downs in the first three quarters, the Seahawks hit on just one of six the rest of the way. “Any one of those wins might have been the difference in the game,’’ Carroll said. “It’s just frustrating that we didn’t get any of them when we needed.” He specifically lamented the last two in regulation: a third-and-two with 9:50 left when it appeared Jimmy Graham had broken open over the middle before Wilson was forced to scramble and throw the ball away; and a third-and-four with 2:50 left when Doug Baldwin appeared to break free but Wilson instead was sacked. Both led to a punt and a resulting Bengals drive for a score. “He (Wilson) had a couple of opportunities that we’re kicking ourselves over down the stretch on some third downs, a couple third downs that we could have won, and we just didn’t execute as cleanly as we needed to,’’ Carroll said. “… He just missed a couple of them.’’ As for the defense, Carroll said the Seahawks didn’t do anything schematically as the Bengals gained 203 yards in the fourth quarter and overtime after being held to 216 in the first three. Carroll said the Seahawks did not get conservative with a lead, adding, “We were not sitting back, we weren’t waiting on them.’’ Instead, he said, there were simply “a couple of technique errors, leverage and stuff like that. … Really fixable things.’’ It is a realization that, in some ways, only added to the disappointment. “At least make them beat you when you’re exactly on point with what you need to do,’’ Carroll said. “We just missed some fine points there.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:20:39.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
