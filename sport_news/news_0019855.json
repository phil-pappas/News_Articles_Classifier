(Brad Mills/USA Today Sports) \nEach day this week, we’ll be taking stock of every Nationals positional group. In Part 5 of 5 today, we’ll analyze the infield. \nSeason Review \nSimply put, the catchers underperformed. Wilson Ramos was among the best offensive catchers in baseball over the past few injury-riddled seasons, offering the promise of big production if he remained healthy. He finally did — and his hitting cratered. \nRamos played in career-high 128 games in 2015, achieving a major personal goal. But he hit a career-low .229 with 15 home runs, 68 RBI and a .616 OPS while striking out a career-high 101 times. Because of injuries and under-performance by his teammates, Ramos’s struggles stood out even more. His offensive output (.229/.258/.358) was less than an average major league catcher (.238/.302/.376). \nIn some ways, Ramos had a better defensive season than offensive one . He still struggled catching throws from the outfield and some scouts pointed to lapses in game calling and receiving, such as pitch framing. But some advanced metrics and evaluators believed Ramos did well at blocking balls and calling games. Ramos made history by catching three no-hitters (Jordan Zimmermann and twice from Max Scherzer) in a 162-game span. \nBecause of Ramos’s health, 30-year-old back-up catcher Jose Lobaton was seldom used. He often started when Gio Gonzalez pitched or when Ramos was in a slump. Lobaton, known for his defense and ability to handle a pitching staff, played in 44 games, his lowest total since 2011. He hit .199/.279/.294 with three home runs, his offense affected by playing time. \nOffseason Outlook \nThe most pressing offseason questions involve the manager, the bullpen, middle infield and bench, but the catching situation could be considered, too. Ramos, who earned $3.55 million in 2015, has declined offensively each of the past two seasons, and his defense can still improve. The 28-year-old will be entering his final year of arbitration in 2016 before free agency. Will the Nationals upgrade? \nThe rough offensive season and one year left of control make Ramos perhaps more valuable to the Nationals than to another team. When the lineup is healthy, it is potent, and Ramos isn’t counted on to carry a heavy load. A strong-hitting catcher is almost a luxury. Perhaps the coming free agent season will push him to more improvements. Lobaton, who is under two more years of team control, figures to remain the back-up. \nPossible free agent targets \nShould the Nationals decide that they need to upgrade at catcher, the biggest name on the market will be switch-hitting Matt Wieters, who could be extended a qualifying offer by the Orioles this winter. Wieters is one of only a small handful of everyday catchers available in a weak free agent class that includes A.J. Pierzynski, Brayan Pena, Alex Avila and Chris Iannetta. \nIn his first year back from Tommy John surgery, Wieters was held to 75 games, hitting .267 with eight home runs. Despite that, the 29-year-old three-time all-star could still land a nice multi-year deal through agent Scott Boras. Wieters could be of interest to the Braves, who need catching help: He owns a house in Atlanta and went to Georgia Tech. But if the Nationals wanted to improve at catcher, scouring the trade market could be possible, too, for players such as Jonathan Lucroy or Stephen Vogt. \nProspect to watch \nPedro Severino’s development will be key because of Ramos’s upcoming free agency. The 22-year-old reached the majors this season for the first time as a September call-up. In very limited action, he showed flashes of his defensive skill and youth. His English has improved a lot each year and he possesses the personality to grow into a leader of a pitching staff behind the plate. \nSeverino’s progress with his bat will be something to watch. He hit .246/.288/.331 with five home runs, 34 RBI, 51 strikeouts and 19 walks in 91 games at Class AA Harrisburg. Despite the low numbers, Nationals officials were pleased with some of the growth and adjustments he made this season. Defense has always come more naturally to Severino but his offense requires more work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:36:08.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
