Strong agreed when asked if it was his worst day as a head coach.\n\"Oh, it is,\" said Strong, who expected far more from his team. \"I just felt the way we played the last two weeks, we would come in and compete and come in and play.\"\nBut after two losses by a total of four points to California and Oklahoma State, the Longhorns trailed 30-0 after the first quarter.\nWhile Texas was struggling, No. 15 Oklahoma took care of No. 23 West Virginia 44-24 in Norman. The Sooners are getting big plays all over the place, from All-American linebacker Eric Striker to Texas Tech transfer quarterback Baker Mayfield. Players such as Jordan Thomas and Jordan Evans stepped up against the Mountaineers.\n\"There were a lot of guys making plays,\" Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said.\nOff to its worst start since 1956 at 1-4, Texas is still searching for someone.\n\"You're missing that key guy, somebody who can take the team and take the team over,\" Strong said. \"We don't have that key guy. We've got to find that guy, and if not we've got to continue to develop it.\"\nWhile he backed Strong, senior linebacker Peter Jinkens offered no comment when asked about the leadership comment.\nHow bad was Saturday? During the TCU game, the Texas Rangers' official Twitter account posted \"Fire Charlie.\"\nYes, in the middle of a pennant race.\nThe Rangers quickly issued a statement apologizing for the \"very inappropriate and insensitive message.\" The team said that the social media department member who was responsible had been dismissed. The tweet still lingered on screen grabs across the Internet.\nThat wasn't the only social media problem.\nA retweet from the Twitter account of freshman defensive back Kris Boyd at halftime suggested that Boyd and freshman linebacker Malik Jefferson transfer to Texas A&M.\n\"Our players should never be on their phones at halftime,\" Strong said.\nFreshman quarterback Jerrod Heard said, \"Kris has a lot of heart and will speak his mind whenever he needs to.\"\nBut trailing 37-0 wasn't the best time to endorse switching schools.\nIn four of its last seven games dating to last season, Texas has lost by at least three touchdowns.\nGoing back to Thanksgiving 2014, Texas has been outscored 98-17 by TCU. The 43-point loss narrowly avoided making the list of Texas' 10 worst losses.\nAgainst that backdrop, a rendezvous with Oklahoma might come at the right time for Texas to refocus.\n\"It's a big game,\" Jinkens said. \"Hopefully, we're ready to play this game. It's a rivalry game in Dallas. We've got to just play.\"\nThe slow start and the lingering fan resentment over former athletic director Steve Patterson might even have taken a toll on the unique 50-50 fan split down the middle at the Cotton Bowl.\nLast month, Texas put about 8,000 tickets for sale in its section to the general public, a rare occurrence. By Friday, the number had dropped to 2,800 -- meaning there could be a lot of crimson mixed in with the burnt orange.\nOklahoma stampede Oklahoma has won four of the last five meetings with Texas in the AT&T Red River Showdown:\nYear Result 2010 Oklahoma, 28-20 2011 Oklahoma, 55-17 2012 Oklahoma, 63-21 2013 Texas, 36-20 2014 Oklahoma, 31-26\nTwitter: @ChuckCarltonDMN\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-04T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:38:49.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
