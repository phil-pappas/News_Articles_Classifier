DiLeo and Nicholas were four-year Hawks, while Kofane was a fifth-year senior who spent his first four years at Providence. That made for easy selections as captains, but this season, the only senior on the roster is fifth-year guard Deon Jones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:11:23.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
