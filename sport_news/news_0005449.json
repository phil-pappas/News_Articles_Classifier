Tom Coughlin loved watching his cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie pick off a Matt Cassel pass, but he wasn't in love with how Rodgers-Cromartie held the ball up high while Cowboys gave chase down the sideline before he scored.\n\"I tried to get him to not hold the ball up in the air with a guy running 4.3 behind him,\" Coughlin said. \"I just mentioned it to him and he agreed.\"\nRodgers-Cromartie completed his 58-yard catch-and-sprint to put the Giants up 17-13 during the third quarter of the 27-20 win. He also picked off a second Cassel pass, and gained 12 yards on that return. He noted that the turnovers helped a secondary taking shape despite injuries. He made his big plays after leaving the game with a bone bruise on a finger earlier. Trainers put a cast on it for protection.\n\"We have a reputation as just some scrappy little fighters,\" he said.\nTHE DARKWA KNIGHT\nThe dark horse in the Giants' tailback stable emerged for powerful runs.\nOrleans Darkwa, typically the third-string rusher, gained yards up the middle to help get the ground game going. He finished with eight carries for 48 yards. His longest breakthrough came on a 15-yard burst for a touchdown. Coughlin maintained afterward it was a planned move to charge the offense.\n\"He certainly did look good,\" Coughlin said.\nThe coach called his scoring run \"an outstanding play.\"\nLESS IS MORE\nPass rusher Damontre Moore didn't play and Coughlin isn't saying why.\n\"That's between me and him,\" Coughlin said.\nSix days after Moore was flagged for a roughing-the-passer against the Eagles, he was on the inactive list for the Dallas game. Last week, Coughlin noted that \"trust\" was an issue now with the team's sack leader because he slammed Philadelphia quarterback Sam Bradford to the ground for the costly penalty.\n\"There's absolutely no excuse,\" Coughlin said.\nVeterans Robert Ayers and George Selvie suited up, and second-year man Kerry Wynn has established himself. Moore may be left to battle rookie Owa Odighizuwa for playing time throughout the rest of the season.\nAyers was evaluated for a possible concussion in the third quarter, but he returned and almost collected a sack. Odighizuwa left the game in the third quarter with a hamstring injury.\nINJURY UPDATE\nGiants LB J.T. Thomas (ankle) was questionable to return in the fourth quarter…Dallas RB Joseph Randle rushed twice for 24 yards, but a back strain sidelined him in the second half.\nIT’S GOOD\nJosh Brown's 47-yard field goal in the second quarter was his 18th consecutive field goal, breaking the Giants' team record previously held by Brown.\nRelated Stories Vacchiano: Giants don't let mistakes of past haunt them Dwayne Harris sparks Giants in win over Cowboys Giants get their revenge on Cowboys, win key NFC East game Instant analysis: Giants defeat Cowboys, 27-20", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:11:12.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
