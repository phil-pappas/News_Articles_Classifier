(AP Photo) Comments \nHazel Mae of Sportsnet was trying to interview Toronto third baseman Josh Donaldson in the joyous Blue Jays' locker room on Wednesday night when beer and happy teammates kept getting in the way. \nThe Blue Jays were celebrating clinching the American League East championship in the visitors' locker room at Camden Yards in Baltimore. With four days remaining in the regular season, Toronto defeated the Orioles 15-2 on Wednesday to lock up the title. \nDonaldson was a baseball and football star at Faith Academy in Mobile before playing baseball at Auburn . \nThe Blue Jays traded four players in the offseason to acquire Donaldson from the Oakland Athletics in the offseason. He leads the American League with 123 runs and 124 RBIs this season. \nBy winning the AL East for the first time since 1993, when the Blue Jays won the second of their back-to-back World Series titles, Toronto secured a place in one of the two AL Division Series. The Blue Jays will play the winner of the AL wild-card game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:24:00.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
