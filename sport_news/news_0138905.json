The reason why is explained in the voicemail, left last spring by a Maine senator, telling the Capuano family that their son had been granted a congressional nomination for an appointment at the Naval Academy.\n“It’s something he’s always wanted to do, protect the country,” Capuano told The Post in a quiet moment during practice this past week. “He has always embraced any challenge put in front of him, either physically or mentally. When I’m asked about the situation of my son being at Naval Academy, the main thing is it’s an honor, a privilege and a tremendous opportunity.”\nIt’s unusual to get a bit of sentimentality out of Capuano, 49, now in his fifth full season behind the Isles’ bench and typically all business while running his team. But ask him about this coming trip to Annapolis, Md., where he is taking his Islanders for a team-building three-day stay starting Monday, and his personal life suddenly comes a little more into focus.\nCapuano will get to have lunch with his son, whom he has talked to sparingly over the past few months and hasn’t seen since he and his wife, Donna, dropped Anthony off for the difficult and veiled “plebe summer.”\n“I think it’s different for his mom,” Capuano said. “There is always that hesitation when you send your child into a new situation, but when you see the respect and honor that are associated with everything they do at the academy, you know that there is no better place for Anthony. For both of us, as parents, we know that this has always been a goal of his, so we’re very proud. You realize the magnitude of what he’s doing when you drop him off on ‘I’ day. You get there and can see immediately it’s sacred ground.”\nJack Capuano Photo: Paul J. Bereswill Even more rare than the son of a NHL coach choosing to serve in the military, Anthony also abandoned his scholarship to play Division I baseball for University of Maine. Coming out of high school, he went up to the campus in Orono and was redshirted as a freshman. He knew the whole time he felt a calling in another direction, and he finally began to listen.\nThen came the arduous application process, and eventually that phone call telling him he had been accepted.\n“I definitely miss playing baseball, but at a certain point last year I took a step back and asked myself where I wanted to be in five years,” Anthony emailed from Annapolis. “I pictured myself as an officer in the military and realized the service academy was the best possible route for me to achieve my goal.”\nInstead of trying out for the baseball team, Anthony has gone back to playing hockey. For the first time since his sophomore year of high school, he joined a team — this time the Midshipmen’s club team — because he knows he will be with the same group of teammates for all four years, and that’s what matters most to him about the experience.\n“The sport of hockey has always been a part of my life and I missed being on the ice,” he said. “The opportunity to play again was something that I thought I had given up when I chose to focus on baseball.”\nAnthony remembered the times as a kid when his father was traveling as a coach, trying to break into the big leagues. After a six-game NHL career as a defenseman coming out of the University of Maine, Capuano started coaching in the ECHL in 1996, when Anthony was 2 years old. He went from Tallahassee, Fla., to Knoxville, Tenn., to Florence, S.C. He broke into the Islanders system in 2005 as an assistant coach, then moved to AHL Bridgeport as the headman for four-plus seasons before taking over in the middle of the 2010-11 season.\n“I feel with my dad being gone during the hockey season,” Anthony said, “it made me grow up a little faster than some of my peers.”\nIt’s the same mature attitude, the one of responsibility and the value of teamwork, that Capuano wants to instill in his young Islanders team, striving to make the playoffs for the third time in the past four years. For emphasis, they will be brought to Annapolis, where the coach’s son resides as a sterling example.\n“We’re proud of him,” Capuano said. “He’s a very disciplined and structured individual with everything he does.”\nCapuano paused just long enough to take sip of black coffee, then added: “He’s earned everything that he’s gotten.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under jack capuano ,  new york islanders", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:41:39.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
