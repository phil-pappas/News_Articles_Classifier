Only the two finalists get automatic berths.\nThat put the Philippine boxing team to square one as it begins another campaign to send a boxer to the Olympics.\nLadon’s loss came after welterweight Eumir Felix Marcial bowed to world No. 1 Daniyar Yeleussinov of Kazakhstan in the quarterfinals.\nIn Marcial’s weight class, a bronze medal would have earned at least a box-off with the other bronze medalist for third Olympic berth.\nCuban boxers dominated on the opening night of semifinals with three fighters progressing to the finals.\nLight-flyweight (46-49kg) Joahnys Argilagos, middleweight (75kg) Arlen Lopez and heavyweight (91kg) Erislandy Savon all breezed through to the finals with only compatriot light-welterweight Yasniel Toledo Lopez failing on Sunday.\nLopez and Savon were particularly impressive and will take some stopping in their finals.\nThe powerful Lopez brushed aside Egypt’s brave but well-beaten Hosam Abdin in possibly the noisiest bout of the night, with both fighters cheered on by a large number of supporters from their own country in the Ali Bin Hamad Al Attiyah Arena in the capital, Doha.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:56:37.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
