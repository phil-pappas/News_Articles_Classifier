Any time any of us had ever been around him -- I'm sure so many people have the same type of stories -- you always feel better when you leave a conversation or an interaction with Lamar.\"\nOdom spent the 2003-04 season with the Heat, after being signed away from the Los Angeles Clippers as a free agent. He then was dealt the following offseason to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade package for Shaquille O'Neal. His arrival to South Florida was part of the franchise's rebirth, with the Heat going from 25 victories the season before his addition to the second round of playoffs in 2004, with a team that featured Odom, Wade, Udonis Haslem, Caron Butler, Eddie Jones and Brian Grant.\nBut Wade said it was about more than winning when it came to the impact Odom had on himself and Haslem, who were rookies at the time.\n\"He was like 23 when we got here and he was a veteran for us,\" Wade said. \"You come in, you watch a guy playing with the Clippers and he's so cool, he's so talented, you've heard about him since he's been young. When he was young, you heard about him in college, etcetera. And then he's cool.\n\"And then he has an effect on you by his knowledge. And everyone knows that L.O. has so much knowledge about life and the game. And he put that on us, as young guys, and it stuck. And it stuck. And it will always be a part of me.\"\nHaslem was ill and missed Thursday's media availability at AmericanAirlines Arena, but had posted a poignant message about Odom a day earlier on his Instagram account.\nWade said his most recent conversation with Odom was after last season's NBA Finals in June, when Wade had served as an ABC analyst.\n\"And I'm like a little kid every time I get a chance to talk to him, like a rookie all over again,\" Wade said. \"We were talking about those moments. We were talking about him with his push to try to get back into the NBA. It's a lot of different things.\"\nSpoelstra had to pause several times while discussing Odom.\n\"It's hit all of us,\" he said. \"I think it's time for the entire NBA family to give back and give our thoughts and prayers, and kind of positive group-think to him right now.\"\nWade said to appreciate what Odom has been through is to appreciate his humanity, no matter the stories of drug abuse and other personal issues that have surfaced.\n\"You never know what a guy is going through,\" he said. \"We all think we know. No one knows what individuals are dealing with, especially someone who is deemed as successful and had the whole everything in the world, you think that their life is perfect. But he's not a person who put their burden on you.\"\n(c)2015 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1738476&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1738476", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1738476&h=Wade%2C+Spoelstra+say+Odom+always+be+a+part+of+them%2C+Heat"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:04:27.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
