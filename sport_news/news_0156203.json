At this point, I simply want to get healthy and back to my normal daily routine on and off the court.\"\nThe Warriors, who clinched a fourth NBA title for the franchise with a 4-2 series victory over Cleveland in June, open their 2015-16 regular season on Oct. 27 at home against the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\"At this point, the most important thing is to make sure Steve is healthy, completely recovered and ready for not only the rigors of a long NBA season, but day-to-day life in general,\" said Warriors general manager Bob Myers.\n\"We don't anticipate the recovery process will be long term, but as of today we don't know the exact time frame.\"\nLuke Walton, Golden State's lead assistant coach, will serve as interim head coach in Kerr's absence.\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Frank Pingue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:36:11.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
