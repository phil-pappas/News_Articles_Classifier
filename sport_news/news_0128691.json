If that time is not now, it may be soon. \nEvidence of lascivious recruiting practices in the University of Louisville’s basketball program reached critical mass Tuesday morning with ESPN’s Outside The Lines corroborating many of the claims of “escort queen” Katina Powell. That none of that evidence has been traced directly to the head coach is an important point in Pitino’s favor. \nYet as damning allegations become more difficult to deny, as investigators accumulate eyewitness testimony and plumb paper trails and, more broadly, as the university becomes synonymous with a multi-year and staff-orchestrated sex scandal, Pitino’s ability to lead is compromised and his continued presence doubles the difficulty of changing the subject. \nAsked Tuesday morning if Pitino could survive, a ranking U of L source replied, \"Probably. But it is going to be tough.\" Gauging public reaction and media posturing, it looked that much tougher Tuesday afternoon. \nHow much Pitino knew or should have known and when he knew or should have known it are all legitimate areas for inquiry. But even if Pitino was blindsided by allegations a former player subsidized sex parties, this does not excuse his lack of oversight or the lapse in judgment that placed former staff member Andre McGee in a position to expose the university to ruinous risk. \nNor is the issue so narrow or so trivial that athletic director Tom Jurich can expect to insulate Pitino from the fallout. Jurich carries a lot of weight in this town, and deservedly so, but having stood by Pitino in the face of the Karen Sypher mess, having rehired Bobby Petrino in the wake of his ugly exit from Arkansas, having kept football assistant Clint Hurtt despite an NCAA show-cause penalty, he can no longer expect an unlimited length of rope. Armour: Pitino has to go as Louisville sex scandal details emerge \nYou reach a point in these matters where a man realizes he has lost his mandate, where pragmatic considerations become more crucial than culpability. Though Pitino has said resigning would be cowardly, and Jurich said Tuesday his Hall of Fame coach has no plans to step down, the chorus demanding change will grow louder as the investigation goes longer. \nIf Jurich and University President James Ramsey lack the will to remove Pitino after all of his success and contributions, Pitino may eventually feel compelled to spare them that pain and offer to negotiate a settlement. Much as his instinct might tell him to stay, he has to know that the end of this sordid saga is nowhere in sight and that additional revelations may bring additional embarrassment. \nAs Powell’s co-author, Dick Cady, told ESPN, evidence that McGee continued to supply strippers at Billy Minardi Hall after he took a job at the University of Missouri-Kansas City raises questions about the scope of the operation and the possible involvement of others in the basketball program. Why would McGee get involved in the recruitment of players for a school he had left unless he was asked to do so by a former associate in need of his carnal connections? Louisville AD: No plans for Rick Pitino to step down \nPerhaps there’s an answer to that question that would not implicate someone else who answers to Pitino. Perhaps McGee was paying the strippers/hookers out of his own pocket and not recouping his costs somehow. And perhaps the statement Chane Behanan posted Tuesday, conspicuously short on denials, was less of an admission than an omission. \nThough there are still some U of L fans who won’t be satisfied until everyone named in Powell’s book confesses on a chapter-and-verse basis, anyone with an ounce of objectivity should be convinced by now that some serious infractions occurred in this case and that the NCAA is sure to impose significant penalties if Louisville does not self-impose them first. \nFormer U of L star Terry Rozier, identified by Powell as one of the players who made use of her services, danced around the specifics of his involvement in an ESPN interview, but he took pains to paint Pitino as a victim of circumstances beyond his awareness. \n“As far as the dorm situations and visits, he’d go out to eat with the recruits and their parents,” Rozier said. “As far as after that, he wouldn’t know. ... I can say his nose is clean.” \nThere may be some comfort in that, but not much. 2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1LLgjcM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:07:19.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
