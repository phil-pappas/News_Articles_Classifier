New York has now beaten the top two pitchers in the Cubs rotation, while holding the Cubs biggest hitters almost completely silent.\nTo change that, Anthony Rizzo is again hoping a raucous Wrigley Field crowd will bring the team to life.\nTough losses but 3 games in front of the best fans in baseball coming up. Show your pride tomorrow by wearing Cubs gear. (1/2)\n— Anthony Rizzo (@ARizzo44) October 19, 2015\nRizzo sent out a similar tweet before the Cubs returned to Chicago in the NLDS, challenging Cubs fans to get loud.\nThe Cubs now need to win at least two out of the three games coming up at Wrigley Field. They need four of the remaining five in the series to advance.\nRizzo isn’t the only high profile person expecting Cubs fans to shake things up in the series. Longtime Cubs fan and actor John Cusack hasn’t lost his confidence in the team and will try to help get Wrigley as loud as possible.\nNyC held serve -Cubs come home – 1st to 4 – the boys will battle back! let's go wild in Chicago !!\n— John Cusack (@johncusack) October 19, 2015\nIn the end, it will be the players on the field who make the difference for the Cubs. Rizzo has been stuck in a 1-8 stretch in the NLCS, he’s 4-26 on the postseason. Two of those hits, however, were Wrigley Field home runs in the NLDS.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johncusack/status/655951187661991937", "https://twitter.com/ARizzo44/status/655959678522904577"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:51:40.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
