The unit keeps bait fish alive and healthy. This ensures that bait fish offer more effective presentations. The invention increases the chances of making a successful catch. Additionally, it makes fishing trips more productive and enjoyable.\nThe original design was submitted to the Toronto office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
