(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) ORG XMIT: OTK (Wilfredo Lee / AP) Find out what happened with Flyers goalie Steve Mason \nPHILADELPHIA – Just two games into the season and the Flyers' season is already having its fair share of drama. \nOn Monday morning, the team announced that starting goaltender Steve Mason would not be available hours later for the home opener against the Florida Panthers. \nGeneral manager Ron Hextall would only say that Mason has a personal matter involving his family and would not divulge any other information about the nature of the issue. \nIn Mason's place, backup goalie Michal Neuvirth will get his first start as a Flyer. \nAlso on Monday morning it was announced that team chairman Ed Snider will not be attending the home opener because he is home in California, resting after receiving medical treatment for an undisclosed condition. \nOn top of all this, the Flyers (0-1-1) were trying to secure their first win of the season in a game Hextall termed \"critical.'' \nAs for Mason, Hextall would not say how long the netminder is expected to miss action but disclosed that he didn't think it's going to be a long-term absence. \n\"It's a sensitive issue,'' Hextall said. \"We're not going to have any more comment on it.'' \nSnider almost never misses a home opener, so that set off a few bells. \nBut a Flyers' public relations person said Snider told him he feels fine, \"fantastic,'' and was excited about the team's season-opener in Tampa. \n\"I talked to him and as far as I know, he's doing well,'' Hextall said. \"He was in a good mood and I think everything is fine. He was excited about our first game (a 3-2 overtime loss in Tampa) and I said I've never heard you happy after a loss.'' \nAnd after the second game? \n\"He wasn't quite as happy,'' Hextall said to a chorus of laughter. \nHextall acknowledged that the rematch game against the Panthers is important because the Flyers don't want to continue a three-year trend of slow starts. \n\"Tonight's critical,'' he said. \"If we win tonight, we're .500 and things have been OK. We were happy with our first game, not very happy with our second. \n\"When we get down four goals, it's tough, but I thought our guys continued to play hard. Did we play a great game? No. Did we get so discouraged we stopped playing? No. So there were some good signs out of it. We have to be better tonight. . .it's a critical game.'' \nCoach Dave Hakstol decided to give forward Sam Gagner a chance and the same went for defenseman Radko Gudas. \n\"I think Sam will go in and do a good job,'' Hakstol said. \"He brings good offensive ability. He will have a role for us on the power play. And I think everyone is confident that he can step in and help us.'' \nNeuvirth, who mopped up after Mason in the Florida game, said getting notified on short notice is no big deal. \n\"It's obviously sad news (about Mason),'' Neuvirth said. \"But we have a business to do. I just did my regular routine like on game day. I'm ready to go. \n\"It was good to see some action (in Florida). I think it's going to help me to be more relaxed for sure. \nAlso, R.J. Umberger is sidelined for Monday night's game with an upper-body injury suffered in Saturday night's 7-1 loss at the Panthers. Sam Gagner will step into his spot on the Scott Laughton-Matt Read line. \n\"We were hoping (Umberger) could play today,'' Hextall said. \"But he's day-to-day.'' \nHakstol announced that Gudas will make his Flyer debut and Luke Schenn will go to the bench. \nJagr still productive: No one has to tell the Flyers that Jaromir Jagr is still, at age 43, productive. Jagr scored a pair of goals in Saturday night's game. \nHe says he plans to play hockey until he's 50 – maybe not in the NHL but probably back in Europe somewhere. \n\"I know I'm going to play until 50 if I don't get injured,'' Jagr said. \"I never said I was going to play here until I was 50. It's a different story.'' \nJagr said it gets increasingly hard to compete for a job in the NHL because the competition is so intense among the young players. \n\"They know that training camp is their playoffs,'' he said. \"They're getting ready three months before training camp starts. They have to play their best hockey then. It's different for the older guys.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:53:10.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
