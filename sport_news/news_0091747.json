(AP) - Louisiana is moving ahead with plans to divert the Mississippi River's sediment and freshwater below New Orleans.\nOn Wednesday, the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, a panel overseeing coastal work in south Louisiana, voted to continue work on the Mid-Barataria and Mid-Breton river diversion projects.\nThe two diversions would flush sediment and freshwater into estuaries on the east and west sides of the Mississippi River in an effort to rebuild land. CPRA Executive Director Kyle Graham says 47,000 acres of land could be created over time by those diversions.\nAt the same meeting in the state Capitol in Baton Rouge, the CPRA voted to abandon two river diversion projects at the river's mouth. State coastal scientists had determined that those diversions would not create as much land as previously hoped.\n( )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:00:00.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
