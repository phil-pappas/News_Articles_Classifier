OCT. 2, 2015 The appellate court’s recent decision affirmed part of a federal judge’s ruling in the so-called O’Bannon case — that the N.C.A.A. broke antitrust laws by not allowing athletes to profit from the use of their images on TV and in video games. But it also ruled that the enhanced scholarships the N.C.A.A. approved this year and are worth an extra few thousand dollars were sufficient to remedy the antitrust harm. In a 2-to-1 decision, the appellate court threw out the deferred payments suggested by the district court that would have allowed colleges to pay athletes up to $5,000 per year.\nThe N.C.A.A. appealed the lower court’s decision to the Ninth Circuit, but now the athletes’ lawyers are arguing that the appellate court acted improperly.\nThe Ninth Circuit has about six weeks to consider whether to accept the petition. If it does, an 11-judge panel will be convened to reconsider the N.C.A.A.’s appeal of the district court’s ruling.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/01/sports/01NCAAweb/01NCAAweb-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/nocera-circular/nocera-circular-thumbStandard-v2.png", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/30/sports/30obannon/30obannon-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/01/sports/01OBANNONwebSUB/01OBANNONwebSUB-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:43:20.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
