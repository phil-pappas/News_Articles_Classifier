Caption (Sarah Nader- snader@shawmedia.com) Terry Carroll of Algonquin pulls up a song he wrote about the Cubs on his computer at his home. By CHRIS MORDI – editorial@nwherald.com \nJust as long as the Cubs are playing Related Links \nI’ll be there and I’ll be staying \nAnd I swear my heart will never leave \nYeah I’ll be there and I’ll be cheering \nCubbie blue is what I’m wearing \nThis is where my heart’s worn on my sleeve \n– the chorus from “Just As Long As The Cubs Are Playing,” written and performed by Terry Carroll of Algonquin \nGlory and pain inspired Terry Carroll to combine his love of music and songwriting with his passion for the Cubs. \nHe wrote his first Cubs song, “The Cubs Are Gonna Do It,” in 2003. The Cubs had won the National League Central Division title and had racked up their first postseason series win since 1908, before losing to the Florida Marlins four games to three in the National League Championship Series. \n“That loss took us all by surprise,” said Carroll, of Algonquin. “It made the curse of the goat stand out even more. I just had to say how I was feeling, so I said it in a song.” \n(The “Curse of the Billy Goat” was placed on the Cubs in 1945 when Billy Sianis, then the owner of Billy Goat Tavern, supposedly was asked to leave the Cubs’ World Series game against the Detroit Tigers at Wrigley Field because his pet goat’s odor was bothering fans. He was said to have declared, “Them Cubs, they ain’t gonna win no more.”) \nSince that first song, Carroll has written 11 more songs about the Cubs. He writes all of the lyrics and music, plays all of the instruments and mixes everything together. Some of his songs can be found on Amazon.com under “ The Chicago Way by Terry Carroll .” \n“I love writing about the Cubs,” he said. “It’s my love, my mistress.” \nThe 59-year-old’s first memory of the team came in 1968, when he saw his father watching the Cubs on television. \nBefore that, he wasn’t familiar with baseball. That was the same year he first threw a baseball and played on an organized team. It also was the year he lost his father. \n“My father was very sick that year, so I was on my own to learn,” Carroll said. \n“You might say I was a bench warmer.” \nEvery year after that, he played sandlot baseball, “due to the lack of cash,” he said. \n“Being from a poor background, we moved around a little bit in Carpentersville,” he said. “Everywhere we moved, I hooked up with kids who were Cubs fans. There wasn’t a [White] Sox fan in the neighborhood.” \nAt the same time his love for baseball and the Cubs were growing, so was another passion – music and songwriting. \nGrowing up in a family of eight children, Carroll said he was an entertainer. \n“I remember being 10 years old walking down a lane and making up songs and singing them, walking down the lane,” he said. \nCarroll was never able to figure out where the music came from. “I always had songs floating around my head, but I never thought about [songwriting],” he said. \nThen he sang for the first time into a tape recorder. \nIt was 1976. “I thought, ‘Hey, that’s all right,’” he said. “That’s what keeps you going. You did it. Now you want to improve.” \nAfter that, he was hooked. \n“The first time you do it for yourself, and you feel great about creating it,” he said. “Then, someone says they like it.” \nThat was his inspiration to start learning how to play instruments and record music. \nCarroll said sometimes the songs take as long as a month to write. “I don’t give up on them,” he said. \nHe’s so inspired by the team that he tried out for a chance to perform at Wrigley Field as part of a contest to sing “Take Me Out To The Ball Game” during the seventh-inning stretch. \nHe didn’t make the cut. \n“That was as close as I got [to performing at Wrigley Field],” he said. \nHe might not have won, but the contest motivated him to write seven more songs about the Cubs. \n“I can’t get enough of writing,” Carroll said. \nWhen it comes to his inspiration, he declares 1984 as his favorite and most memorable Cubs year. \nIt was the Cubs’ first postseason appearance since 1945, after a 96-win season. Pitcher Rick Sutcliffe won the Cy Young Award, Ryne Sandberg won the Most Valuable Player Award and coach Jim Frey won Manager of the Year. \nIt also was the cruelest year. \n“My worst memory is watching the ball go through Bull Durham’s legs. It broke my heart a couple of times,” Carroll said. \nThe Cubs eventually were defeated in the 1984 National League Championship Series by the San Diego Padres three games to two. \nYet, like a true Cubs fan, Carroll kept looking to the future. And he still is, now more than ever, having started out the year believing strongly in the Cubs’ chances for a championship. \n“I think that the time is here,” Carroll said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:37:03.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
