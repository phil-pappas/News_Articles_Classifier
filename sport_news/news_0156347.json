Five top-10 teams await. \nThe first season after a coaching change is a time of adjustment that usually is filled with hard knocks. Of 14 Missouri State coaches before Dave Steckel, only four had a winning record in year one: \n•Walter Langston was 4-2 in 1909, the first year of football at what was then the Fourth District Normal School. Springfield High School, Monett High School and Aurora High School were opponents. Talk about the anti-Valley of 2015. \n•Howard Blair went 4-2-2 in 1938, Fred Thomsen 5-4-1 in 1949 and Jim Mentis was 7-3 in 1965. \nEven the man whose name once was on the football stadium until a remodel in 1991, Arthur Briggs, did not enjoy immediate success. His first team, in 1912, was 0-3 and outscored 293-0 including a 150-0 loss at Pittsburg State. That score is not a typo. \nJesse Branch, the only coach to lead the Bears to the playoffs in the Division I era, went 3-7 as he began in 1986. Three years later, the Bears went 10-3 and were league champs and in the FCS quarterfinals. \nAfter that brief history lesson, here are three takeaways from Saturday’s 56-28 loss to No. 24 Indiana State: \nIt’s tough being young: Winning teams averaged 34.6 points in five Valley games. Having 16 freshmen and sophomores on the defensive two-deep means there’s a lot of learning-on-the-job going on for the Bears and that’s hard against high-level offenses. \nSome hope: There were some shiny defensive nuggets, especially the pass rush. The Bears had a season-high six sacks, including two from promising sophomore end Colby Isbell who has the look of a future difference-making defender. \nNice returns: Bears’ special teams highlights over the years have been as rare as Bigfoot sightings. But they had two gems on Saturday, with Chris Sullens’ 38-yard run on a fake punt and Deion Holliman’s 58-yard punt-return touchdown. Of course, the Bears also surrendered a punt-return touchdown after a short Sullens punt in the first quarter so it’s a mixed bag. \nFirst-year MSU coaches", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:18:55.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
