By Eric Turner The Capital-Journal \nOnce again, Manhattan swept the team and individual titles at the Centennial League cross country meet, but Hayden’s Jacob Klemz and the Washburn Rural boys and Seaman girls teams posted solid runner-up performance Saturday at Felker Park. \nKlemz took another shot at the Hayden school recod, finishing second in the 5-kilometer race in 16 minutes, 6.05 seconds—a couple of seconds shy of the school mark of 16:04.9 he shares with John Etzel. \nManhattan’s Jackson Schroeder, the defending Class 6A state champion, ran away from a pack of four to cruise to a 28-second victory in 15:38.47. \n“I can’t complain about second,” said Klemz, who was third a year ago. “There were great racers in the race. We had a good little pack going for awhile, but we both decided it was a little slow for us, and we wanted to take off. \n“If that pack would’ve stayed together, it might have been a little quicker. But we had to break off, and Jackson ran a great race.” \nWashburn Rural’s Pierce Flanders outkicked Seaman’s Dawson Podlena down the stretch for third place. The Junior Blues had three in the top 10—Cason Cropp was sixth and Michael Knapp 10th—to finish with 68 points, a solid second behind Manhattan’s 41. \n“We’ll take it,” Rural coach Scott Schufelberger said. “Pierce is running a lot better race now. He’s getting into better condition and working pretty hard in practice the last three or four weeks. He doesn’t want to lose, and there’s competition between he and Cason. \n“It helps to have internal competition. There’s been years we didn’t have that, and it makes a difference.” \nInternal competition spurred the Seaman girls as Avery McCarter outkicked teammate Kaylee Snell by less than two seconds for third place behind repeat champion Cara Melgares of Manhattan, which had seven of the top 10 finishers. \n“Me and Kaylee really pushed each other,” McCarter said. “It was good competition. I was definitely racing Kaylee, and she definitely pushed me toward the end.” \nMcCarter and Snell both improved on personal best times set last week when they finished 1-2 at the city meet at Washburn Rural. McCarter finished in 19:21.80 and Snell in 19:23.41. Avery Bocquin was 15th for Seaman, which edged Junction City 76-95 for second place despite Katy Mulqueen—fourth at city last week—not finishing due to a knee injury. \n“Avery and Kaylee racing it again to the finish was exciting,” Seaman coach Rick Brading said. “Kaylee had her early on, and Avery got her right at the end. I’m convinced that’s good for both of them. Avery’s got the nod both meets but next week they’ll go at it again.” \nAnna Keeley was second and Madeline Purdom fifth for Manhattan. Topeka High freshman Abby Wagemaker was sixth, and Topeka West senior Brooke Province was 11th. \nAlisiara Hobbs was 16th and Tianna Arreguin 18th for Shawnee Heights, and Jaybe Shufelberger was 17th for Washburn Rural. \nRobbie Schmidt was seventh and Parker Ramirez was 17th for the Hayden boys. Colton Sturgeon and Jordon Jensen were 16th and 18th for Seaman, which was third with 82 points. Hunter Henderson led Shawnee Heights in 19th. \nBoth Manhattan teams won the Centennial League for the sixth year in a row. \nGIRLS \nTeam scores \nManhattan 23, Seaman 76, Junction City 95, Shawnee Heights 111, Washburn Rural 147, Emporia 161, Topeka High 181, Topeka West 199, Hayden 207. \nIndividual results \n1.
