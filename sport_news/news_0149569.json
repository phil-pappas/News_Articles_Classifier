It could be less than that amount.\"\nThat type of coverage has been available since 1990 to athletes in football and men's basketball, according to the NCAA, and has since been extended to baseball, women's basketball and ice hockey.\nMORE ON NCAA INSURANCE POLICIES Between 100 and 200 athletes each year utilize that insurance, Fisher said. \"And certainly Leonard, I think, if he comes back, would do so,\" Fisher added. \"The problem with that coverage — and the NCAA acknowledges this through their Director of Insurance — is that there have been very few payouts on those policies through the years.\n\"The reason is primarily that the policy, in order for it to pay, requires that the athlete be totally and permanently disabled from playing professional football. Most of the policies, in fact — I can't think of one over the years that didn't have this language — also require that that disabling injury come from a single discreet event.\n\"So the defense that's always raised in these cases is that, No. 1, they're not totally, permanently disabled from football — they can do something — and, second, that even if they are, they had a prior injury and that prior injury contributed to their disability, so the policy doesn't pay.\n\"And you can imagine that when a young man gets to be a junior in college and has played football since he was in Pop Warner or Pee Wee football or YMCA football or whatever he did, he's had an injury to almost every part of his body. So it's very, very difficult coverage to collect on. In addition to which, it only protects you in the event of a career ending, catastrophic injury.\"\nBlack, for instance, a likely first-round draft pick in 2010, never signed an NFL contract after suffering a knee injury his senior season against Alabama.\nThe former LSU standout, who started a school-record 53 straight games, ultimately sued his ex-financial planner for obtaining what proved to be an inadequate policy .\n\"Now, another form of coverage that has come up lately, and it comes up as a rider, which means it's a corollary or an add-on to the disability coverage, and that's loss of value coverage,\" Fisher said. \"In my opinion, loss of value is the far more important coverage for the athlete. Unfortunately, there are some restrictions on how you can go about getting it.\n\"One restriction is that you can only buy loss of value coverage to the extent that you have disability coverage. So, for example, if you'd like to purchase a $1 million disability coverage, you can only purchase a $1 million loss of value policy. And while those numbers may seem big to most people, for a top three (rounds) projected NFL Draft pick, these are very, very low numbers. Five million does not come close to covering the financial loss if Jameis Winston is not able to play in the NFL.\n\"The loss of value covers an athlete in the case that he suffers an injury and is not totally, permanently disabled, but his value in the league drops.\"\nOregon defensive back Ifo Ekpre-Olomu went from likely first-round selection to seventh-round pick last season when he tore an ACL during preparation for the Ducks' national championship appearance against Ohio State.\nEkpre-Olomu, now a member of the Cleveland Browns, is currently expected to sit out this season and seeking payment from his $3 million insurance policy .\nBut the 5-foot-9 cornerback would still ultimately find himself guaranteed of far less money — more than $8 million — than he would've been prior to the injury, according to ESPN.com sports business reporter Darren Rovell's projections during the NFL Draft.\n\"He hasn't collected money yet,\" Fisher said. \"That's another part of the problem with this is that almost always the young athlete has to hire an attorney to collect on these policies, and we've been very, very successful collecting on them. But this is not the type of insurance that should require someone to go out and hire a lawyer to get payment on. It shouldn't be that way.\n\"Part of the problem is that the NCAA does not, in my opinion, competently vet this policies. They don't look at them to ensure that they're getting fair coverage at a fair rate. They don't look at them to be sure that these athletes are able to collect on the policies in the event that they have a disabling injury. And I don't think they do a good job of educating the athletes and their families of both the options that are out there for coverage, the rate at which these policies are paid or not paid and what you have to do in order to get payment.\"\nSo, the availability of an insurance policy doesn't necessarily negate a players' risk of lost earnings and, Fisher said, \"well over 99 percent of the cases require an attorney's involvement to collect.\"\nFisher's concerns with the current system are in no way a suggestion that Fournette or any athlete shouldn't play a college season prior to his draft eligibility, though, or, for that matter, that any player interested in returning to school for another year shouldn't do so.\n\"He's obviously going to return,\" the attorney said. \"I don't see Leonard challenging the three-year eligibility rule, so he'll return next year. The question is going to be the year after. But I don't think it's my position or anyone else's to really weigh in on that topic. It's a very personal decision for each of these athletes.\"\nFOURNETTE RESPONDS TO WIDESPREAD ADVICE In fact, Fisher said, few if any athletes to return express regret as to having done so — even after suffering injuries.\n\"In all my years of doing this and the many, many athletes that I've represented, spoken to, advised — everything — I have not yet had one tell me that they regretted the decision,\" \"And remember the universe of athlete I'm working with are those have suffered disabling injuries. Not one has said they regretted the decision to come back.\n\"And in particular, I would talk about Marcus Lattimore on that point, because he had two very severe injuries. He gave it his all to make the NFL happen, and now he's back at South Carolina working, but Marcus Lattimore doesn't have a regret and is very, very happy that he went back to South Carolina and gave it a go, and that's been the universal opinion of every one of these kids.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/index.ssf/2015/06/ifo_ekpre-olomu_torn_acl_rehab.html", "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2012/03/19/239976.htm", "http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2015/07/browns_cb_ifo_ekpre-olomu_expe.html", "http://www.oregonlive.com/nfl/index.ssf/2015/10/former_ducks_star_ifo_ekpre-ol_1.html", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/draft2015/story/_/id/12803823/ifo-ekpre-olomu-oregon-ducks-cornerback-line-collect-3m-insurance-policy-falling-draft", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226642194&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false", "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/09/30/fournette-definitely-should-take-a-year-off-in-2016/?utm_network=twitter&utm_post=4332344&utm_source=TW%20%40NBCSports&utm_tags%20=srm", "http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/insurance/student-athlete-insurance-programs"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:50:21.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
