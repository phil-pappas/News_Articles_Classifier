The Dutch international had to be withdrawn after 81 minutes of the Netherlands’ European Championships qualification match at Kazakhstan’s Astana Arena on Saturday evening and scans have since determined the severity of the injury. Krul will now return to Tyneside for further treatment and rehabilitation and everyone at the club wishes him a speedy recovery.Following Krul’s injury, Freddie Woodman has been recalled from his loan spell at Crawley Town. The Magpies are currently bottom of the Premier League with only three draws from their opening eight fixtures. Manager Steve McClaren is under pressure after five defeats that included a 6-1 hammering at Manchester City last time out. Newcastle’s next league fixture is against Norwich City before the Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland a week later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:00:32.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
