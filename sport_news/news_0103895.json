In 2006 Maddon got his first full-time managerial job after 25 years in the minor leagues and as a major league coach and interim manager. His Tampa Bay team lost 101 games that year. Hammel made nine starts for those Devil Rays, going 0-6 with a 7.77 earned run average. By 2008 Maddon had Tampa Bay, now known as the Rays, in the World Series with Hammel in his bullpen for 35 appearances along with five starts. Hammel’s address has changed five times since those days — Colorado from 2009-11, Baltimore in 2012-13, the Cubs and Oakland in 2014 and back in Chicago this season. And of course this season he and Maddon were reunited after Hammel signed a two-year, $20 million deal to be the Cubs’ No. 4 starter. Wednesday, Hammel makes arguably the most important start of his nine-year big league career when Maddon gives him the ball for Game Four of the National League Championship Series against the New York Mets at Wrigley Field. After losing the first two games of the best-of-seven series in New York over the weekend, the Cubs can’t afford any hiccups on their home field. “Of my life?” Hammel said before Tuesday’s Game Three when asked if today’s start is the biggest he’s ever made. “Obviously the deeper you get into the playoffs, yeah, I guess you could say that they’re the most difficult in my life. “But honestly, I’m not really thinking of it that way. It’s the New York Mets versus the Cubs. I’m facing their lineup and they’re facing ours.” Hammel pitched Game Four of the Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals last week, but he lasted just three innings before the Cubs’ bullpen pulled out a 6-4 victory that put Chicago in the NLCS for the first time since 2003. “Like I said before, pressure is what you make of it, and I don’t know if you ... I honestly believe if I’m pressuring myself, I’m worried about the wrong thing,” Hammel said. “I’ll be prepared with my game plan, go back and watch what I did when I faced the Mets earlier this year and we’ll kind of go off that.” There was speculation that the Cubs might opt for Game One starter Jon Lester and not Hammel. But Maddon squelched that Monday — sort of. “We’re just going to play it straight as of right now,” Maddon said after Monday’s workout at Wrigley Field. “We haven’t thought about changing any of that. Page 2 of 2 - “You have to win X number of games to get there, and to push Jon to that point, I don’t think we want to do that. We refrained from doing that in the previous round and it played out pretty well. We’re going to do it again.” Playoff veteran This will be Hammel’s fifth postseason start. He’s never made it into the seventh inning. “Obviously the ‘W’ is the bottom line,” he said, “and whether it’s seven innings or three innings like it was for me last time, the game plan is to win. We’ve entrusted Joe with that ability to make the decision whenever he thinks it’s ready or whatever decision he needs to make at a certain time. That’s his job as manager.” Hammel has been a bit of a good-luck charm. He was traded by Tampa Bay to Colorado in April 2009, and the Rockies wound up in the postseason. He was traded by the Rockies to Baltimore in 2012 and the Orioles made the postseason. He signed as a free agent with the Cubs and was traded to Oakland in July. The Athletics played in the American League wild-card game last October. He re-signed with the Cubs and we know how that story has turned out so far. “I feel pretty lucky to be able to do that,” Hammel said. “The thing that I’ve noticed the most (about all of those teams) is with these teams they’ve all been really young, almost to the fact where you have to think about it as the guys on the team are so young they really don’t understand the magnitude of the situation that they’re kind of thrown into. They’re just out there playing baseball in the big leagues.” And in Biggest Game of His Life II, Hammel will be the guy they’ll be relying on Wednesday. — Contact Jim Ruppert: jim.ruppert @sj-r.com, 788-1549 or on Twitter @JRupSJR.
