That's what Packers linebacker Clay Matthews shouted at 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick during last week's game. He's right, but he also could've said: \"You ain't Colin Kaepernick from 2013, bro!\" Kaepernick has had a big drop-off from the guy that led the 49ers to the Super Bowl. In his last two games, he's 22-for-44 for 227 yards, no touchdowns and five interceptions. Now, he's up against one of the most surprising defenses in the NFL. The Giants are allowing a league-low 69.8 rushing yards per game, and they'll stack the box against Carlos Hyde. Yes, the Giants are allowing the most passing yards per game (316.2), but after this one's over, that number will fall faster than one of Kaepernick's incompletions. Eli Manning threw five interceptions in a home loss to the 49ers last season. He gets his redemption in this one. The Giants have led by double digits in the fourth quarter of all four games this season. Make it five, as they cruise to a third straight win.\nThe pick: Giants\nLOCK OF THE WEEK\nSEAHAWKS (2-2) AT BENGALS (4-0)\nTV: Ch. 5; Radio: ESPN (98.7)\nBengals by 3; O/U: 431/2\nIn their last two games, the Seahawks forced their opponents to punt on 18 of 19 possessions. Those two opponents: Bears and Lions. They're not the Bengals. With Andy Dalton (9 TDs, 1 INT) leading the way, Cincy will move the ball against Seattle. Geno Atkins and the defensive line are going to have their way against an overmatced Seattle offensive line. Russell Wilson has been sacked 18 times in four games, and if you watched him dance out of trouble all night on Monday, he looked as if his pop star girlfriend Ciara taught him a few moves. Bengals defense dominates as Cincy goes to 5-0 overall and 5-0 against the spread (ATS).\nThe pick: Bengals\nBROWNS (1-3) AT RAVENS (1-3)\nRadio: WFAN (660, 101.9)\nRavens by 7; O/U: 43\nBaltimore saved its season with a comeback win at Pittsburgh, and now its reward is a cupcake at home against the Brownies. Joe Flacco is 13-1 straight up against Cleveland.\nThe pick: Ravens\nSAINTS (1-3) AT EAGLES (1-3)\nEagles by 5; O/U: 491/2\nEagles played three of four on the road, so maybe returning home could spark this offense. Eagles favored by 5? Vegas is begging you to take the Saints with this line. Don't fall for the trap.\nThe pick: Eagles\nRAMS (2-2) AT PACKERS (4-0)\nPackers by 81/2; O/U: 451/2\nIt's hard not to back Aaron Rodgers and Packers at home, but this is a lot of points against a strong, confident defense.\nThe pick: Rams\nBEARS (1-3) AT CHIEFS (1-3)\nChiefs by 81/2; O/U: 45\nBoth teams are 1-3, so why are the Chiefs such big favorites? 1) They're home. 2) Their last three losses were against Denver, Green Bay and Cincinnati, all 4-0. 3) They're playing the Bears. Ask yourself this: Is it more likely for Chiefs to win by two touchdowns or the Bears keeping it close? Chiefs score 30-plus.\nThe pick: Chiefs\nBILLS (2-2) AT TITANS (1-2)\nTV: Ch. 2\nBills by 2.; O/U: 421/2\nThese two franchises have produced two of the most memorable playoff games: \"The Comeback\" and the \"Music City Miracle\" Titans are home and off a bye, and with a week to regroup and digest his first three NFL games, Marcus Mariota's fresh legs are the difference.\nThe pick: Titans\nREDSKINS (2-2) AT FALCONS (4-0)\nFalcons by 7; O/U: 48\nAtlanta is due for a letdown after a 4-0 start. Washington's defense is allowing the second fewest rushing yards per game and will keep it close.\nThe pick: Redskins\nJAGUARS (1-3) AT BUCS (1-3)\nBucs by 3; O/U: 42\nJacksonville is probably still kicking itself after missed field goals at the end of regulation and overtime cost it a chance to be in first place. The Bucs have had their own kicking problems, but they're due at home. Lovie Smith (0-for-10) and Jameis Winston (0-for-2) kick the trend.\nThe pick: Bucs\nPATRIOTS (3-0) AT COWBOYS (2-2)\nTV: Ch. 2\nPatriots by 8; O/U: 491/2\nBrandon Weeden vs. Tom Brady. Should I keep going? OK, the Patriots are 11-4 straight up the week after their bye under Bill Belichick. Brady is 10-2 straight up vs. NFC East and 3-0 vs. the Cowboys. Weeden has lost his last 11 starts -- straight up and ATS. Dallas continues to lose key offensive players, and won't be able to put up enough points in this one to keep it close. The Pats continue their \"We're Going to Take DeflateGate out on the rest of the NFL\" Tour with another double-digit win.\nThe pick: Patriots\nCARDINALS (3-1) AT LIONS (0-4)\nCardinals by 21/2; O/U: 45\nThe Lions are the only winless team in the NFL, and they can thank the schedule makers, refeerees and poor play for that. Detroit became the latest NFC North team to be cursed by the corner of the Seattle end zone on a Monday night when a blown call cost them a chance at an upset win. Anger and frustration can motivate a team. I think Calvin Johnson makes up for his goal-line fumble with a mega performance. Lions find a way to win against a Cardinals team that showed last week maybe it's not as good as everyone thinks.\nThe pick: Lions\nBRONCOS (4-0) AT RAIDERS (2-2)\nBroncos by 41/2; O/U: 43\nWho knew Raiders fans were so clever. They've nicknamed the Amari Cooper/Derek Carr connection AC/DC. These two teams have shook me all season long: I'm 0-4 ATS picking Raiders games, 1-3 ATS in Broncos games. Denver's defense should give Oakland's young stars a real test, but I think this is one of those games when Oakland wants to prove it can hang with the class of the division. At times, their offense has been dynamite. More TNT as Oakland pulls off upset.\nThe pick: Raiders\nSTEELERS (2-2) AT CHARGERS (2-2), 8:30 p.m.\nTV: ESPN; Radio: WFAN (660, 101.9)\nChargers by 3; O/U: 46\nThe Steelers will have had 11 days to put that Ravens debacle behind them. I hope Mike Tomlin and his coaching staff realize they have one of the best backs in the league in Le'Veon Bell, and put the ball in his hands in crunch time. Both teams get a player back from a four-game suspension: Martavis Bryant for Steelers, Antonio Gates for Chargers. San Diego, which needed a last-second field goal at home against Cleveland last week, lost multiple players to injuries. Should be another field-goal game, so I'll take the points.\nThe pick: Steelers\nJoe Manniello 31-31-1, 3-1 best bets\nLast week: 8-7\nBob Glauber\nGiants Bengals Browns Eagles\nPackers Chiefs Bills\nFalcons Jaguars Patriots\nCardinals Broncos Chargers\nTom Rock\nGiants Seahawks Ravens Saints\nRams Bears Bills\nFalcons Jaguars Patriots\nCardinals Raiders Chargers\nKimberley A.
