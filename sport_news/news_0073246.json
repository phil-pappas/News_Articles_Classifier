Ray led the Warriors in rushing against the Dodgers. PHOTO BY CLINT COLE/DALLAS COUNTY NEWS \nBy Clint Cole \nSports Editor \nWaukee junior kicker Skyler Crew lined up for a 32-yard field goal to put the Waukee football team in the lead with under two minutes to go in the de facto Class 4A, District 4 Championship game against Fort Dodge on Friday, Oct. 16 at Waukee Stadium. The hold by Adam Rose wasn’t executed correctly, however, and the kick sailed wide keeping the score knotted at 28-28. \nCrew said that the ball was let go of too soon by Rose on the hold on the field goal attempt. \nOn the Dodgers’ next drive Rose picked off Fort Dodge quarterback Johnny Bice and set up a 27-yard field goal by Crew. This time the ball sailed through the uprights with eight seconds left on the clock and the Warriors went on to claim the District 4 Championship with a 31-28 win. \nThe Warriors (6-2, 5-0 District 4) ended the Dodgers’ (7-1, 4-1 District 4) run at an undefeated season. \n“We just knew that they had a lot of time left and that they were going to drive,” said Rose of the defensive stand after the missed field goal. “We called nickel and we just manned up. We had to make a play and that’s… what happened. That’s where the ball was. We got pretty lucky there.” \nWaukee coach Scott Carlson said that Crew hits field goals like that in practice every day and that’s what gave him the confidence to send him back out there for the game winner after he missed his first attempt. \n“He’s about as calm and cool a customer as you can get and, you know, it was kind of a tough spot for him on that first one,” said Carlson. “A hash kick is tough in high school football. They really spread you out and the angle is not as good as you’d like and all of that but typically he makes those anyway so I was a little surprise, frankly, that the first one didn’t go through.” \nEven after the bad hold and the wide field goal, Rose, who made amends by getting the ball back for the Warriors said he wasn’t worried on the second try. \n“It was a bad hold on my part the first time so I knew if I did my job he was going to do his,” said Rose. \nRose excelled on both sides of the ball. In addition to his interception on defense, he caught five passes for 106 yards and a touchdown to lead the Warriors in receiving. \nWaukee senior quarterback Ben Ferkin led the way on offense, completing 15-of-28 passes for 248 yards with two touchdowns and one interception to go along with 12 rushing yards on seven attempts (1.7 yards per carry). Senior Drew Lienemann caught the other touchdown pass from Ferkin and had two catches for 46 yards against the Dodgers. \nThe Dodgers also had success in the passing game. Bice completed 20-of-34 passes for 257 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. \nDaniel Ray led the Warriors in rushing yet again with 21 carries for 84 yards (four yards per carry) and a touchdown. Kade Penn had another strong game with five carries for 69 yards and a touchdown. \nThis season the Dodgers have been leaning on the talent of their workhorse running back, senior Sam Cook who had run for at least 100 yards six times and at least 200 yards five times going into the matchup against the Warriors. The Warriors held him to under 100 yards for just the second time this season. \nCook ran the ball 22 times for 69 yards (3.1 yards per carry) and two touchdowns against the Warriors last Friday while adding two receptions for 42 yards. \n“Obviously Sam is probably the best running back we’ll go against all season and you just try to get a lot of bodies to him, try to get a lot of people around him because he’ll break tackles pretty easily and you just want to have a lot of people there to help make the play,” said Rose. \nCarlson said that the Warriors didn’t contain Cook very well at first and that people attending the game got a taste of what he was all about in the beginning of the game. \n“I think we just had to settle to getting a look at him in person, seeing what he’s really like,” said Carlson. “You can’t simulate that, obviously, in practice and that helped our kids once we finally got settled in to the defensive side of the ball, we were able to slow him down a little bit in the second half.” \nThe Warriors had a hard time working around him when he was on the defensive side of the ball. Cook was the Dodgers’ leading tackler, recording 16.5 total tackles in the game, including two solo sacks. \nThe Warriors were led defensively by senior Cedric Dobbins, who had eight total tackles for the Warriors while fellow senior Nick Anderson had 7.5 and Jake Shutt had 6.5, including two solo tackles for loss. Dominic Baccam Lemvan and Jacob Wiggins each recovered a fumble for the Warriors against the Dodgers. \nThe Warriors wrap up the regular season on Friday when they head up to Mason City. The Mohawks have lost seven straight since winning the season opener against Clear Lake and are coming off a 30-21 loss at Indianola last Friday. \nThe game between the Warriors and the Mohawks begins at 7:30 p.m. at Mason City High School.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:52:30.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
