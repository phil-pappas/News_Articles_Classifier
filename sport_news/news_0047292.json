The left tackle was announced as being questionable to return, but didn’t. Marcus Cannon took his place in the lineup. After the game, Solder was asked if his injury has any long-term concerns. “Too hard to tell. We’re just going to go forward and see what happens,” Solder said. “That was a call they made. We’re going to go forward and see what happens because we haven’t made any conclusions yet.” Solder’s injury happened at a bad time for the Patriots. In the first half, the team struggled to protect Tom Brady, allowing five sacks. In the previous three games, they allowed six total. Greg Hardy (two sacks) was the biggest issue. He blew by Solder for his first sack. On the second, he victimized Cannon and strip-sacked Brady. In the second half, however, the Patriots were able to neutralize Hardy and the rest of the Cowboys’ defense and didn’t allow a sack. “There were some adjustments made and we just started playing better, too. We couldn’t play the way we started the game,” Solder said. “They did some different stuff and stuff we haven’t seen. We made some adjustments and kind of manipulate the things we were doing.” Even with the adjustment and second half effort, multiple Patriots offensive linemen said there’s a lot to improve upon. “I really don’t think I played well. There’s always room for improvement,” Cannon said. “There’s a lot of stuff out there that I feel like could have been better. I’ll watch the film, learn from it and correct it.” Added center David Andrews: “We just had to come in and readjust and go out there and play better. Just because we didn’t give up sacks, we still have a lot to work on. We’ll get back to work on Monday making our corrections.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:07:25.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
