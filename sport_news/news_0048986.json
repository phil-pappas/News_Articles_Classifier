But the defending champions are still without the injured Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta for the match against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. \n\"No one can replace Messi and there's no point trying to think that someone can fill Leo's place,\" Barcelona striker Luis Suarez said. \nVillarreal will stay in first place if it beats Celta on Sunday. \nHere are some things to know about this weekend's Spanish league matches: \nINJURY WORRIES \nMadrid has its own injury worries. \nWhile Benitez hopes defender Sergio Ramos will return from a shoulder injury, he will be without midfielder Luka Modric and striker Karim Benzema — who has scored more league goals this season than Ronaldo. \n\"We do great work preventing injuries, but we also have to play twice a week with great intensity,\" Benitez said. \"We have a lot of international matches.\" \nPEACEMAKER BENITEZ \nBesides worrying about the tactics on the field, Benitez is also dealing with a spat between two of his best players. \nIn a reference to Ronaldo, the agent for Gareth Bale said his client did not want \"to be the best model in the world or the best underwear seller.\" \n\"As coaches, we have to control a squad of professionals, but not what their agents might say,\" Benitez said. \"I speak to the football players and when a conflict might arise, it gets solved.\" \nCELTA'S CHANCE \nFresh off an impressive performance for Spain's national team, Manuel \"Nolito\" Agudo will be looking to help Celta take over first place in the league. \nAgudo has scored five league goals this season, the same as Ronaldo. \nIf Celta beats Villarreal, the team could end up in first place if Real Madrid and Barcelona fail to win. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:59:05.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
