However, the Panthers did not bite has they shut out the Bulldogs 28-0 behind three touchdowns by running back Chris Benson and a tough hard-hitting defense. Benson had touchdown receptions of 12 and 8 yards from quarterback Cameron Hall and also ran for another score from 16 yards out as part of his 129 yards rushing. The Panthers totaled 341 yards rushing, including a team-best 136 yards from running back Tyran Outlaw. Oddly enough, it was East Duplin’s second straight shutout – and the second straight game Dixon had been blanked. The Panthers (6-2, 2-0), who play host to Northside (6-2, 2-0) next Friday night, shutout Southwest 14-0 last week. Dixon (3-5, 0-2) was lost 27-0 last week to Northside. The Panthers opened the game with a 13-play, 67-yard drive in which they had to convert twice on fourth down to set up Benson’s first touchdown, a 12-yard pass from Hall for a 7-0 led with 6:15 left in the opening quarter. The Bulldogs brought a tough defense to the field as well and their ball control offense, which kept the Panthers from building on their lead until Benson found the end zone again on a 16-yard run up the middle in the second quarter to increase the Panthers lead 14-0 at the 6:25 mark. The Bulldogs got a spark late with 2:37 left in the second quarter when quarterback Brandon Horsely ran 35 yards up the middle of the Panthers’ defense and set the Bulldogs up with first-and-10 at the Panthers’ 30. That quickly became first-and-goal at the 9 with just 23 seconds left. But the Bulldogs missed on two pass attempts in the end zone as the half expired. “That was a big stop for us at the end of the first half,” East Duplin coach Battle Holley said. “We really could’ve let the momentum get away from us there, but we stepped up and made a nice stop to keep things going our way.” The third quarter started the same way the game started. After forcing the Bulldogs to punt, the Panthers ended another drive with a touchdown pass from Hall to Benson, this time from 8 yards away to make it a 21-0 Panther lead. The Bulldogs, who came in with three starters sitting out due to injury, had a difficult time moving the ball in the second half, picking up only one first down in the half late in the fourth quarter. “They are a very physical football team and that’s where we are trying to get to with out kids,” Dixon coach Chris Morris said. “They don’t do a lot of things, but the things they do, they are very good at. I told our kids after the game though, it’s about the little things. The little things are how you go from just being competitive, to actually being able to be a team like that (the Panthers). Page 2 of 2 - Holley was impressed with Dixon’s effort under is first-year coach. “Dixon is a good team and those kids play all the way to the end,” Holley said. “They make you play at their pace and they showed us we have some things to clean up before we play Northside. We can’t get away with some of the mistakes we made tonight against them.” Dixon 0 0 0 0 — 0 East Duplin 7 7 7 7 — 28 First Quarter ED – Hall 12 pass to Benson (Blizzard kick), 6:15 Second Quarter ED – Benson 16 run (Blizzard kick), 6:25 Third Quarter ED – Hall 8 pass to Benson (Blizzard kick), 7:21 Fourth Quarter ED – Scarborough 2 run (Blizzard kick), 8:20 D ED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:26:50.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
