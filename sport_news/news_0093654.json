The Tricolour was inaugurated by Vice-Admiral Anurag G Thapliyal, AVSM & BAR, Director General, Indian Coast Guard, on the occasion of the 44th Founders’ Day of Dalhousie Public School. A MiG-21 fighter aircraft is already installed on the school campus. Army Commander, Western Command, Lt Gen KJ Singh, AVSM, did the installation ceremony of the T-55 Russian Origin Battle Tank on the DPS premises as a war trophy on June 3 this year. The spot presents a spectacular view with the giant Tricolour fluttering in the backdrop of the MiG-21 fighter aircraft, surface-to-air Pichora missiles and the T-55 battle tank. DPS Director-Principal, Dr (Capt) GS Dhillon said here today that efforts were afoot to have a naval representation by placing a ship alongside the other war trophies. “National pride is a soldier’s ultimate pride and the display of defence hardware has a powerful motivational impact in joining the defence services”, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:25:14.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
