Gary Engberg: Fishing should be hot for walleyes and saugers on Lake Wisconsin GARY ENGBERG For the State Journal 5 hrs ago Associated Press archives \nFall is a great time to fish for walleyes and saugers on Lake Wisconsin. \nSAUK CITY -- For anglers trying to get in a few more weeks, or maybe a month of open-water fishing, before the freeze-up, sprawling Lake Wisconsin is a great location for chunky walleyes and saugers which are “bulking” up for the winter. \nLocated just 30 miles northwest of Madison, the 9,500-acre lake or flowage is good this time of year because its main forage base is gizzard shad and other minnows, which are concentrated just off the main river channel. Soon, the shad will be beginning their annual fall die-off. The walleyes and saugers gorge themselves on these schools of baitfish, which can become so thick that modern electronics can't even penetrate them. \nIt's not unusual for an angler to mark the schools on their locators, believing them to be in 15 feet of water, when in fact they are 25 feet deep. \nThe best locations to fish the lake are near the ferry and bridge crossing at both the Merrimac side to the north and the Lodi side to the south. Anglers should look for the baitfish or forage schools just off the old river channel in water 15 to 20 feet deep and sometimes even shallower. \nOnce you locate the forage (the walleyes will be close by), vertical jig those areas with a 1/4 to 1/8 -ounce jig tipped with a large fathead or chub about four inches long or plastic twister tails and ringworms if desired. Use a heavy enough jig so that you can keep tapping the bottom with your jig/minnow combo. \nIt is of utmost importance to be within a foot of the bottom for steady walleye and sauger action. The jig color doesn't seem to be that important, but chartreuse, orange, glow and black are always good colors for this lake. Hair jigs work extremely well, too, in the current because the flow gives the hair a pulsating action which walleyes find hard to resist. \nVertical jigging a blade bait (Sonar's or Zips) is another proven technique for the coming coldwater season. Lower the blade bait to the bottom and then rip them upward a foot or two and then allow the bait to fall naturally. This action triggers strikes which usually come on the lure's fall. Tipping blade baits with a minnow or a piece of a minnow is worth trying too when action is slow. \nWork the areas where you marked fish with your bow-mount trolling motor while keeping your line as vertical as possible. Being vertical and just off the bottom are the keys to catching these late-season fish. Action will continue until the water freezes sometime in December. \nThe recent cool-down will do nothing but improve the fall fishing as water gets closer to the annual turnover. Slow trolling long “stick baits” is another tactic that works later in the fall for walleyes. Troll slowly about 1 mile per hour around the points, humps, rocks, and on sand flats that are close to deeper water for both walleyes and saugers. \nBe sure to dress in layers, bring some hand warmers, and minnows of different sizes because some days the size of the minnow or plastic ringworm can make all the difference. \nWeekdays are best to fish because boat numbers are limited and you can have the lake to yourself. The best boat launches are at Sunset Bay and Okee where the piers are still in the water. \nContact Gary Engberg, a freelance outdoors writer from Mazomanie, at 608-795-4208, gengberg@chorus.net or visit him at http://www.garyengbergoutdoors.com.
