Ned Yost, Kansas City's manager, told reporters Sunday that he's not ready to name the group that will pitch against the Mets yet.\n\"Because I'm being a little bit of a punk,\" he said.\nWell, OK then. According to some expert estimation by the Kansas City Star's Andy McCullough, he expects Edinson Volquez and Johnny Cueto to start Games 1 and 2 at Kauffman Stadium, then Yordano Ventura and Chris Young in Games 3 and 4 at Citi Field.\nRELATED: Why Mets aces have met their match in World Series with Kansas City Royals Part of it may be to shield Cueto from pitching on the road. Why seems unclear for now.\nCueto has struggled on the road this postseason -- allowing eight runs in two innings in his start in Toronto in the ALCS after allowing six runs in 14 innings over two ALDS starts. But that's a small sample size and Cueto wasn't especially good at Kauffman Stadium this year. He had a 4.40 ERA in seven starts there after the Royals acquired him in July.\nThe Mets have announced their rotation already. They will roll out Matt Harvey in Game 1, Jacob deGrom in Game 2, Noah Syndergaard in Game 3, and Steven Matz in Game 4.\nNed Yost won't announce his rotation until tomorrow. Asked why, he said, \"Because I'm being a little bit of a punk.\"\n— Andy McCullough (@McCulloughStar) October 25, 2015\nYost won't tip his hand on the rotation, but it's likely to be Volquez, Cueto, Ventura and Young. Keeps Cueto off the road.\n— Andy McCullough (@McCulloughStar) October 26, 2015\nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com . @Mike_Vorkunov .
