Twenty-five NBA players and legends visited the facility, including NBA All-Stars John Wall, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose and Al Horford, while NBA coaches and trainers have held basketball clinics. \nThe school has won multiple national youth basketball tournaments, highlighted by its recent achievements at the CBA’s U17 National Tournament Championship and U13 National Championship. \nThe extended partnership with CBA Dongguan Basketball School builds on the NBA’s basketball and youth development efforts in China. In February 2014, NBA China and Yao Ming launched the NBA Yao Basketball Club to provide basketball training and fitness programs for boys and girls at all skill levels, while also using basketball to teach the importance of teamwork, leadership and communication. \nIn October 2014, the NBA launched a partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Education to further youth development through the implementation of basketball curricula in Chinese schools and NBA-branded public court refurbishments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:37:21.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
