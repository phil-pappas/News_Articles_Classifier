I think so,\" she said.\nSin pointed out that her team's findings do not prove that heart disease patients' positive outlook directly led to healthier habits. In fact, it's likely a two-way street, she said: Physical activity, for example, typically makes people feel better mentally and emotionally, as well.\nSo people who tend to land on the pessimistic side might start with small steps that could do their hearts and minds good, Sin suggested.\n\"Take a walk every day,\" she said. \"Have a conversation with a good friend. Take a moment just to think about what you're grateful for in your life.\"\nThe findings, published recently in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine , were based on surveys and physical exams of over 1,000 adults with heart disease.\nParticipants rated themselves on a standard scale of positive and negative emotions: They were considered to be more positive if they agreed that they were enthusiastic, determined, strong, interested and active.\nIn general, Sin's team found, those positive people were anywhere from one-quarter to 50 percent more likely to be getting regular exercise, sleeping well and sticking with their heart medications, compared to their less-positive peers. They were also less likely to be smokers.\nAnd when people's positive outlook increased over the next five years, so did their likelihood of adopting healthy habits, the study found.\n\"We can't say that positive emotions led to those healthier behaviors,\" Sin said. But again, she added, the important thing is that the two are connected, and may feed each other.\nMaddux agreed. \"Everything is so closely connected, there is no chicken and no egg,\" he said.\nTo be sure, a person's general disposition has a genetic component, Maddux noted. Some people are programmed to see the glass as half-empty, while others will naturally see it as half-full.\n\"But we also know that people can change,\" Maddux said.\nIf you have a chronic health condition and can't find the motivation to make lifestyle changes or take medications, that doesn't mean there's \"something wrong\" with you, according to Maddux.\n\"It just means you need more support,\" he said.\nHe suggested talking to your doctor about ways to overcome the obstacles you're facing. Support groups can also help, Maddux added, because you'll be around other people dealing with similar challenges.\n\"You can find some practical help with integrating these changes into your life,\" he said.\nMore information\nThe American Heart Association has more on healthy lifestyle changes ", "external_links": ["http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/", "http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/PreventionTreatmentofHeartAttack/Lifestyle-Changes_UCM_303934_Article.jsp#.Vh_SmKQhw-8"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:39:56.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
