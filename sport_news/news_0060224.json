Were they Swedish Olympians? Every time I got to a wrestling competition, if I was wrestling a Swedish guy I was preparing for the next guy,” said Cormier, who finished fourth at the 2004 Olympics. “That’s a bye. A Swedish Olympian is a bye in the Olympic Games.” \nIt’s reductive to reduce any fight to a clash between two skills, but it’s hard to classify Saturday night’s title fight as anything other than a showdown that pits Gustafsson’s elite striking against Cormier’s world-class wrestling. \nIn the ‘what have you done for me lately’ world of combat sports, most experts are picking Cormier to take the fight to the ground and keep it there. That’s largely because the champion’s wrestling was so on-point when he beat Anthony Johnson for the belt back in May at UFC 187, while Gustafsson’s striking failed him against Johnson when they faced off in Sweden back in January. \nGetting knocked out in the first round doesn’t generally lead to title shots for most fighters, but it did for Gustafsson. Part of what has riled Cormier is his belief that the Swede has been given a pass from both fans and the UFC as the result of his impressive showing in a loss to Jon Jones at UFC 165 back in 2013. \nAdding to Cormier’s frustration is the refusal by some fans to acknowledge the legitimacy of his belt. The champion earned the title after Jones was suspended indefinitely after he was charged for leaving the scene of a late-night car crash, and there are some who believe Cormier is just hanging onto the belt until Jones is ready to take it back. \nDefending his belt against the man who pushed Jones further than anyone would go a long way towards silencing his critics, and if he can do that without resorting to simply taking Gustafsson to the ground, that’s all the better. \n“It seems like Alex has gotten a lifetime pass, because whatever happened before or after that doesn’t matter,” Cormier said. “We continue to go back to that same night. \n“I can beat this guy in a standup fight ... I don’t have to take him down. He’ll figure it out very fast in the fight, as soon as they say ‘fight’ I’m gonna run up and clock him right upside the head and he’ll go ‘OK, I’m in a fight now’ and won’t be worrying so much about the takedown.” \nFor Gustafsson’s part, it obviously wouldn’t bother him too much if Cormier decides to try to stand and strike on Saturday night. He brought in a number of wrestlers to help prepare for Cormier’s takedowns, though, and -- like pretty much every fighter -- insists he’s comfortable wherever the fight goes. \nAs for the trash talk? Gustafsson’s been around the fight game long enough to know it comes with the territory. \n“I don’t pay attention to it, I barely even read it,” Gustafsson said. “I don’t even know what he’s been saying. \n“I’m on top right now, it’s never been better in my career ... Whatever he wants, I’m down for it. I’ll win every situation.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:24:23.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
