Fleming (1-2, 4-3) rallied from a 17-7 deficit in the third quarter. Creekside (0-2, 0-7) lost its 10th consecutive contest and had two chances late to win, but missed two long field goals within the last six minutes of the game. ... Sneed’s 10-yard run on the first play of overtime gave Fleming the 23-17 lead, but left-footed place-kicker Hakeem Reid — who kicked a 45-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter to tie the score at 17-17 — bounced his extra point off the left upright to give Creekside a chance to win. However, Creekside moved backward on its overtime possession from the 10-yard line as a fourth-down pass from the 22 was intercepted to end the game.
