He had surgery for a torn labrum in February. \nThe 22-year-old Profar played 12 games as a designated hitter late in the minor league season, hitting .256 with a homer and six RBIs combined at Class A Hickory and Double-A Frisco. \nWith Thursday's move, the Rangers have 39 players on their 40-man roster and three pitchers on the 60-day DL: Yu Darvish, Nick Tepesch and Alex Claudio. \nFirst baseman Kyle Blanks opted for free agency a day after getting optioned to Triple-A Round Rock.
