In the last few days, there are these signs...where any person or any point of view is not acceptable, then you resort to violence or turn intolerant towards them. \"This is a matter of concern for the nation. Democracy must ensure tolerance for a different point of view,\" Advani said. The senior BJP leader was speaking on the sidelines of a function where a journal on strategic affairs named 'Panchari' was launched. He, however, added that he did not have any information on who attacked Kulkarni as he is yet to communicate with him. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:11:55.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
