The day after telling Pat Murphy he will not return as manager of the San Diego Padres in 2016 General Manager A.J. Preller started the search for his replacement. This will be the first full-time manager Preller has hired as a GM. He knows what he's looking for, but is not yet sure who he's looking for. Video Woman Swims With Whale Shark 3 Miles Off San Diego Coast \"We'll look at candidates from all spectrums,\" said Preller on Monday. \"Successful guys come from all backgrounds.\" That means he'll be looking at previous Big League managers, guys with no managerial experience who have a proven track record as a coach or player, in-house candidates, people from outside the organization, Sabermatricians and old-school baseball types.

Preller says he's re-evaluating the process they used in looking at players to see how the front office can improve its performance. There is no time frame for when a new manager will be in place.
