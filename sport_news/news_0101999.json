CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBUCYRUS - Week 8 of Crawford County football produced some surprising results. \nIt had a team clinch a playoff spot, a team light up the scoreboard and a team pick up its first win since Week 3 of 2013. Overall, the county teams went 4-2 for the second straight week. Here's a recap: \nColonel Crawford 49, Buckeye Central 26 \nThis football game was better live than on paper. The Eagles and Bucks battled on the gridiron for the rights to Ohio 602 — the road connecting both schools by less than 12 miles. The Bucks fell behind 14-0 after the first quarter and it seemed as if the Eagles would run away with a dominating victory. \nThe Bucks then scored two unanswered touchdowns to cut the Eagles' lead to two after a failed PAT and two-point conversion. The Eagles then scored with just 40 seconds remaining in the half to make their lead 21-12. \nThe Bucks would receive the second half kickoff and march down the field to score and post a two-point conversion to bring the ballgame to within one. The two teams traded scores and with 4:25 showing in the third quarter, it was a two-point ballgame. \nThen the Eagles exploded for three more unanswered touchdowns to take home the 23-point win. \nThrough the back-and-forth ballgame, players handed in some incredible individual performances. Bucks quarterback Grant Loy showed why he is looked at as one of the top throwing quarterbacks in the area, completing 22 of 37 passes for 215 yards. He also was let loose in the run game with 114 yards and two touchdowns – combining for 329 yards of total offense and two touchdowns. \nPlayer of the Game: Eagles quarterback Will Kirkpatrick did his best to match Loy. More of a running style quarterback, Kirkpatrick ran for 296 yards and threw for another 108, finding the endzone five times on the ground and once through the air. \nStat of the night: Bucks cornerback Jeff Hall picked off Kirkpatrick and returned it for a 70-yard touchdown to bring the Bucks within two. The Bucks scored 12 points off Eagles turnovers. \nWynford 34, Upper Sandusky 7 \nThe Rams put a scare into the Royals, for one quarter. Then the Royals found a groove and never looked back. After the first, the Rams were leading 7-6 and putting up a good defensive performance. \nThe Royals then decided to see the Rams defense and raise them an even better performance and the Rams folded without much more of a fight. \nIt was a different kind of ballgame than what the Royals were used to. The ground game was unable to get the traction it did in previous matchups – see last week’s 550 yard rushing performance. In Week 8 the Royals were only able to grab 99 yards rushing, but took advantage through the air. \nZach Hoffman was 7-14 for 143 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for 19 yards and two more touchdowns. Nick Looker ran for 63 yards and a score. The Royals were able to clinch a playoff spot and now will play for the rights to host their Week 11 matchup. \nPlayer of the Game: Royals speedy wide receiver Tony Watson hauled in four balls for 94 yards and two touchdowns. \nStat of the night: The Royals defense gave up just 90 yards of total offense and, after a first quarter touchdown, shut them out the rest of the game. \nCarey 36, Bucyrus 0 \nThe Redmen continued their struggle of a 2015 in a shutout loss to Carey. The Blue Devil run game was too much for the Redmen to handle. Bucyrus gave up 203 rushing yards on defense. \nThe Redmen athletes continue to make progress though. Damon Parsell has taken the reigns at quarterback and looks to have secured the job for the near future. The sophomore completed 15 of 30 passes for 106 yards and ran for another 15 yards. \nUltimately, the inexperience and inconsistency has been the story for the Redmen throughout the season. \nPlayer of the game: Clinton Carr hauled in seven balls for 62 yards for the Redmen. The sophomore is just one for many Redmen players who will be returning next year with more experience. \nStat of the night: The Redmen defense forced four fumbles, recovering three of them. The Redmen offense did not have a turnover all night. \nCrestline 36, Fremont St. Joseph 22 \nThe Crestline Bulldogs found themselves in unfamiliar territory Friday night: the win column. It was the Bulldogs' first win since Week 3 of 2013. Hosting winless Fremont St. Joseph, the Crestline crowd was able to witness the streak ending. \nHeading into the halftime locker room down one, the Bulldogs regrouped and exploded for 15 points in the third and eight more in the fourth. The Bulldog defense gave up just eight second half points to help Crestline secure the win. \nJR Wolfe completed 6 of 15 passes for 84 yards and a touchdown. His strike to Davon Triplett started the scoring for the Bulldogs in the first quarter. Wolfe also ran for 78 yards and two touchdowns. Triplett ended the evening with 42 yards receiving. \nPlayer of the Game: J.C. Clark was a work horse for the Bulldogs. He carried the football 26 times for 132 yards and a touchdown. \nStat of the night: The Crestline offense piled up 302 yards of total offense and tallied four rushing touchdowns on the evening. \nGalion 70, Fairbanks 7 \nThe Galion Tigers are sitting on the edge of the playoff picture and they were hoping a blowout win against Fairbanks would earn them some style points in the computer polls. Step one was completed on Friday night when the Tigers hung 70 points on the scoreboard. \nThe Tigers never had to worry as they built a 49-0 lead by the intermission. \nDrake Barnett, Crawford County’s leading rusher, tacked on 190 more yards to his 2015 total and ran for three touchdowns. He also caught a 22-yard score. \nPlayer of the Game: Chase Cooke had a breakout performance last week and turned in his best one Friday. The junior quarterback threw for 200 yards and five touchdowns. \nStat of the night: The Galion defense picked off Fairbanks three times in the blowout victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:41:57.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
