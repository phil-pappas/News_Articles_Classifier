It is about things far, far simpler for the Ducks.\nScoring a goal. Winning a game. Staying employed.\nThe Ducks have an NHL-worst six goals and none have come from their five highest-paid forwards – Ryan Getzlaf , Corey Perry , Ryan Kesler, Carl Hagelin and Jakob Silfverberg . They’ve been shut out four times in their seven games, the same amount as all of last season.\nAnd with that, the Ducks (1-5-1) have only scored first in two of their seven games for the only leads they’ve enjoyed. The times they did it resulted in their only points gained, a 2-1 shootout loss to Vancouver in their home opener and a 4-1 win over Minnesota.\nHow embarrassing is their offense? Frederik Andersen’s 1.86 goals-against average has been wasted, his record 0-3-1 because his teammates have managed only one goal in his four starts.\n“It’s difficult when you’re not scoring any goals,” Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said Saturday after a 3-0 loss to Minnesota. “It’s the pressure every time you touch the puck. I’ve been there as a player and it’s not a fun time.”\nMostly, it has been about a team frustrated at its complete lack of offense. If the Ducks aren’t finishing the chances they create, they’re not creating many that they can finish.\nThe Ducks managed only 15 shots on Minnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk. No high-grade scoring opportunities were created after a first-period flurry by Getzlaf, Hagelin and Kevin Bieksa was turned away by Dubnyk and center Charlie Coyle in the goal crease.\nIt is the lack of persistence that is a troubling sign.\n“Even in the beginning of the games, I don’t think we really work hard enough to create scoring chances,” Andersen said. “And I think each and every one of us got to look in the mirror a little bit and see what they bring to the table.\n“Because it’s not good enough. We need to create more offensively.”\nThere is the growing speculation that Boudreau is on the hot seat. Ducks general manager Bob Murray joined the team over the weekend after a scouting trip. At the moment, Murray is being patient and, reportedly, is assessing his roster as well as his coach.\nA win against the Blackhawks – or against anyone – would be a step at cooling the speculation that surrounds Boudreau. But with every minute they don’t score and each defeat they take in comes with it increasing pressure.\n“I think it mounts,” Boudreau said. “Human nature would dictate that it would. When you do have chances and you don’t score, it’s even magnified more. Like I’ve said earlier, you’re holding the stick so tight and you can’t make plays. You see pucks bouncing off our guys’ sticks. You see them wanting to make the perfect play for a goal.\n“Whereas when things go bad, you just have to shoot everything at the net and go to the net and hope one bounces off your butt or something. And it gets in the net. That’s a lot of times what starts things.”\nAt some point, the Ducks have to score. There’s too much talent to not do so. And there’s a lot of money being paid out to those who do, for instance about $33 million this season to those five forwards.\nDoing it sooner than later would be a relief to everyone involved.\n“We’re desperate,” Getzlaf said. “I’ve never been in this to start a season. I’ve been through some things like this during a year. Can’t find a way to win games. Got to draw back on those things.\n“Find out the reasons why and what can we do to the change it. And I’ll try and build on that.”\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:11:55.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
