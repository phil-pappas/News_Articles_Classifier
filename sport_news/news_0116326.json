Here are some of the highlights:\nJoey Gallo seemed to really get exposed this last year after the first week or so of his call up. It seemed pitchers found the hole in his swing and he seemed pretty helpless to fix it. As a result, I feel a lot less confident about him than before. Am I making too much of this? Were our expectations too high?\nFraley: No, you are on the mark here. This season showed that Joey Gallo needs more development time. MLB ptichers found his weak spots and exploited them. It's natural to have high expectations for prospects, but it might be time to pull back on Gallo and give him time to grow.\nWill Mike Napoli return to the Rangers?\nFraley: Would say there is about a 95 percent possibility of that happening. It only takes one team, as you know, to change the dynamic, but Napoli is a good fit here. He likes it here, and the club likes having him. He's a productive bat against LHP and great in the room.\nWith little money to spend on free agents - past re-signing the ones they want to keep - how can the Rangers significantly improve this off season?\nFraley: This team has $. This is a big-market club, not Mayberry. You're right in that they cannot get in on Greinke, Price, etc., but there will be bargains this off-season. Keep an eye on Mike Leake, a free agent. Plus, they could trade a bat in Mitch Moreland. Cleveland has excess pitching and needs a bat. Not advocating a trade of Moreland, but he does have value.\nYou're the Rangers GM while JD is on vacation. What are two moves that you make immediately?\nFraley: Is free agent season open? I check out Ian Kennedy and Mike Leake to determine what it would take to sign them. I'm also on the phone with Justin Upton's agent.\nClick here to view the entire chat.\nOn Twitter:\n @gfraley", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/texas-rangers/chats/2015/10/17/gerry-fraley-answers-rangers-questions-11-tuesday-oct-20-ask-now?hootPostID=0413a130314681f979d1f1b56986b214", "https://twitter.com/gfraley"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:00:52.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
