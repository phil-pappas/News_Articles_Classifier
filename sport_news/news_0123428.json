Haffey/Getty Images LOS ANGELES - \nAdrian Gonzalez hit a go-ahead, two-run double during a four-run surge in the seventh inning, rallying the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-2 victory over the New York Mets in Game 2 of their National League Division Series on Saturday night. Related Content Deaths mar high school football season \nZack Greinke (1-0) won his seventh consecutive start, allowing two runs and five hits with eight strikeouts and no walks in seven innings as the Dodgers evened the best-of-five series at a game apiece before a sellout crowd of 54,455 at Dodger Stadium. \nGame 3 is Monday at Citi Field in New York. Brett Anderson (10-9, 3.69 ERA) will get the nod for the Dodgers and the Mets will counter with Matt Harvey (13-8, 2.71). \nDodgers closer Kenley Jansen walked right fielder Curtis Granderson before retiring three straight Mets in the ninth to nail down the save. \nMets starter Noah Syndergaard (0-1) struck out nine but was charged with three runs in the seventh. He walked four and gave up five hits. \nCenter fielder Yoenis Cespedes and rookie left fielder Michael Conforto homered for New York. \nDodgers center fielder Enrique Hernandez drew a one-out walk in the seventh and advanced to third on pinch-hitter Chase Utley's single to right. Hernandez scored on a fielder's choice off the bat of second baseman Howie Kendrick to tie the score at 2. \nUtley upended Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada on the play and was safe at second after an official review. Tejada was carted off with a fractured right fibula. \nGonzalez smacked a two-run double to right one batter later off reliever Addison Reed to lift Los Angeles to a 4-2 lead. Third baseman Justin Turner added an RBI double for a three-run cushion. \nCespedes led off the second with a solo blast to right for a 1-0 New York lead. Cespedes has at least one hit in 11 of his last 12 postseason games. \nConforto, who made his major league debut in July, ripped a Greinke fastball off the foul pole in right for a solo shot with two outs in the second for a 2-0 advantage. Conforto homered in his first postseason at-bat. Edgardo Alfonzo is the only other Met to homer in his first at-bat in the playoffs. \nIn the fourth, Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner opened the inning with a ground-rule double to left and scored on right fielder Andre Ethier's two-bagger to right to slice the deficit in half. \nNOTES: Mets INF Daniel Murphy, who tagged LHP Clayton Kershaw for a solo home run Friday, hit only one of his career-best 14 homers off a left-hander during the regular season in 126 at-bats. ... RHP Noah Syndergaard's 166 strikeouts this season topped all rookie pitchers in the majors. ... Dodgers RHP Zack Greinke pitched at least six innings in all 32 of his regular-season starts. ... The Dodgers have dropped Game 1 of a best-of-five series eight times since the advent of divisional play began in 1969. They have rallied to win a series twice, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1977 NLCS and against the Houston Astros in the 1981 NLDS. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
