Twilight Thursday post times will return, Rogers said, and the track will host a \"Downs After Dark\" evening Sept. 24.\nAt a Kentucky Horse Racing Commission committee earlier this month, a lawyer representing Churchill Downs and Keeneland argued that the all-turf boutique meet took away from fields elsewhere in the state. Kentucky Downs attracts large numbers and purses thanks to revenues from instant racing machines installed at the track.\nFor next year, Kentucky Downs also requested seven racing days, up from five in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:03:40.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
