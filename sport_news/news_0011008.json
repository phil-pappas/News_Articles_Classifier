JMU suffers first loss of the season on Homecoming By Richie Bozek | The Breeze The Breeze On Saturday afternoon — after about 12,000 people gathered from 9 a.m. to noon on the Quad of JMU’s campus to witness the live broadcast of “College GameDay” — No. 4-ranked JMU had its Homecoming game spoiled, suffering its first loss of the season to No. 11 University of Richmond, 59-49. “The bottom line, that team was better than us on offense than we were on defense today,” JMU head coach Everett Withers said. Saturday was the first time in program history that JMU (7-1, 4-1 Colonial Athletic Association) allowed an opponent over 700 yards of total offense in a game. Richmond (6-1, 4-0 CAA) posted 720 yards of total offense, compared to the Dukes’ 585 yards. The Dukes’ first possession of the fourth quarter cut Richmond’s lead to 49-42 with 11:18 left to play in regulation on sophomore quarterback Bryan Schor’s first career touchdown. On a 41-yard completion to junior wide receiver Brandon Ravenel earlier in the drive, redshirt senior quarterback Vad Lee came up from the pass limping. Schor stepped in three plays later to convert a fourth-and-two and score his first career touchdown on a 1-yard run on consecutive plays. Before injury, Lee was 19 for 32 passing for 294 yards and two touchdowns. Lee is now tied for first in program history in passing touchdowns with Justin Rascati (51). He also recorded 124 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 14 attempts. After the game, Withers said Lee’s foot injury is under evaluation. JMU conceded a field goal on Richmond’s next possession. Schor and the offense took the field again and produced a nine-play, 89-yard scoring drive that clipped the deficit to 52-49. Schor completed four of six passes on the drive for 73 yards. The possession was capped when Schor found junior wide receiver Rashard Davis from seven yards out with 4:02 remaining in the game. After the score, the record-setting 26,069 in attendance at Bridgeforth Stadium erupted, only to be silenced on the first play of Richmond’s ensuing drive. Richmond senior running back Jacobi Green broke through the left side of the defense for a 62-yard run. Three plays later, Green punched it in from one yard out and secured the Spiders’ 59-49 victory. “You take the night, reflect on [the loss] but you come back to work tomorrow and be ready to go,” JMU redshirt senior offensive lineman Austin Lane said. Green had a career day, running for 236 yards on 27 carries and scoring five touchdowns in Richmond’s win. Richmond head coach Danny Rocco said that Green, “knew he had to carry the load a little more … he certainly responded in a big way.” The Spiders jumped out of the starting gates early, putting together a nine-play, 75-yard scoring drive to begin the game. Green punched it in from two yards out to lift Richmond to an early 7-0 lead. The Dukes responded on their opening drive. JMU moved 54 yards down the field and found the endzone on a 15-yard reception by junior wide receiver Domo Taylor from Lee with 7:22 remaining in the quarter. Taylor leads the Dukes with five touchdown receptions this season. On the Dukes’ next possession, Lee clicked with redshirt sophomore wide receiver Ishmael Hyman three different times for a combined 41 yards on their way to another score. Lee ran it in from five yards out to give JMU a 14-7 lead at the end of the first quarter. Hyman had 101 receiving yards on the day, his first game reaching at least 100 yards receiving in his career. Richmond started off the scoring in the second quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from Green paired with a successful two-point conversion that lifted the Spiders to a 15-14 lead with 9:12 remaining in the first half. On the conversion, JMU entered a bit of a rut. JMU redshirt junior linebacker Justin Wellons was charged with a late hit on Lauletta, resulting in a 15-yard penalty on the ensuing kickoff. Richmond attempted and recovered an onside kick on the kickoff. Three plays later, the Dukes were charged with a pair of penalties, including another late hit, that advanced Richmond to JMU’s 11-yard line. However, the Dukes’ defense held firm and only relinquished a field goal. On just the third play of the Spiders’ next drive, redshirt sophomore quarterback Kyle Lauletta found junior wide receiver Brian Brown deep down the middle in one-on-one coverage for a 79-yard touchdown pass to give Richmond a 25-14 lead with 3:39 left in half. Brown also had a standout performance with 207 receiving yards and a touchdown. Lauletta completed 19 of 31 passes and finished with 415 passing yards and two touchdowns. In the remaining time in the first half, JMU proceeded to generate 14 unanswered points on the board to earn a 28-25 lead with just 22 seconds on the clock in the first half. However, as result of a 41-yard completion from Lauletta to freshman wide receiver Tyler Wilkins and a pass interference call on the Dukes, Richmond was able to knock in a 25-yard field goal to tie the game at 28 as time expired in the half. Penalties hindered the Dukes, primarily in the first half. Of JMU’s nine penalties for 95 yards against, eight were committed in the first two quarters. Richmond went on to outscore the Dukes 14-7 in the third and entered the fourth quarter with a 42-35 lead. On the first play of the quarter, Lauletta found senior wide receiver Reggie Diggs for a 40-yard completion. The very next play, Lauletta connected with redshirt sophomore tight end Garrett Hudson from three yards out to give the Spiders a 49-35 lead with 14:32 to play, Hudson’s first career touchdown. In other injury news from the game, Withers thinks freshman cornerback Charles Tutt will be out for a number of weeks with a broken bone in his leg. Sophomore wide receiver John Miller was also being tested at the University Virginia Health Center after the game for an injury he was carted of for that he suffered on a kickoff. Next Saturday, JMU travels to play the College of William & Mary (5-2, 3-1 CAA).
