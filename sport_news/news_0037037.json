One notable one was Sarkisian’s upset of USC in 2010, which was the last time Washington knocked off a ranked opponent on the road. \nUntil Thursday night, that is. \nSenior receiver Marvin Hall threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joshua Perkins on a trick play double pass to give the Huskies the lead in the third quarter, and UW held on for a stunning 17-12 upset of No. 17 USC and its former coach at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before a national television audience. \nThis must have felt familiar to Chris Petersen, too. \nIn eight years at Boise State, Petersen made a name for himself by taking the underdog Broncos on a big stage and knocking off a bigger opponent from a better conference. Thursday night, in his second season as Sarkisian’s successor at UW, Petersen got his first UW victory over a ranked opponent. \nIt was a signature moment for him and for UW’s young, rebuilding team. \nThe victory was UW’s first over a ranked opponent on the road since Sarkisian led the Huskies to that upset of No. 18 USC in 2010. \nFor Sarkisian, and for USC, it was another head-scratching defeat. Husky fans might recall that he had a few of those at UW, too. \nThe Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12) came into the season as the favorites in the Pac-12 and came into the game Thursday as a 17-point favorite over UW. \nWashington’s defense, a pleasant surprise early in the season as statistically the No. 1-ranked unit in the Pac-12, was dominant against a USC offense ranked as the conference’s best. Through three quarters, UW limited the Trojans to 245 yards on 52 plays and just 1 for 11 on third downs. \nThe Huskies intercepted USC’s Cody Kessler twice in the first half and set up the UW offense in USC territory on three occasions in the first half. \nThose three possession netted one missed field goal, an interception and one made field goal for UW. \nA mere three points. \nGiven another chance in USC territory in the second half, the Huskies didn’t waste the opportunity. On the first play after UW’s Sidney Jones forced a fumble that was recovered by Taniela Tupou, freshman quarterback Jake Browning started the double pass to Hall, who hit a wide-open Perkins in stride for UW’s first touchdown. It gave the Huskies a 10-6 lead with 11:24 left in the third quarter. \nAs UW’s defense continued to shine, the offense added another touchdown on a 1-yard run from freshman running back Myles Gaskin to extended the lead to 17-6 early in the fourth quarter. \nUSC answered with its first touchdown—a 1-yard run by Ronald Jones—to close to 17-12 after a missed two-point conversion. That drive was aided by a personal-foul targeting penalty on UW sophomore linebacker Azeem Victor, who was flagged for hitting Kessler in the head. Victor, playing perhaps the best game of his career, was ejected. By rule, he also will have to sit out the first half of UW’s game against Oregon next week. \nLater in the fourth, Travis Feeney and Elijah Qualls combined on a third-down sack of Kessler, forcing USC to attempt a 46-yard field goal. Alex Wood, the USC kicker from Mercer Island, left the kick short, hitting the cross bar. \nThat gave UW the ball back with 3:44 left. Browning completed a third-and-5 pass to Los Angeles native Jaydon Mickens for a first down and UW was able to get in victory formation after that, taking a knee three times and then celebrating a stunning victory.
