Just look at what happened to Buffalo Gap, Robert E. Lee and Stuarts Draft in this week's tabulations. \nThe Bison and the Leemen posted big wins Friday, but fell one spot in the ratings to second and seventh, respectively, in 2A East. Stuarts Draft also won big, but fell from 10th to 12th, while Wilson Memorial fell from 14th to 15th after losing to Riverheads. \nThere were no changes for the Gladiators and Waynesboro in their respective regions. The Red Pride remain atop 1A East, while the Little Giants remained at No. 10 in 3A West in the wake of their shutout win over Broadway. \nThe ratings, which determine the teams in each region that will advanced to postseason play, are an average of points from a formula that includes opponentsâ€™ classification, in-district or out-of-district status, and wins and losses by teams already beaten or defeated. \nThe top 16 teams in 2A East and 3A West go to the postseason, while the top 12 in 1A East make the postseason, with the top four teams receiving first-round byes. \nThe Bison, who last week were tied with Clarke County for the top spot in 2A East, improved to 7-1 Friday with a 42-6 thrashing of Stonewall Jackson. Clarke County, of the Bull Run District, also won, beating winless Riverside 72-6. \nThe result? Clarke County took sole possession of the top spot a 23.00 rating, while Gap fell to second at 22.75. \nIn the case of the Leemen, who were sixth in 2A East last week, they moved to 5-3 Friday with an impressive 55-21 win over Spotswood. It was third straight win for Lee, which was 12th in the first 2A East ratings. \nHowever, the Leemen fell one spot in the ratings to seventh, while being leapfrogged by Washington & Lee (No. 5) and King William (No. 6) Washington & Lee beat Rappahannock 24-10, while King William crushed 1A team Middlesex 50-20. \nStuarts Draft which was tied for 10th last week with Strasburg, rebounded from a tough loss to Wilson with a 57-14 pummeling of Page County on Friday. But the Cougars fell two spots, while Strasburg, an 8-7 winner over Madison County on Friday, fell to 11th, and Greensville, which knocked off 1A East power Franklin on Friday, moved from 12th to eighth. \nWilson remains in good shape for a 2A East playoff spot, despite its 42-7 loss to Riverheads. The Green Hornets are in the 15th spot with a 16.25 rating, 1.25 points better than No. 16 Arcadia (15.00). \nThe top five teams in 2A East this week are Clarke County, Buffalo Gap, Goochland, Amelia County and Washington & Lee. \nThe Gladiators continued their run atop 1A East, earning a rating of 26.25. Essex, William Campbell and Franklin are the next three, while Rappahannock and Sussex Central are tied for fifth. \nIn 3A West, Waynesboro maintained its 10th-place standing with a 21.11 rating, remaining ahead of No. 11 Blacksburg (20.5) and behind No. 9 Rustburg (22.25). The Little Giants play their final regular season game Friday against Fort Defiance and have a week off before the playoffs start. \nWeekly Rankings as of Oct. 26 \nGroup 2A East \n1.
