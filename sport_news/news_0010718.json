But that appeals process could take weeks or months.\nDeChambeau last summer joined Jack Nicklaus, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Ryan Moore as the only players to win the U.S. Amateur and NCAA individual titles in the same year.\nThe U.S. Amateur title made the 22-year-old golfer exempt to get into the first three majors of 2016, the Masters, the U.S. Open and the British Open.\nLate in the summer, DeChambeau had talked about his plans to stay in school to finish his physics degree and play his final season with the Mustangs.\nAccording to Golf Channel, DeChambeau plans to play the Argentina Open and Australian Open in November, and is expected to turn pro after the Masters.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
