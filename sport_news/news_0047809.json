Volatile. Scary. Call it what you want, but the U.S. stock market took a big dive in the third-quarter, causing an acute level of financial pain not felt since way back in 2011.\nMost of the world's stock markets came unglued in the three-month period from July through September. Investors from Asia to Europe to the United States dumped stocks en masse as the outlook for stocks worsened amid fears of a slowdown in China, uncertainty over the timing of interest rates from the Federal Reserve and a general bout of queasiness and pessimism not seen in years.\nUSA TODAY\nTech's biggest disasters sting investors\nHere's five \"horrendous\" market statistics that put the market's worst quarter in four years in perspective:\nThe benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which hit a record close of 2130.82 on May 21, had gone 1,326 calendar days without suffering an official correction, or drop of 10% from a high. But that correction-less streak ended on Aug. 24, when the large-company stock index finally cratered under the weight of a massive selloff that day, which included a nearly 1,100 point intraday plunge for the Dow Jones industrial average.\nUSA TODAY\nWhat sell-off? 7 stocks miraculously gain\nWhile the biggest downdraft for the S&P 500 was 12.4% from its peak on Aug. 25 -- far below the 20% bear market threshold -- the pain inside the index of 500 stocks was far greater at the individual stock level. At Monday's close, the most recent low point for the broad market gauge, 253 stocks, or more than half of the companies in S&P 500, were down more than 20% from their highs, according to S&P Capital IQ. That means that half of the index components are already in bear-market territory.\nUSA TODAY\nLoss size says no, but some stock gurus say bear market has arrived\nBlame it on overvaluation. Or blame it on a decision of a drug company to jack up the price of apill from $13.50 to $750 overnight. Or blame it on Democratic presidential hopeful HillaryClinton to take to Twitter and calling the \"price gouging\" as \"outrageous.\" But the bust in biotech was gargantuan. The Nasdaq Biotech index, prior to Wednesday's nearly 4% rebound, suffered eight straight days of losses -- its longest streak since the financial crisis in October 2008. In those eight days, the index fell 20.1%, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The takeaway: the biotech sector suffered a bear market in the span of just eight days.\nUSA TODAY\nHillary Clinton's 21 words clobber biotechs\nThe Dow Jones industrial average, which peaked on May 19 at 18,312.39 has fallen off a cliff. At 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, 90 minutes from the end of the quarter, the Dow as down to 16,226.11, or a slide of 1,393 points.\nBig losses were across the board and across the pond,too. For example, Germany's main stock index, the DAX, crumbled 11.7% in the third quarter, hurt by the slowdown in China, where it sells a lot of cars and other things. Similarly, shares in mainland China's Shanghai composite index, which was Ground Zero for the global market selloff, plunged 29% in the third quarter.\nUSA TODAY\nWall Street enters 4Q wondering if worst is over", "external_links": ["http://imgur.com/Q9Ujwgc.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f55cf756624b3a8cc6e1b2af599a6d0acfb7b137/c=0-52-1024-631&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635784352207402329-489127872-76037426.JPG", "http://imgur.com/LgSknUg.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/09/30/stocks-thrive-3q-market-selloff/73091772/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/09/30/wall-street-enters-4q-wondering-if-worst-over/73104030/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04b8bec6b09be4c8ec13e127598f748ba87fa9e0/c=170-0-853-683/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792193313897377-GTY-485180840-75365499.JPG", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/09/28/stock-decline-adds-up-to-bear-market-some-gurus-say/72982012/", "http://imgur.com/gzi0exS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6a82b0b3ae387ba5376195b38a883baa6cd9aa8c/c=0-213-1573-1786/local/-/media/2015/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635790469785183687-BEAR-4.23.03.JPG", "http://imgur.com/pyuR97T.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e47265371f176e1ca60045acf5227a963f0f1c0e/c=500-0-2500-2000/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792246423658763-WALL-STREET.9.28.15.4Q.OUTLOOK.JPG", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/09/30/tech-stocks-biggest-disasters/73100110/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/667e32771deb630317b2995798338964ccb7eb4f/c=168-0-856-688/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792219208641857-GTY-148470916-70373154.JPG", "http://imgur.com/zctXzgu.jpg", "http://imgur.com/K8qxHGC.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/09/21/hillary-clinton-tweet-biotech/72563788/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:35:21.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
