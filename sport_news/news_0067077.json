Falcons coach LaVale Woods minced no words with Millennium at halftime. “At halftime threats were made,” Woods said. “I told them they didn’t need to come out for the second half and you saw the difference in the third and fourth quarters.” Leading 7-0 entering the fourth quarter, the Falcons (4-4 overall, 3-1 Central California Athletic Alliance) rediscovered their frustrating ways by fumbling away their first possession of the period. But that frustration lasted for just one play as Hernandez intercepted a pass on the next play and returned it 33 yards to the Eagles 6-yard line. Two plays later Angel Deleon (eight carries, 58 yards) ran it in from the 3 for a 14-0 lead. Following an interception by Solomon Daniel, Hernandez pulled in a 50-yard pass from Jordan Johnson to get down to the Eagles 8. Jenoah Gandall (10 carries, 66 yards) took care of the final eight yards with a 6-yard gain followed by a 2-yard scoring plunge for a 20-0 lead. “The second half went a lot better than the first half,” Hernandez said. “We all worked harder in the second half. It seems like we had to wake up a little bit.” Beset by injuries most of the year, this was Millennium running back Aaron Cook’s first complete game this season and he did not disappoint. The junior racked up 134 yards on 21 carries. Cook got the first score for the Falcons. Their initial scoring drive was 76 yards on just five plays with the final 62 yards coming on a scamper by Cook with 4:44 left in the third quarter. “I wasn’t thinking about scoring on that long run,” Cook said. “I was just thinking about how I was supposed to hit the hole and run. “It feels good to be back out there and I have the confidence back. I just want to win and stay healthy throughout the rest of the year. I have to take my rehab seriously.” The Falcons found a way to hurt themselves on every one of their first-half drives. Penalties killed the first two drives, a muffed snap on a punt ended the third, a broken play on fourth and one killed the next drive and penalties killed their last drive of the first half. A penalty stalled Millennium’s first drive of the second half and the ensuing punt went just 9 yards to give Turlock Christian (1-7, 0-4) the ball at the Falcons 46, but the Eagles could not capitalize and turned it over on downs at the 25. “Ten penalties in the first half is not winning football,” Woods said. “My No. 1 goal is to develop young men. If I have a young man on the field, he is going to do everything he can to win — it’s that simple. “We didn’t play like men in the first half. We had too many mistakes and were selfish and we had guys this week who were not at practice and were just doing their own thing.” Isaiah Adams had eight tackles for the Falcons defense that did not give up a score until the game’s final minute. Dorian Wright added seven and Nate Cabral five. All of Cabral’s tackles were for a loss and Deleon had a fumble recovery. “I think we owe it to our coach and the rest of our team not to be heroes,” Cabral said. “We are doing our jobs and trying to be men out her, getting to our spots when we need to instead of trying to make the tackles by ourselves. “If I can get to the ball carrier I will, and if I can’t I will make sure someone else does.” By Dave Campbell", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:18:42.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
