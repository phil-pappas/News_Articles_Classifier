The other members of the line remained the same: left tackle Rod Johnson, center Ryan Hoefeld, right guard Wilson Bell and right tackle Derrick Kelly. \n•Freshman quarterback Deondre Francois was utilized on the scout team to replicate mobile Louisville freshman quarterback Lamar Jackson. \n“You got to tackle. You got to keep edges. It’s every play. You got to know if he’s got the ball or not, and he takes you off the guys who do have ball. He’s a heck of a player.” \n•Fisher said the Seminoles have had their best week of practice so far this season. \n“Practice has been good. Hopefully, knock on wood, we can take it to the field because we’ve practiced very well. Not perfect, but a lot better and a lot more mental toughness, a lot more execution and the things we’re doing.” \nThe Seminoles (5-0, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) and Cardinals (2-3, 1-1) will kickoff at noon, and the game will be televised on ESPN.
