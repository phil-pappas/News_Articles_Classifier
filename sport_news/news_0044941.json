It is the eighth straight year the squad has sat atop the league standings. \n“It’s tough every year,” Glenbard West coach Chad Hetlet said. “This year we had the bang, bang, bang with the three undefeated teams. We had to keep our composure. Our team is coming together and [against OPRF] we saw what we look like as a complete team.” \nGlenbard West was playing just six days after defeating Hinsdale Central 35-24 in another WSS showdown. Senior running back Isaiah Skinner credited the coaching staff for its role in guarding against a letdown. \n“Coach Hetlet and all of the other coaches, they prepare us every day,” he said. “They tell us to never let up and to never get too high. That really helps us out.” \nSkinner and fellow senior Sam Brodner continued to be unstoppable out of the backfield against the Huskies. \nSkinner led the way with 103 rushing yards on 18 carries while providing the big play with a 68-yard touchdown on a screen pass in the third quarter that extended the visitors’ advantage to 21-7. Brodner added three touchdowns and 104 yards on the ground and had four catches for 33 yards. \n“Conference is kind of expected for us,” Brodner said. “We have won it however many years in a row. But this was a big test for us and we were able to play to the best of our ability.” \nQuarterback Brian Cochrane completed 13 of 17 passes for 212 yards, and Kobe Easley hauled in a 19-yard score in the fourth quarter. The defense yielded a touchdown to OPRF on the home team’s opening possession before shutting the door the rest of the way. \nThe defense held the Huskies to just seven first downs. \nWith two weeks remaining in the regular season, the next major goal is to clinch a top seed in the postseason. But true to form, Glenbard West isn’t looking that far ahead. \n“I know it sounds cliche but we just want to be 1-0 this week. That’s all we want to do,” Hetlet said. “The game [against Oak Park] was no more important than this week’s game.” \nBrodner echoed that sentiment. \n“We are taking it week by week and trying to get better in everything we do,” the running back said. \nGlenbard South junior Cooke keeps rolling at running back \nSean Cooke followed a career game against Wheaton Academy with another highlight performance. \nAfter rushing for more than 300 yards and scoring seven touchdowns in a win against Wheaton Academy, the Glenbard South junior running back followed with 252 yards and five scores in the Raiders’ 42-0 win against Aurora Central Catholic on Oct. 9. \nCooke had scoring runs of 69, 47, 42, 51, and 3 yards in the first half, and Javonis Hawkins triggered the running clock with a 29-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. \nDefensively, South (5-2 overall, 3-0 Metro Suburban West) held ACC to 59 total yards and five first downs. \nSouth gets set for a de facto MSW title game against host IC Catholic at 1 p.m. Oct. 17. Both teams are 3-0 in conference and riding extended winning streaks, South at five games and IC at six games. \nThe Raiders have scored an MSW-high 278 points this season while yielding just 93 points with two shutout wins. IC has scored 276 points and allowed 113. \n– \nWho: Proviso West at Glenbard West \nWhen: 1:30 p.m. Oct. 17 \nWhere: 670 Crescent Blvd., Glen Ellyn \nOutlook: A victory in this game would give Glenbard West its seventh outright West Suburban Silver title in the past eight years [the Hilltoppers tied for first place with Lyons Township in 2010]. Proviso West is in the midst of a down season, having scored 10 or few points in five of their games. The Panthers’ lone win came against Proviso East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:10:41.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
