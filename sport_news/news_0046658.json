The trio of East Boston, BC High and Walpole all lost by double-digits, proving how badly we underestimated the winners (Madison Park, Andover and Milton, respectively).\n In the possibility of another rough week in Pickorama, we're heading to the excuse board. Any game lost this weekend will be attributed to Hurricane Joaquin.\n TEWKSBURY over Andover: Should be a crazy night with the portable lights in Tewksbury.\n BC HIGH over Brockton: Basing this pick on the real possibility that Kerry Raymond doesn't play\n Foxboro over CANTON: Feel good about the Warriors unless it goes to overtime, where the Bulldogs have been lethal.\n Holliston over WESTWOOD: Going against the advice of a certain parent â€“ even if he is from Wolverine Country.\n Marshfield over BRIDGEWATER-RAYNHAM: Could be one of the better contests this weekend.\n MELROSE over Watertown: Red Raiders prevail in this battle of unbeatens.\n Lawrence Academy over GOVERNOR'S ACADEMY: Hope this isn't my annual get burned for picking against Governor's game.\n ABINGTON over East Bridgewater: Just have a sense this is the game Vikings are really going to miss injured quarterback Ryan Graham.\n Central Catholic over EVERETT: Raiders have a history of excellence at Everett Memorial, even if it just a one-game history.\n ST. JOHN'S PREP over Malden Catholic: Eagles have too much arsenal for the upstart Lancers.\nHOME TEAM IN CAPS\nLAST WEEK: 7-3 (.700)\nSEASON TO DATE: 23-7 (.767)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:17:12.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
