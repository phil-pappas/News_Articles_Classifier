He gained 135 of his 163 yards after intermission and scored on runs of 54 and 14 yards to spark the 11th-ranked Seminoles to a 41-21 victory. \nFSU (6-0, 4-0) won its 28th ACC game in a row and will attempt to tie the program record of 29 in succession set under Bobby Bowden from 1992-1995 when they travel to Georgia Tech next week. \n“He [Cook] just makes play after play in the moment, chasing the ball,” Seminoles coach Jimbo Fisher said. \nSenior quarterback Everett Golson, despite being harassed all day by the Cardinals pass rush, completed 26-of-38 passes for a season-high 372 yards and three touchdowns. He found Kermit Whitfield nine times for 172 yards, the second week in a row that Whitfield has caught nine passes. His yardage is a career-high. \n“Coach Fisher gets us prepared very well,” said Cook, who is 45 yards shy of his second 1,000-yard season and has 10 touchdowns. “He’s hard on us in practice and puts us in a lot of different situations to get us ready.” \nSeminoles Notebook: DB Trey Marshall suffers arm injury \nWith nickel back Trey Marshall leaving the game with an arm injury in the first quarter, thinning an already depleted secondary, the FSU defensive line took the initiative. Tackle Nile Lawrence-Stample had four solo tackles, a sack and batted down a pass, and end Demarcus Walker of Jacksonville added a sack and a swatted pass. \nJacob Pugh, who plays FSU’s hybrid linebacker-end position, had two sacks. \n“We stuck to the game plan,” Walker said of the scheme to contain Jackson’s running first. “We have fun, do our job and try to get back there.” \nFSU stumbled through an awful first half on offense, managing only two Roberto Aguayo field goals. The Cardinals (2-4, 1-2) scored on an 18-yard touchdown pass from freshman quarterback Lamar Jackson to the aptly-named wide receiver James Quick and held on for a 7-6 halftime lead -- the first time in 16 games that the Seminoles had not scored a touchdown in the first half. \nLouisville’s pass rush produced two sacks and Golson lost 10 yards after a fumbled shotgun snap, leaving FSU with zero net rushing yards through two quarters. Cook, who has been playing with a hamstring injury, gained only 28 yards. \n“I felt good at halftime,” said Louisville coach Bobby Petrino. \nThat changed in a hurry. \nOn FSU’s opening drive of the third quarter, Cook took off around right end, eluding Louisville linebacker Devonte’ Fields. He got a key block from Jesus Wilson, shed a tackle attempt by safety Josh Harvey-Clemons and made a move that ended with UL cornerback Trumaine Washington and safety Chucky Williams running into each other. \nWith Whitfield shielding the only UL player who could have caught Cook, he went into the end zone standing up for a 13-7 lead. \nThe Cardinals responded with a 19-yard TD pass from Jackson (20-of-35, 307 yards) to Quick (five receptions for 130 yards) to regain the lead at 14-13. It was their last gasp. \nOn the next possession, Golson scrambled to buy time and hit Whitfield at the FSU 45, who went the remaining distance for a 70-yard TD play. \nThe FSU defense then recorded its biggest play of the game, courtesy of two true freshmen. Strong safety Derwin James sacked Jackson on a blitz off the edge, forcing a fumble that end Josh Sweat recovered at the Louisville 36. After a targeting penalty on linebacker Keith Brown resulted in 15 yards and his ejection, Cook went around the left side untouched for a 14-yard TD and a 27-14 Seminoles lead. \nLouisville turned the ball over again on its next possession as former walk-on safety Javien Elliott intercepted a deep pass by Jackson. Golson engineered a 13-play, 83-yard drive that ate up almost six minutes of the clock and ended when he threw a 13-yard TD pass to Travis Rudolph. \nJackson found Quick for one more touchdown, from 39 yards out to cut the lead to 34-21 but Golson took the ‘Noles on another time-consuming stroll down the field, an 11-play, 75-yard trek that chewed up 6:45 and ended in a 2-yard TD pass to tight end Ryan Izzo. \nWith only 4:12 remaining, Louisville was done. \n“[Golson] wasn’t perfect,” Fisher said. “He left some things out there. But those drives, with poise, eating the clock... extremly proud.” \nGolson, who as usual wasn’t made available to the media, is still without a turnover this season. \n“We kept playing our game and kept elevating and evolving,” Whitfield said. “We didn’t play our best ball in the first half. In the second half, we came out and started playing FSU football.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:14:45.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
