The Railroaders had ample reasons to do so.\nFor the second straight year, Whitehall proved to be the best Section II Class D football team during the regular season. Each time, it came with a win against Cambridge.\nThe Railroaders raced out to a two-touchdown lead led by stars Daryl Hillman and Jake Gregory , then made that advantage hold up with some stingy defense in the second half as Whitehall secured a 29-14 victory against the Indians.\n\"There were a lot of emotions during this game. We had a lot to prove,\" Gregory said. \"We had a lot to prove to our fans and our family, which is our team.\"\nWhitehall (7-0 overall, 5-0 Class D) proved plenty in locking up the No. 1 seed for the four-team playoffs beginning Oct. 31 at Schuylerville. The Railroaders proceeded to chug right down the field on their opening drive, largely behind their tiny (5-foot-10, 155 pounds), yet powerful, locomotive named Hillman. The junior back capped that series with a five-yard touchdown run.\nSeconds later, Cambridge quarterback Brendan Holcomb couldn't grasp a bad center snap and Gregory pounced, scooping it up and dashing 44 yards to help provide Whitehall a 15-0 cushion with 6:15 left in the first quarter.\n\"Just a huge momentum swing,\" is how Whitehall first-year coach Rich Gould described Gregory's touchdown.\nHillman and Gregory were not done.\nAfter Cambridge senior running back Andy Romack scored on a 17-yard touchdown run with 9:25 left before halftime, Hillman responded by returning the ensuing kickoff 75 yards for a touchdown.\n\"He is not just a big factor on the field, he is a big factor off the field. He helps other kids when they are down,\" Gregory said of Hillman. \"He is a great kid and a great kid to be around.\"\nHillman led the offense with 166 tough yards on 34 carries. Gregory spurred the defense. Cambridge (6-1, 4-1) finished with 14 plays that lost yardage and Gregory made tackles on nine of those plays.\n\"Jake does that all the time. You can't replace Jake Gregory,\" Gould said. \"He is so fast off the ball. In practice, we put two or three guys over him. Otherwise, it just isn't fair.\"\n\"Everything they did, they did well today. They controlled us,\" Cambridge coach Doug Luke said of the Railroaders. \"Hillman ran hard. He's a tough little kid.\"\nLuke added, \"we're not an athletic team. We have to fight hard to get what we get.\"\nRomack scored on a 15-yard TD run in the third quarter, but Whitehall's defense later stopped Cambridge three times on downs in the second half.\n\"I thought we were going to be mediocre this year,\" Gregory said. \"I didn't think we'd be this good. I thought we'd be all right and make the playoffs.\"\njallen@timesunion.com • 518-454-5062 • @TUSidelines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:30:26.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
