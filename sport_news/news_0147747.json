Howard faced 33 shots in what he described as one of Detroit's toughest preseason games this year. \n\"I think this time of year, you want to see shots,\" Howard said. \"You definitely don't want to be standing up, twiddling your thumbs. You want to see action. You want guys in your face.\" \nHoward improves to 3-0-0 and has a .937 save percentage through four exhibition appearances. \nBABCOCK'S RETURN \nFormer Red Wings coach Mike Babcock returned to Joe Louis Arena for the first time since being named head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. \nWings defenseman Niklas Kronwall was asked how weird it was to look at the visitor's bench during a first intermission interview with FOX Sports Detroit: \"You know what, I think it's time we stop talking about that. Right now we need to focus on our own game, set that aside.\" \nDYNAMIC DUO \nDylan Larkin , the Red Wings' first-round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, played against former Michigan teammate Zach Hyman . Larkin said the two exchanged a few laughs during warmups and would catch up after the game. The pair formed a dynamic duo during Larkin's first and only season with the Wolverines. \nINJURY REPORT \nWings defenseman Mike Green returned to the lineup Friday after missing the last four exhibition games due to a groin injury. \nDanny DeKeyser will miss 3-4 weeks with a strained ligament in his left foot, general manager Ken Holland announced Friday. \nNEXT UP \nThe Red Wings will travel to Toronto for their final exhibition game on Saturday, Oct. 3 at 7 p.m. \nDetroit will host the Maple Leafs next Friday, Oct. 9 at 7:30 p.m. to open the regular season. A special one-hour pregame show will air on FOX Sports Detroit prior to the game. \nSCORING SUMMARY \nRed Wings Goals: Justin Abdelkader (2:31, first period), Drew Miller (5:21, first period), Henrik Zetterberg (3:57, third period), Brad Richards (3:57, third period) \nMaple Leafs Goals: James van Riemsdyk (1:09, first period), Mark Arcobello (19:28, second period)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:57:31.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
