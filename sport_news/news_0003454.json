Game plan implications? by JJ 10/16/2015 4:42:34 PM That's it! need to throw paint balloons at Zingermans! by Homer Noodleman 10/16/2015 4:42:20 PM I'm going on the assumption the MSU OL will be the one I just mentioned, and the assumption it will be better and help MSU score some points. My pick is based more on the Michigan O vs. the MSU D. But we also don't know a big question there? Can Darian Hicks play. Pretty big key. by Joe Rexrode 10/16/2015 4:42:18 PM Joe, I rely on your objective commentary because I think it is well thought out and corroborated by careful study of on the field performance. What makes the call of this game so difficult is the lack of complete understanding of the Spartan's injury status. Q: If the offensive line is healthier than we are thought to believe, would this change your assessment of the outcome? by dwisk 10/16/2015 4:41:27 PM If MSU stops the run, then Rudock has more on his shoulders and more MSU rushers in his face. If. by Joe Rexrode 10/16/2015 4:41:21 PM Joe, just remember we don't live in a universe where Jake Rudock can beat Connor Cook in anything. Horshoes, bowling, and especially not a football game. I like our D Lines chances of forcing him into a mistake or two. Unleash FREY by Matt 10/16/2015 4:41:04 PM Hmm, is that what I said? Maybe a bit of embellishing there. But I do think Rudock can make plays on the MSU D. This ain't the 2013 MSU D that shut him down at Iowa City. by Joe Rexrode 10/16/2015 4:40:57 PM Joe says that U-M's Rudock is going to carve up MSU's secondary... and the MSU defensive line and linebackers aren't going to get to him because the U-M O-Line are so awesome... what's wrong with that picture? by MSU '81 10/16/2015 4:40:23 PM Yes, I do. by Joe Rexrode 10/16/2015 4:40:18 PM Do you ever feel bad for the U of M beat writers with some of those Harbaugh interviews? I'm not trying to make a joke, as a journalist it must be tough with how little he gives. by ChickenTenders 10/16/2015 4:40:14 PM MSU is studying Stanford film this week. So I'm sure that will help some. The question remains, can THIS MSU defense stop that style. Previous ones would relish this matchup. by Joe Rexrode 10/16/2015 4:40:11 PM Any advantage to Spartan prep by having played Stanford in Rose Bowl? Any carryover in O or D philosophy/scheme from Harbaugh to Shaw? And now to UM? by ChiTownSparty 10/16/2015 4:39:41 PM 55-3 MSU wins. Harbaugh signs with the Colts for $12M per year, dreams die in AA. by tsWill.com 10/16/2015 4:39:38 PM Blue Tractor BBQ. Good stuff. by Chron 10/16/2015 4:39:33 PM All time? MSU doesn't really have a Larry Foote, a guy who just goes off about it. I would put a Max Bullough up there. I'd put a Kirk Cousins up there. Jerel Worthy. I'm probably forgetting some big ones. Drew Stanton. by Joe Rexrode 10/16/2015 4:39:32 PM After all your chats with players, which State player has the most hatred or appreciation for the rivalry? by Denver Sparty 10/16/2015 4:38:46 PM Rim shot. by Joe Rexrode 10/16/2015 4:38:42 PM You can pick first, then you would be pre-Madonna. by Spartisimo 10/16/2015 4:38:32 PM Conklin LT, McGowan LG, Brian Allen C, Donavon Clark RG, Kieler RT. That's a line with a chance to do some things, assuming Kieler has healed more this week and Conklin can be Conklin. by Joe Rexrode 10/16/2015 4:38:29 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:44:33.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
