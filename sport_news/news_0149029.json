I would imagine that the next time they are due for an international game, that should not be given to them.\" \n\"Maybe it will be another two years before Cuttack gets a game, but that game should not be given to them and it should be announced that it has not been given to them because of crowd behaviour.\" \nUpset with India's dismal batting display against Proteas, fans in the stadium hurled plastic bottles onto the ground on Monday night. \n2nd T20I: Angry Indian fans throw bottles onto the ground in Cuttack \nAfter being sent to bat by South African captain Faf du Plessis, Indian batsmen struggled as they were bowled out for 92 runs in 17.2 overs. This was a must-win game for the hosts in the 3-match series after losing the opener by 7 wickets in Dharamsala. \nGavaskar on commentary, said, \"This is so so sad. (This has) spoilt the name of Indian cricket.\" \nIt was a full house (attendance - 44,790) at the Barabati Stadium, hosting its first ever T20I and some fans in one of the stands were agitated with the Indian team and started hurling plastic bottles onto the ground. \nWith the boundary ropes brought in, most of the bottles landed outside the playing area. There were nets at the ground but the bottles came from the higher stands. \nTo pacify the spectators, announcements were made by Odisha Cricket Association (OCA) and it was only after 10 minutes of drama that it was brought under control by the local police. But it was not the end. \nThis was after India were bowled out. \nAgain water bottles were thrown with South Africa needing 29 more runs to win, at the end of the 11th over (South Africa 64/3). \nPlay was stopped due to this crowd trouble. It resumed after about 25-minute stoppage. \nThe match restarted and South Africa won by 6 wickets with that the series 2-0. But the match will be remembered for crowd's disgraceful behaviour. \nOneIndia News Read more about: Other articles published on Oct 6, 2015 Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:59:55.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
