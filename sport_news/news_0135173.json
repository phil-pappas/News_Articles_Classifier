(Photo: Provided/NFL Now) \nThe Cincinnati Bengals are awash in waves of popularity, with the players and coaches in demand for their time and likeness. Such are the spoils of victory. \nBut sometimes, a question long unanswered needed to be asked – whether the team was undefeated, or winless. \nAnd the Sklar Brothers , Randy and Jason, were the ones to ask it. \n“Where are the Ben-Guys?” Randy asked last Sunday as they waited to run out onto the Paul Brown Stadium turf. \nFollowing their show at the Taft Theatre on Saturday, the comedy duo rolled over to PBS to hang out with the Ben-Gals, and see if they had what it took to be Ben-Guys. The Enquirer caught up with the pair during a break in filming, as they recorded the experience for the NFL Network’s “Trend Zone.” \n“You think about collegiate cheerleading – and we’re college football fans – there are tons of guys,” Randy said, an extra small Ben-Gals jacket fitting snugly over his clothes. “Where do they go?” \n“They have settle and move on in life and become presidents of the United States like George Bush,” Jason interjected. “They don’t get the glory.” \nThey noted that the Baltimore Ravens have male cheerleaders, but that’s it. \nThe Bengals' cheerleaders welcomed the Sklar brothers onto their team prior to the Seattle game on Oct. 11.
