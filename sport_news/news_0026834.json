SOCCER \nMadison Southern’s Ally Bowling is mobbed by teammates after scoring the game-winning goal Tuesday against Model. Posted: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 12:36 am \nBEREA — For the fifth-straight year, Madison Central and Madison Southern will face each other in the district championship game. \nBut, it certainly wasn’t easy for the Lady Eagles to get back to the finals. \nMadison Southern (9-6-1) got two goals from Ally Bowling, including the game-winner in overtime, and picked up a thrilling 2-1 win over Model Laboratory Tuesday in the semifinals of the 44th District Tournament. \nThe Lady Patriots (11-5-2) tied the game on a goal by Mallory Smith with just 6:29 left in regulation. \nBowling’s goal came with just 1:09 left in overtime. \n“They had the momentum (late). This game was back-and-forth all night,” Southern coach Katy Cress said. “Model has improved so much, but I’m just so proud of my girls for not giving up. I had a lot of young girls who were in there tonight who stepped up big. It was a huge team effort.” \nSouthern and Central will meet in the district final on Thursday. The game is set for 6 p.m. at Madison Southern. \nBowling gave the Lady Eagles the lead in the 23rd minute and that lead held up until late in the second half. \nJust 10 minutes after halftime, Smith had a chance to tie the game, but her penalty kick went wide left. \nThe junior midfielder was able to get her head on a corner kick to pull the Lady Patriots even late and junior keeper Linda Yoder made some good saves to send the game into extra time. \nAt the start of the second overtime, Model coach Michael Bailey made a goaltending switch and put Sophie Austin in net. The sophomore was tested right away and made a sprawling save on Chesney Sipple as Southern started to get some sustained pressure. \n“The reason we lost that game is all on me and the decisions I made,” Bailey said. “Those girls have done everything I’ve asked them for three years and the only one who cost them tonight was me. That’s just the bottom line. They didn’t deserve an ending like that.” \nBowling’s game-winner came on a long, looping kick from the left side beyond the edge of the box. The ball floated into the far corner of the net, just past Austin. \n“That’s what I had been saying all night — cut middle and take that outside shot,” Cress said. “Finally, they did it and it went right in.” \nThe Lady Eagles have been in the district final in each of the past six seasons, but they haven’t won a title since 2011. \nCentral has beaten Southern in the championship game each of the past three years, all by scores of 1-0.
