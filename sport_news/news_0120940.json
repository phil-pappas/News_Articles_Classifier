Western Big 6 In 2014 an overtime loss at home to Alleman was all that kept Galesburg from going unbeaten in conference play. This week the Streaks hit the road to take on the Pioneers to try and redeem the lone WB6 loss. Galesburg sits in the conference driver’s seat at the moment but with three more weeks left in WB6 play anything could happen. Quincy got back on track last week while Moline pulled out a big rivalry win over Rock Island. On the surface Galesburg’s road trip to Quincy in Week 8 should be for the championship but don’t overlook the capabilities of the other 1-1 squads. West Central Macomb got an absolutely huge win against Illini West to get to 2-0 in the West Central and now takes on a West Hancock team that took a big loss at the hands of Quincy Notre Dame in Week 5. QND looks to be the class of the conference but Macomb’s playoff hopes look more realistic than at any other point in the past three seasons. Monmouth-Roseville has the second most playoff points (26) among 3A schools sitting at 2-3, the problem is the Titans are sitting at 2-3. Finishing with wins in three of the last four is what it will take for M-R to get into the postseason, which makes this week’s contest with Illini West essentially must win. Prairieland Black Last week Abingdon-Avon and South Fulton played one of the best games the area will see this season and because the Rebels came out victorious it puts A-Town in the awkward spot of worrying about the playoffs. Getting into the postseason is likely going to require six wins considering the Tornadoes’ playoff point total but with a matchup against a very tough Elmwood/Brimfield team in Week 8 A-Town still has a lot of work to do to get there. If South Fulton and Rushville-Industry take care of business this week the contest between the two set for Week 7 will decide the fate of the conference title. Prairieland Blue River Valley has forfeited the rest of its games which means Elmwood/Brimfield is going to have a bye week heading into a big matchup with Farmington next week. Whether rest or rust is the primary result of the extra days off will be determined when the Trojans and Farmers face-off in Elmwood. Knoxville is coming off its own bye week (the Blue Bullets were slated to play River Valley until a mid-week forfeiture) and will play Havana on Friday with an eye on getting back to .500 for the season. Bushnell/West Prairie’s playoff hopes hinge on pulling some upsets in their final four games which begin with a home date against Farmington this week. Page 2 of 2 - Three Rivers Mississippi The headliner this week is the clash of unbeatens featuring state power Sterling Newman Catholic and the unexpectedly 5-0 Princeton Tigers. Newman should come out on top but Princeton has already pulled off some surprises this season and could very well get another this week. Hall still plays Erie/Prophetstown and Newman which means a backdoor conference title is possibly but the degree of difficulty will be high. Before those games the Red Devils must face a Kewanee team looking end a three-game skid. Three Rivers Rock Orion might not have the conference officially wrapped up but it is hard to think the Chargers won’t find themselves at the top of the Rock by season’s end after getting a win over Rockridge last week. A 9-0 campaign is now likely the primary goal. Even with three losses Rockridge is still a dangerous team but those three losses now mean any postseason run is going to start on the road. Still, 2A squads aren’t going to enjoy being paired with the Rockets if they start to pick up some momentum down the stretch. Lincoln Trail A running clock at a game played in Aledo isn’t unheard of, just never expected to be the result of the road team’s dominance. Stark County’s dismantling of Mercer County is the reason the Rebels are up to second place in the Class 1A AP rankings and with Annawan/Wethersfield still sitting at number seven, and Princeville listed as the first team out of the top 10, the Lincoln Trail is packing a punch in the polls. Big games litter the rest of the LTC calendar and it starts with Princeville hosting United this week. As for the playoff point watch, despite sitting at 3-2 Mid-County is squarely on the playoff bubble with 23 opponent victories. Mercer County is in better shape with 29 but the Golden Eagles are at 2-3 and have difficult games with A/W and United remaining.
