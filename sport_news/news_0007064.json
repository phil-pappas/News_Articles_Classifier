(AP) — Austin Gahafer threw for 363 yards and three touchdowns as Morehead State rallied past Butler 34-21 in Pioneer League play on Saturday. \nGahafer has accounted for 20 of 21 touchdowns this season for Morehead State (3-3, 2-1), and has thrown for at least three TDS in five straight games. He threw TDs to three different receivers — a 40-yarder to Darius Pritchett, a 13-yarder to Jake Raymond and found Tanner Napier from 44 yards. \nButler (3-2, 1-1) grabbed a 14-10 lead with back-to-back drives in the second quarter, Matt Shiltz finding Pace Temple with a 10-yard pass, and then scoring on a 41-yard run. The Bulldogs closed to 24-21 in the fourth quarter when Shiltz found Cord Collier from the 7. \nMorehead State’s Luke Keller collected nine tackles in his first game this season, returning after a staph infection serious enough that he was told it would end his playing career.
