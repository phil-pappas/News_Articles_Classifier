Fort Worth's husband and wife Brian and Alison Miller qualified at Ironman Brazil. Brian, 43, won his age group to earn his second Kona slot. Alison, 36, placed second to secure her spot at Kona after 10 tries.\nArlington's Tom Rodgers and Plano's David Jones also qualified in their respective Men's 55-59 and Men's 50-54 age groups. Click here to read about Rodgers, who is making his ninth trip to Kona and Jones, who is making his seventh trip to Kona.\nRehab led Conley into triathlon. She began swimming and cycling when she was sidelined with a running injury\n\"As soon as I could run again, triathlon was a natural step,\" said Conley, who ran cross country at Plano West.\nShe entered the 2010 Ironman 70.3 Kansas, finished and swore off endurance triathlons for a few years.\nIn 2014, she competed in two more 70.3 distance events, New Orleans and Raleigh, and qualifying for the 70.3 World Championships in Mont Tremblant.\nShe ended the year by racing her first full Ironman in Chattanooga.\n\"I went in to that day only hoping for a finish,\" she said.\nShe won her age group and qualified for Kona.\n\"I'm admittedly terrified about competing against the world's best athletes and some challenging heat and wind.\"\nThe Millers recently started their own triathlon team in Fort Worth called Relentless Racing. They've become one of Fort Worth's fittest couples. They followed different paths to triathlon, which led to their meeting, marrying and both getting to Kona.\nAlison Miller, a lifelong soccer player, needed a challenge once after she graduated and finished playing Division I soccer for the Aggies. She began running. Once she qualified for Boston, she needed a new goal, so she bought a bike and began to swim. After a few shorter triathlons, she began training for full Ironman races and finished top 20 in her age group at the Coeur D'Alene in 2008. She knew she wanted to improve her finish.\nBrian grew up swimming on YMCA teams and playing high school football. Once he entered the working world, he stopped being active and gained weight. He finally decided to resume swimming to lose weight. He met several triathletes at the pool. He did his first triathlon in 1998 and his first Ironman in 2006. He also raced the 2008 Ironman Coeur D'Alene, but he and Alison didn't know each other at that point.\nThey first met as the overall men's and women's winners at a local sprint triathlon in Cleburne in September 2008. They began dating and training more seriously.\n\"I made him run more,\" said Alison. \"He made me swim more, and we both needed more biking.\"\nThey got married and signed up for the inaugural Ironman Texas. They both placed fifth in their respective age groups. Brian earned a slot to Kona. Alison missed out. He did Ironman in 2011. Alison decided she wasn't going back until she earned her own slot.\nShe completed two full Ironman races a year for the next three years in hopes of qualifying. She along with Brian came close but missed out until the inaugural Ironman Brazil last year.\nBrian, 43, won his age group. Alison, 36, placed second and was the fourth amateur woman overall. That earned them both Kona spots.\n\"Here we are,\" Alison said. \"We don't have a coach. We come up with our training between the two of us.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @DFWRunning", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DFWRunning"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:27:17.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
