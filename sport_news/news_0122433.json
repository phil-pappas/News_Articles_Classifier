(AP) — Portland State’s Bruce Barnum, a first-time head coach whose Vikings opened the season with their first-ever victory over a Pac-12 team, has been given a five-year contract, the school announced Wednesday. \nBarnum had been the Vikings’ offensive coordinator but he was elevated last year when the Portland State dismissed Nigel Burton after five seasons. Barnum was given a one-year contract, largely seen as a try-out for the top job. \nPortland State opened the season with a 24-17 upset of Washington State on Sept. 5, a first for the Vikings. Portland State has gone on to compile a 4-1 record. \nAthletic director Mark Rountree said in announcing the contract that, “Coach Barnum has proven he can lead our team to compete at the highest levels.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:47:01.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
