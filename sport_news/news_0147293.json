(Rick Scuteri / Associated Press) Associated Press \nGLENDALE, Ariz. -- Todd Gurley rushed for all but five of 146 yards in the second half and the St. Louis Rams held on to hand the Arizona Cardinals their first loss of the season, 24-22 on Sunday. \nGurley, the Rams' first-round draft pick, saw his most extensive action as a pro and his 52-yard run set up what proved to be the winning touchdown. \nNick Foles threw for three touchdowns, two after Arizona turnovers, and St. Louis' defense held the Cardinals (3-1) to field goals on four of five trips inside the red zone. \nArizona had a third-and-2 at the Rams 43 in the final minutes, but Carson Palmer overthrew receivers on consecutive plays to turn the ball over on downs. \nThe Rams (2-2) are 2-0 against the NFC West. \nBroncos 23, Vikings 20 \nDENVER -- Brandon McManus kicked a 39-yard field goal with 1:51 left and Denver had seven sacks in the the win over Minnesota.

(Paul Sancya / Associated Press) \nVon Miller smothered the loose ball after T.J. Ward's sack-strip of Teddy Bridgewater in the closing seconds, sealing the win for the unbeaten Broncos (4-0), who got a 72-yard touchdown run from Ronnie Hillman. \nPeyton Manning has led his teams to a 4-0 start seven times, most in NFL history by a long shot. Next up at four is Fran Tarkenton. Manning also joined Brett Favre as the only QBs to win 100 home starts in the NFL. \nIt wasn't a great day for Manning, who was picked off twice by the Vikings (2-2). \nAdrian Peterson ran for a 48-yard touchdown to pull Minnesota to 20-17 and cap a 97-yard drive with 10 minutes left. \nPackers 17, 49ers 3 \nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Aaron Rodgers passed for 224 yards and a touchdown, ran 17 yards to set up a key second-half score, and Green Bay beat hapless San Francisco for its first 4-0 start in four years. \nRichard Rodgers caught a 9-yard touchdown pass on the game's opening drive before Rodgers got his team going in the second half after a slow start to snap a four-game losing streak to San Francisco, which included a pair of playoff defeats. \nClay Matthews added his own flair to this one. When he sacked Colin Kaepernick in the third quarter, he kissed his right biceps Kaepernick-style to punctuate the play — one of Green Bay's six sacks. \nWhile methodical with nothing fancy, Green Bay (4-0) seemed unfazed with a short week and long trip West after beating Kansas City last Monday night. \nBengals 36, Chiefs 21 \nCINCINNATI -- Andy Dalton added to his streak of impressive game and big plays, throwing a 55-yard touchdown pass on the run, and the Cincinnati Bengals stayed unbeaten. \nThe Bengals (4-0) matched the third-best start in franchise history, two wins shy of the club record. \nDalton has been the thread throughout the wins, ascending to the top of the AFC passer list. He had another spot-on day, completing 17 of 24 for 321 yards with the long touchdown pass to Brandon Tate during a scramble. \nIt was another rough day all around for Kansas City (1-3). Alex Smith was sacked five times, the Chiefs settled for Cairo Santos' club-record seven field goals, and the defense couldn't keep up with another one of the NFL's top passers. \nFalcons 48, Texans 21 \nATLANTA -- Devonta Freeman scored three more touchdowns and the Atlanta Falcons remained unbeaten, romping to a victory over hapless Houston. \nFreeman, who took over as the starting running back after rookie Tevin Coleman sustained a rib injury in Week 2, has scored six TDs in the last two games. The Falcons improved to 4-0 for only the fourth time in franchise history. \nFreeman had touchdown runs of 16, 23 and 6 yards. He set up another score with a 44-yard reception. \nNothing went right for the Texans (1-3). Quarterback Ryan Mallett was yanked after the Falcons built a 42-0 lead. Running back Arian Foster made his season debut after tearing his groin early in training camp, but he couldn't find any room to run. \nIn fact, he had the ball knocked out of his hands by one of his own teammates, leading to a Falcons touchdown. \nPanthers 37, Buccaneers 23 \nTAMPA, Fla. -- Cam Newton threw for two touchdowns and Josh Norman returned one of Carolina's four interceptions of Jameis Winston for his second TD of the season to help Carolina remain unbeaten. \nNewton tossed scoring passes of 6 and 12 yards to Ted Ginn Jr. A week after making a game-saving interception in the end zone against New Orleans, Norman scored on a 46-yard runback and later returned a another pick 34 yards to set up a second TD. \nTight end Ed Dickson rumbled 57 yards after recovering a fumble to score in the third quarter. \nThe Panthers improved to 4-0 for the first time since 2003, when they began with five straight victories. The Bucs (1-3), have lost five straight in the NFC South rivalry and have dropped 11 consecutive home games. \nRedskins 23, Eagles 20 \nLANDOVER, Md. -- Kirk Cousins threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garcon with 26 seconds left to give Washington the victory over Philadelphia. \nStarting at their own 10 with a little more than six minutes remaining, the Redskins (2-2) drove 90 yards on 15 plays to take the lead for good in a back-and-forth game. \nCousins finished 31 for 46 for 290 yards, the one TD — and, most importantly, no turnovers. He did fumble a snap in the first half at Philadelphia's 1, but recovered it himself and plunged forward for a touchdown, with the help of a big push from rookie running back Matt Jones. \nSam Bradford threw three second-half touchdown passes for the Eagles (1-3), but their new kicker, Caleb Sturgis, missed an extra-point attempt and a 33-yard field-goal try. \nGiants 24, Bills 10 \nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Rashad Jennings broke three tackles to score on a 51-yard touchdown catch midway through the fourth quarter to help New York seal the win at Buffalo. \nEli Manning went 20 of 35 for 212 yards and three touchdowns in leading the Giants (2-2) to their second straight win. New York's defense did the rest with Prince Amukamara stripping receiver Robert Woods of the ball to force a fumble with 3:41 left. \nThe Giants limited Buffalo to a combined 77 yards and two first downs on its first nine possessions. And then the Bills came away with no points on two drives into the red zone. \nThe second drive ended with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and J.T. Thomas stopping running back Karlos Williams for no gain on fourth-and-goal from the 1. \nThe Bills (2-2) were flagged 17 times for 135 yards. \nColts 16, Jaguars 13 (OT) \nINDIANAPOLIS -- Adam Vinatieri kicked a 27-yard field goal with 4:36 left in overtime to give Indianapolis the victory over Jacksonville and an NFL record-tying 15th consecutive win over a division opponent. \nThe 1972-73 Miami Dolphins also win 15 straight. \nMatt Hasselbeck made his first start since November 2012 in place of the injured Andrew Luck, and led the Colts (2-2) on a 53-yard march to step up the winning points. \nThe Jaguars (1-3) lined up twice for field goals with 6 seconds left in regulation, but Jason Myers' first attempt from 53 yards sailed wide right — just after the Colts had called timeout. Myers' second chance also went wide right. Then in overtime, his 48-yard attempt went wide left. \nHasselbeck took advantage of the field position to drive for the winning score. \nVinatieri became the first NFL player to reach 1,000 points with two different teams. \nJets 27, Dolphins 14 \nLONDON -- Chris Ivory ran for a career-high 166 yards and Ryan Fitzpatrick threw for 218, one touchdown and one interception to lead the New York over Miami at Wembley Stadium. \nMiami's Ndamukong Suh, the highest-paid defensive player in league history, had three tackles and no sacks. His first didn't come until the third quarter. \nBoth teams have byes next week, as usual for teams playing in London. Miami (1-3) will face lots of questions about its poor performances thus far. \nFitzpatrick threw for 172 yards in the first half, including a 58-yard completion to Brandon Marshall on the first play. Marshall had 107 yards receiving by halftime and finished with 128 for the Jets (3-1). \nThe Jets ended up with 207 yards rushing, including 34 from Fitzpatrick, and 425 total yards on offense. Ivory's 166 yards were the most by a Jet since Thomas Jones ran for 210 in 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:48:15.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
