Longhorns fans hope this game turns out a lot differently than last week's 50-7 debacle against TCU. \nThis week, the Longhorns play the Oklahoma Sooners in the Red River Rivalry game that, at least on paper, is heavily stacked in favor of OU. \nOffensively, Oklahoma is averaging 42 points and more than 521 yards per game thus far in 2015. The Sooners' attack is primarily coming through the air as the Sooners have put up an average of 358 passing yards per game along with 13 touchdowns and four interceptions in four games this year. \nTrying to stop the Sooners will be a porous defense that got torched by TCU last week. Texas gave up 50 points and over 600 yards of offense to the Horned Frogs and was never competitive in the game. \nBeware, Longhorns fans may want to hide their eyes from the following stats. \nTexas' defense on the season is giving up 507.2 yards per game, according to CFBStats.com . Texas ranks 120th out of 128 teams in the nation when it comes to total defense. The Horns are ranked only slightly better when it comes to scoring as the Longhorns rank 114th and are giving up 38.2 points per game on the season. \nThe Longhorns are especially vulnerable to the pass, giving up 296.6 yards through the air per game along with 16 touchdowns and just 5 interceptions through the first five games of the season. \nLas Vegas has installed the Sooners as a 16.5 point favorite over the Longhorns and has an over/under of 59.5 points for Saturday's game, meaning Oklahoma is a heavy favorite and expected to score a lot of points. \nTexas will try to recover from a social media mess and public criticism from players after last week's blowout loss to TCU. While UT head coach Charlie Strong has the support of everyone in the staff he needs, a blowout loss to Oklahoma could light a fire under Strong's seat as the Longhorns look at one of their worst records in decades.
