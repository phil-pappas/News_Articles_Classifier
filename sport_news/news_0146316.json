It’s a nervous business when the bye week comes, transactions are made and Patriots coach Bill Belichick is evaluating every position on the team — running back included.\nOn Tuesday, the Patriots hosted six free agents, including two backs: Montee Ball, formerly of the Broncos and a former teammate of White at the University of Wisconsin; and Darrin Reaves, an undrafted free agent who played last year with the Panthers.\nRelaxing isn’t going to really be that easy for White.\nYes, the second-year player with an ability to both run and catch out of the backfield played 17 offensive snaps against the Jaguars and he played well. He ran the ball twice for 8 yards, and caught four passes for 26 yards.\n“It was good,” he said. “I had the opportunity to get in the game and make plays for my team.”\nBut his team didn’t really need the help when he came in. The outcome was well in hand by the time White was inserted in the second half. He also does not play on special teams.\nNone of these signs — the free agent visits, the lack of meaningful playing time — are good for him.\nWhen asked about Ball, White was complimentary of his former teammate who could possibly be his replacement at any moment.\n“I know him really well,” White said. “I played with him in college and everything. He’s a good player. He’s a good guy.”\nHe’s a good guy whom might be White’s toughest competition when it comes to whether White will remain in Foxboro.\nAlthough he was released by the Broncos after an unproductive preseason, in his first two years in the league Ball rushed for 731 yards at 4.2 yards per carry to go along with 207 yards receiving. His numbers declined but he suffered a season-ending groin injury in 2014. It could still be bothering him, but how much is what the Patriots are likely trying to find out.\nReaves is a 5-foot-10, 215-pounder who only rushed for 78 yards and caught five passes for 31 in Carolina. But players aren’t just brought in for no reason, so maybe Belichick sees something in him others didn’t.\nWho knows?\nThe fact is, White doesn’t know. He did his best Wednesday to stick with the mantra he’s preached for himself since the offseason.\n“I’m just trying to have an aggressive approach,” he said of how he wants to play going forward.\nIt will be a little easier than trying to relax.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:09:46.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
