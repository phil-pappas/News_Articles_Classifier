As Hend ended at a superb 20-under 264, defending champion Lahiri (66) with seven birdies against two bogeys and his teammate Chiragh (65) with five birdies, an eagle and one bogey finished at 17-under 267 at the $1 million Asian Tour event. The other Indians also had a fine day as Rashid Khan (71) was tied eighth at 10-under 274 and Gaganjeet Bhullar (70) was tied 17th, as was SSP Chawrasia (72), who dropped two doubles and two bogeys on his back nine, including a double, bogey and bogey finish. Jyoti Randhawa (70) and Abhijit Chadha (75) were tied 45th. â€” Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:12:14.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
