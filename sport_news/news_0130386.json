Stations range from agricultural jeopardy to a homemade ice cream treat station made with products from the school's dairy cows.\nNeosho FFA advisor Jennifer Thogmartin emphasized that fewer and fewer people are involved in the agricultural process, so it's important to spark an early interest in the students.\n\"So much of what we do out here today isn't something they're going to learn in a classroom, so it gives them a hands-on opportunity and lets them interact with livestock and our high school students and farm machinery and equipment that they don't get to see, maybe ever, or any other time in their life,\" Martin said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:35:11.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
