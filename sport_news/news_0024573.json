The win improved Michigan to 5-1 on the season, dropping Northwestern to 5-1 as well.\nThe Wolverines are now 2-0 in conference play and look like a serious threat in the Big Ten, especially as Michigan State prepares to come to Ann Arbor next week. But next week is next week. Here's what you need to know about this week's decisive win.\n1. It was over early : Those tuning in hoping for a close game got a quick omen on how the game was actually going to go. Michigan's Jehu Chesson returned the opening kick 96 yards for a touchdown, and that was only the beginning. When the Wolverines offense finally had a chance to take the field, they took advantage, too. Michigan scored on its first two offensive possessions of the game to take a 21-0 lead before the first quarter was even over. \nJourdan Lewis (26) and the Michigan defense continue to dominate opponents. (USATSI) 2. Michigan's defense continues to be incredible : The Wolverines came into the game having shutout their last two opponents. The defense had been on the field for 30 consecutive possessions without allowing a single point, going back to Michigan's win over UNLV. Well, it's three straight shutouts now, and it's 42 consecutive possessions without allowing a point.\nThe last defense to shutout opponents in 12 straight quarters was the 2012 Alabama defense. Things worked out pretty well for that team, as it went on to win a national championship. The last time Michigan shutout three straight opponents was 1980. Michigan would finish 10-2 that season and win the Big Ten.\nI'm sure Wolverines fans would settle for the same fate this year, if not the national title that Alabama won.\n3. We may have been overrating Northwestern : OK, we definitely were. Yes, that season-opening win over Stanford was impressive, but since then, things haven't been all that amazing. Sure, the Wildcats were winning, but they were doing so against Duke, Ball State and Minnesota. I think we all just wanted Northwestern to be better than it was simply because that's what we do with underdogs.\nOn Saturday, things didn't go so well. The Northwestern defense did not play poorly, at least not by your typical statistical measure, but it wasn't very successful getting off the field, either. Michigan's offense had nine offensive possessions, four of which ended with points on the board, as the Wolverines were able to convert seven of 14 third downs. \nAgain, it's not a bad performance, but with the struggles Northwestern's offense has had all season, the Wildcats need their defense to be much better to win games against teams as good as Michigan. They did against Stanford. They did not today.\n4. Jim Harbaugh is never actually happy : Hey, Jim, your team is up 31-0, how do you feel?\n\nWell, all right then.\nTopics: Big Ten , Michigan Wolverines , Northwestern Wildcats , NCAAF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:05:45.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
