But the kick was low, and Patrick Gamble managed to get a hand on it. \nAustin picked up the ball inside the 25, then took it the other way for the score. \nNo. 5 LSU 48, WESTERN KENTUCKY 20 (at Baton Rouge, La.) — Brandon Harris passed for a career-high 286 yards, with two of his three scoring passes going for more than 50 yards, as LSU beat Western Kentucky. \nThe Tigers’ Leonard Fournette ran for 150 yards. \nNo. 6 CLEMSON 58, MIAMI 0 (at Miami Gardens, Fla.) — Deshaun Watson threw a touchdown pass and ran for another score to help the Tigers hand the Hurricanes their worst loss ever. \nWayne Gallman ran for 118 yards and a touchdown for the Tigers (7-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). \nNo. 2 BAYLOR 45, IOWA STATE 27 (at Waco, Texas) — Shock Linwood ran for 171 yards and a touchdown, caught a pass for another score and the Bears earned their FBS-best 20th consecutive home victory. \nBaylor’s win may have come at a high price. Quarterback Seth Russell, who began the game as the national leader in passing efficiency, suffered a fracture in one of the bones of his neck. \nHe will see a specialist this week. \nNo. 14 OKLAHOMA ST. 58, KANSAS 10 (at Stillwater, Okla.) — Backup quarterback J.W. Walsh ran for three touchdowns and passed for two more scores for the Cowboys, hours after a fatal crash near the stadium during homecoming festivities. \nAt least three people were killed and dozens injured when a woman plowed a car into a crowd at the homecoming parade. \nNo. 8 ALABAMA 19, TENNESSEE 14 (at Tuscaloosa, Ala.) — Derrick Henry had a 14-yard touchdown run with 2:24 left to lift the Crimson Tide. \nAlabama’s aggressive defense then made two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Volunteers QB Joshua Dobbs to preserve the victory. \nNo. 23 DUKE 45, VIRGINIA TECH 43, 4 OT (at Blacksburg, Va.) — Thomas Sirk threw four touchdown passes and ran for a two-point conversion in the fourth overtime to lift the Blue Devils. \nSirk hit Erich Schneider with a 25-yard scoring pass on the first play of the fourth overtime, after the Hokies had scored and missed the mandatory two-point attempt.
