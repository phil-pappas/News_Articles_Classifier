They were wrong. It’s all about how good you look.\nThat’s why the hockey world is rejoicing after ice hockey legend Jaromir Jagr announced he is bringing back the most recognisable hairstyle the sport has ever been privileged enough to witness.\nForget the Kyrgios Neapolitan look, David Beckham’s mohawk, Kevin Naiqama’s Marge Simpson impersonation or Ronaldo’s, well, we don’t know what to call the Brazilian striker’s ridiculous excuse for a haircut, but it sure made him stand out.\nIs that a haircut or a high-rise apartment building?

The Czech star, who now plays for the Florida Panthers, plied his trade for numerous clubs in a decorated career both in America and for his national side.\nHe first sported the do when he played for the Pittsburgh Penguins back in 1990, and established himself as one of the most potent attacking weapons in the NHL. His ability to find the net so regularly despite having those long flowing locks flying dangerously close to his eyes is one of sport’s greatest achievements (well, maybe not, but you get the gist).\nJagr’s locks were as admired as his goal-scoring ability. Source: Getty Images\nJagr got rid of the much-loved mullet at the end of the 1998-1999 season, in which he racked up 127 points, apparently to appease his girlfriend (who can blame him, we all know girlfriends can be scarier than a bunch of angry blokes with skates and sticks anyway).\nHowever, his returns since then have been less than what the 43-year-old has hoped for, and he knows only one way to revive his fortunes.\n“Since then I couldn’t score,” Jagr is Quote: d as saying in the Sun Sentinel .\n“I’m not going to cut my hair, that’s all. The power of the hair is coming back. Samson is coming back. I just want to find out if it’s the hair or just me that was good.’’\nThis news made Panthers teammate Roberto Luongo happier than a journalist with an extended deadline, because the goalie had stated in the pre-season that it was his mission to convince Jagr to give the fans, and the players, what they wanted.\nI will make it my mission this year, work 24h around the clock 2 get Jags to bring this puppy back! It&apos;s gonna happen pic.twitter.com/NcAiEzmtmU\n— Strombone (@strombone1) September 16, 2015 Now, you get the feeling that even Luongo won’t care whether his team wins or loses, because they’ll have one of sport’s great haircuts on their side.\nGuys we did it https://t.co/tdgh5FWTet\n— Strombone (@strombone1) October 5, 2015 Jagr is the active scoring leader with a whopping 722 goals, and while he hasn’t had a haircut in three months, he’s admitted it might take a full season for his follicles to sprout something that resembles his former glory.\nJagr isn’t the only sportsman to have repped the mullet on the global stage. There have been some absolute crackers over the years, and here are some of the best.\nAndre Agassi and his mullet go together like strawberries and cream.
