He is done for the season.\nAdam Wainwright, St. Louis' No. 1 starter when the season opened, tore his left Achilles tendon while batting in an April 25 game at Milwaukee. Expected to miss the rest of the season, Wainwright returned as a relief pitcher on Sept. 30 and allowed 1 run on 2 hits over 3 innings in 3 appearances. The right-hander will be in the Cardinals' bullpen for the NLDS and is hoping to come on in \"high leverage\" situations.\nMatt Adams (quad strain), Stephen Piscotty (concussion) and Randal Grichuk (elbow strain) are all expected to be ready to play against the Cubs.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
