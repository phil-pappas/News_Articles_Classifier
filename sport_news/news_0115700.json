Overall, though, I felt like we had a good night and a win's a win.\" \nWhile still not mathematically official, East Coweta has all but clinched a state berth and got a boost from Westlake’s 36-35 overtime win over Hughes in a comeback. \nThe Indians are now among four teams tied atop 3- with 4-1 records while holding a head-to-head advantage over Westlake (4-1) and with a chance to do the same against Newnan next week. \nThe Indians opened the game with a nine-play drive that was capped off with a 33-yard run by Jeremiah Gemmel to make it 7-0 with 7:12 to play in the first quarter. Douglas County answered quickly with a four-play drive led by Malik Oliver, who finished the drive with an eight-yard touchdown run to tie the game at 7 with 6:13 to go in the opening quarter. \nDouglas County had a chance to take the lead after a partially blocked punt gave them the ball inside Indians' territory, but the Tigers missed a 37-yard field goal. East Coweta took over and took control of the game. The Indians scored in four plays, with Calvin Kirby taking the ball in from 12 yards away to make it 14-7 Indians with eight seconds to go in the first. \nFrom that point, the rout was on for East Coweta. The Indians scored 21 points in the second quarter. The first score came with 8:33 to go in the half when, following a muffed punt that East Coweta recovered at the Tigers' 45-yard line, Carlos Ford busted through the middle of the Tigers' defense for a 13-yard score and a 21-7 Indians lead. They extended the lead to 28-7 with 3:50 left in the first half on a Carlos Reid 1-yard run. \nA scoring drive was highlighted by a 45-yard completion from Reid to Justin Crump. Crump would get in the end zone himself on East Coweta's next drive. The Indians drove 90 yards, and Reid hit Crump for a three-yard score with 13 seconds to play in the half, making the score 35-7 at the break. Douglas County tried to \nmake it interesting to open the second half as Charles Gadie went 65 yards for a touchdown on the kickoff to cut the lead to 35-13. \nEast Coweta, however, quickly answered with a six-play drive that was finished off by Ford’s 1-yard run to make it 42-13 for the Indians with 8:56 to go in the third. Douglas County scored late with a 64-yard run from D.J. Avery with 6:30 left in the game to make it 42-20 East Coweta. \n\"We said it all week: ‘There's an elephant in the room and it's Newnan,’\" Pardue said. \"Now we can focus on Newnan. We have a lot of kids banged up, but you kind of feel like maybe they will get better a little faster because it's such a big game.” \nINDIANS 42, TIGERS 7 \nDouglas Co. 7 0 67—20 1st Quarter \nEC- Jeremiah Gemmel 29 run \n(Wyatt Palmer kick), 7:12 \nDC- Malik Oliver 8 run (Austin Blair kick), 6:13 \nEC- Calvin Kirby 12 run (Palmer kick), 0:08 \n2nd Quarter \nEC- Carlos Ford 13 run (Palmer kick), 8:33 \nEC- Christian Reid 1 run (Palmer kick), 3:50 \nEC- Justin Crump 3-yard pass from Reid (Palmer kick), 0:13 \n3rd Quarter \nDC- Charles Gadie 65-yard kick return (kick failed), 11:45 \nEC- Ford 1 run (Palmer kick), 8:56 \n4th Quarter \nDC- D.J.
