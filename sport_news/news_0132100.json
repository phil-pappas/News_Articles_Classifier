And I am still, as well, even though I’ve got the Tampa Bay Rays,’’ Sternberg told the audience Wednesday at Citi Field, where he introduced MLB commissioner Rob Manfred at the 2015 Sports Diversity & Inclusion Symposium.\nSternberg was born and raised in Canarsie, and one of his favorite memories is attending his first major league game at Shea Stadium in 1965 with his father and getting to watch Sandy Koufax pitch. Even after making enough money to lead a group that took over the Rays from Vincent Naimoli in 2005, he didn’t leave New York — he lives in Rye with his wife and four children — and didn’t lose his love of the Mets.\n“In Major League Baseball we try to have local ownership in places, but when we bought the team, George Steinbrenner was running the Yankees from Tampa, so I figured I could run the Tampa Bay Rays from New York,’’ Sternberg said.\n  mlb ,  new york mets ,  tampa bay rays", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:27:12.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
