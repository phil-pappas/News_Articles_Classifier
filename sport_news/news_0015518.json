It was during the night because I was back in Russia and it was a little bit of shock.\"\nThen there was another call the following night, one that came as an equal shock -- the Hawks wanted to sign Anisimov to a long-term extension. Anisimov had no idea the Hawks thought so highly of him. General manager Stan Bowman said after the trade Anisimov was a player he had wanted to acquire for years.\n\"That call ruined the second night of sleep,\" Anisimov said.\nWhen he cleared the dust from his eyes, Anisimov signed an extension that will keep him a Blackhawk through 2021.\nAnisimov is finally getting settled in Chicago. His wife and two children were scheduled to move to the city Sunday, giving him some much-needed peace of mind.\nAnisimov has been centering the Hawks' most productive line with wingers Artemi Panarin and Patrick Kane. Anisimov helps to translate on the ice for Panarin, a fellow Russian native who speaks little English.\nAnisimov's eyes lit up when talking about his linemates.\n\"I really like this line. It's two skilled guys,\" Anisimov said. \"I'm the centerman. I just need to give them the puck.\"\nCoach Joel Quenneville has liked what he has seen from Anisimov.\n\"He's playing with two special players, and I think with his thought process on both sides of the puck, he positions himself well,\" Quenneville said. \"He sustains a lot of pucks. He's available and lets the other guys do their thing as well.\"\nAnisimov is the big-bodied second-line center the Hawks have been lacking for a long time, but that's now a need the Hawks hope they have filled for years to come.\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1740248&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1740248&h=Center+Artem+Anisimov+fitting+in+nicely+with+Blackhawks", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1740248"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:42:32.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
