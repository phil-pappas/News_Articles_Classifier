Siaosi is really a student of the game and hes really smart in calling out what the defense is bringing.”\nUtah QB Travis Wilson\nSALT LAKE CITY — Utah center Siaosi Aiono is more than just the man in the middle up front for the third-ranked Utes . The senior directs adjustments on an offensive line that has surrendered just seven sacks this season — tied for the fewest allowed in the Pac-12.\n“He’s been great. Siaosi is really a student of the game and he’s really smart in calling out what the defense is bringing,” said quarterback Travis Wilson. “He’s kind of the quarterback on that offensive line and he’s been doing a great job of making sure I’m staying protected.”\nLast week, right tackle J.J. Dielman referred to Siaosi as the “brains of the organization” on the line and called him a “wizard” for the way he does things.\nSiaosi, though, declines to call himself a ‘wiz’ or anything like it. He insists they all do well and it’s all about communication in the trenches.\nUtah entered last week’s game against Arizona State having allowed just two sacks. The heavy blitzing Sun Devils managed to get to Wilson five times. Even so, the Utes threw for 297 yards in a 34-18 victory.\n“That was a big emphasis for us in the offseason, was to get our passing game going and it always starts with the O-line protecting the quarterback,” Siaosi said. “So I feel like we did all right. Obviously we’re not proud of five sacks. We’ve just got to get back on it the next game.”\nUtah takes on USC Saturday in Los Angeles.\nHOME, SWEET HOME: Whittingham reminded reporters there are two types of coaches wives — really good ones and ex-ones. He made it clear where his wife, Jamie , sits.\n“She’s a really good one,” he said, while expressing appreciation for her support. “She keeps me grounded.”\nEXTRA POINTS: After practice Tuesday, Whittingham said the team “has a lot of energy right now” and is going through its routine in preparing for a road trip . . . Utah’s home game against Oregon State on Halloween will kickoff at 5 p.m. It’ll be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks . . . The Utes haven’t defeated the Trojans in Los Angeles since a 27-12 decision in 1916.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com \nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:25:22.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
