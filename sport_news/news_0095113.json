Woburn survives in Belmont; improves to 2-2 By STEVE ALGERI   \nBELMONT — At this stage it is still hard to say which way this Woburn High football season could swing. \nSure, the Tanners are now 2-2 after Friday night’s 18-15 win in Belmont for their second in a row, but it all depends on how healthy they are the rest of the way. \nUnlike when it played at Burlington without some key offensive backs and got pounded, Woburn played without two starting linemen but was lucky to survive. \nDepth is always talked about in football but your starters are your starters and obviously teams are much better off with their better players in the line-up. Friday night against a Belmont team Woburn figured to have an advantage over, the Tanners played without veteran starting linemen Nick Dangora and Gabe Soares and their absence was felt. But in the end it was not costly. \nWoburn went to 2-0 in the Middlesex League Liberty Division with the victory but the next three weeks will be crucial for not only the Liberty Division but also for the MIAA playoffs with games at Arlington, at Reading and then home to Melrose. Those three teams have combined records of 10-2. \nCurrently, Woburn is sixth in the Division 3 Northwest power ratings. The top eight make the playoffs. \n“I credit Belmont for doing an unbelievable job, they came to play,” said Woburn coach Rocky Nelson who moved one win away from his 200th career win. “We sure got a wakeup call. They dominated the first half, I thought. And then we came out and did a little bit better. Then we screw up and give them a long score when I thought the game was over, and then we had to hang on.” \nWoburn trailed 7-6 heading into the fourth quarter. However, the Tanners put together a time-consuming 15-play, 80-yard drive that began with 7:18 left in the third quarter and ate up just about eight minutes off the clock. \nBrandon Moscat, Doug Amaral, Nick Patti and Tim Concannon all contributed in the series. Amaral banged over from the one for the touchdown and although the pass for the two-point conversion failed, Woburn led, 12-7, early in the final quarter. \nWoburn’s defense then forced a three-and-out and Moscat alertly made a fair catch of a short punt to set Woburn up at midfield with 9:23 to play. \nMoscat had the big run on a toss sweep to the left that he took for 34 yards to the Belmont 19. Patti, the fullback, had a quick hitter up the middle for 12 yards and a first down at the Belmont one. \nThe touchdown didn’t come easy as it took until third down for the Tanners to score and that came from Concannon on a silent count on a QB sneak. With Dangora out of the lineup, that also meant he had to be replaced as a kicker and the try for the PAT was wide right. However, at 18-7 and with 5:47 to play, Woburn had what looked like a pretty good cushion. \nThe cushion the Tanners thought they had changed one play later. Belmont senior tailback Mekhai Johnson is a pretty good looking runner. He was a workhorse with 25 carries for 157 yards. His best one of the night came on the first down play after the ensuing Woburn kickoff from his own 26. \nWith the Tanners looking for Belmont, which was down two scores, to pass, Johnson took a handoff to the left with a lot of running run. He sped down the left sideline all the way for the touchdown. Johnson also ran in the two-point conversion making it an 18-15 game. \nStill plenty of time left and there certainly were some anxious moments for the Tanners before it was all over. \nWoburn was able to eat some clock by picking up a first down and got into Belmont territory with under three minutes left. But, the Tanners got a little too cute with their execution in the backfield and a fumble resulted with Belmont recovering on its own 36-yard line with 2:37 to play. \nBelmont has a fine QB in junior Cal Christofori, who is also one of the better all around athletes that school has had in recent years. He is certainly a threat to win the game with the ball in his hands. \nA first-down pass to Johnson picked up nine yards. On second down the Woburn defense brought some pressure and had the coverage on the receivers. A.J. Crawford was able to push a scrambling Christofori out of bounds after a loss of one yard. \nOn third down Concannon, the third-year starting safety for the Tanners, timed the play perfectly and broke up a slant pass for wide receiver Rob Aiello. This brought up fourth and two. \nThe handoff went to Johnson to the right but the Woburn defense was in place and Moscat from his cornerback spot stopped the Belmont running back by the sideline for a loss of one giving his team back the ball with 2:10 to play. \nWoburn ran the clock down just about to the end. A great punt by replacement punter (Dangora also punts) Joey Domenici that rolled and was downed at the Belmont three gave the Marauders just one play to go 97 yards. After a short completion by Belmont and trying to do some laterals, the Woburn defense made the stop to end the game. \n“We got out of here (with a win) and hopefully we are going to be at full strength next week,” said Nelson. “We certainly missed Nick (Dangora), and (Gabe) Soares, and hopefully we get them back; that will make a big difference.” \nBelmont looked very good early. Even though Woburn stopped a 16-play opening drive that went over nine minutes, the Marauders were unfazed. \nWoburn scored the first touchdown and Belmont cannot be happy with the occurrence. On fourth and nine from the Belmont 24, Concannon floated a perfect pass near the back of the end zone to Woburn wide receiver Kevin Stachowski who caught it for the TD. \nBut, Belmont answered on its next series on a 10-play drive with Christofori converting two third downs with pass completions. Johnson capped the scoring drive with a one-yard run for the TD. Aidan Cadogan connected on the extra point with 1:30 left in the half for a 7-6 Belmont lead. \nThat is how it stood until early in the fourth when the Tanners took control of the game and then held on. \nAfter some early struggles in the game both offensively and defensively, the Tanners settled in and got into a better flow with their personnel and schemes as the game went on. Still, Woburn does not look like a team that can afford multiple injuries to key players in any single game to be overly successful. \n“We’ve gotten some depth and experience and we got out of here (with a win) and now we are on to Arlington,” said Nelson. \nFriday’s game in Arlington is a 7 p.m. kickoff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:33:26.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
