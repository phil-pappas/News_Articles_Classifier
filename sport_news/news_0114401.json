Comment By Kevin J. Stone/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By Kevin J. Stone/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 9:45 PM By Kevin J. Stone/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 9:45 PM MEDWAY — With just a few matches left in the regular season and a tournament berth already safely secured, the Medway girls volleyball team is simply looking to use the remainder of its schedule as a resume-builder for a higher seed. On Tuesday night, the Mustangs made quick work of Tri-Valley League rival Ashland, sweeping the Clockers 3-0 (25-16, 25-18, 25-15) in just one hour for a fifth consecutive victory since losing to TVL power Hopkinton on Oct. 7. With four matches left, Medway is sitting pretty at 12-2 overall and 10-2 in the TVL. Meanwhile, Ashland falls to 7-7 overall and 5-7 in league play. \"We know when we play inside of our system we're a pretty good team,\" Medway coach Gary Patch said. \"So, this time of year when you get a chance to really fine-tune your game and start getting prepped for the tournament it's nice. It's good that we can get a lot of players on the floor and really just focus on our game and not have to worry about fighting for a tournament berth. “We'd like to get a higher seed this year so we can avoid some of the upper-echelon teams unlike years past where we've had some tough early match-ups.\" Medway was never really in any jeopardy of losing any of the games Tuesday, but the third game may have been the most entertaining. Early on, an ace from senior Dalia Marmash gave the Clockers a 3-2 lead. That lead would increase to 6-3 before the Mustangs began to make a move. Down 8-7, an ace from senior Riana Pozsgai and a kill from junior Jessica Jubb (6 kills) put Medway up 9-8. The Clockers fought back, getting an ace from sophomore Sarah Labbe to tie things at 10-10. Minutes later, a pretty touch at the net for a kill from junior Kendall Palin put the Clockers up 12-11. Medway quickly ended any thoughts of Ashland forcing a fourth game, however, going on an 11-2 run to take a commanding 22-14 lead. Moments later, a kill from junior Katherine Dickie gave Medway the sweep. \"We feel like we have a really good team dynamic going right now,\" Jubb said. \"Everyone is doing a really good job of just feeding off of each other and we really think we're playing our best when it counts the most heading towards the tournament.\" It seemed as if Ashland was going to make life difficult for Medway in the second game, jumping out to leads of 4-1 and 6-4, but a kill from junior Shannon McHugh gave the Mustangs a 7-6 lead — a lead it would never relinquish. Medway went on to build leads of 11-9, 17-13, and 21-16. Some sloppy play and mishits at the net allowed Ashland to hang around a bit at 24-18, but an ace from senior Corinne Carbone gave Medway the 25-18 win and 2-0 lead. Page 2 of 2 - \"There's just something about Medway High School that doesn't like us,\" Ashland coach Jay Warren joked. \"I thought we could have played better at times tonight, but that's a great team and they just always seem to have a good night in this gym against us.\" Medway delivered a dominant performance in the first game, getting out to early leads of 8-2 and then 12-8. Back-to-back kills by sophomore Riley Childs (11 kills) moments later gave Medway a 17-10 lead. After an Ashland timeout, back-to-back aces by Carbone made it 19-10 Mustangs. A thunderous kill from freshman Maegan Hladick ended Game 1 at 25-16. Medway seems to be hitting its full stride at the perfect time of year, and Tuesday night's performance against Ashland has the squad feeling good about the weeks ahead. \"We're a really focused team right now,\" Jubb said. \"We've done a good job of focusing on one point at a time, one game at a time, and one match at a time, and we feel like we're really putting ourselves in a good spot to do some big things in the tournament.\" By Kevin J.
