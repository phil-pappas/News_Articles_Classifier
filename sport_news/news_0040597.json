(By: Rick McFarland) Photo Gallery View \nThe Class 6A Bulldogs (6-0, 3-0 7A/6A-Central) led 35-12 at halftime and quickly applied the Arkansas Activities Association's sportsmanship rule in the third quarter. \nHales, the nephew of Little Rock Christian football Coach Jeff Weaver, threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver Garrett Collins on the first play from scrimmage of the third quarter, then followed with an 11-yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Drew Dundee. \nJunior Jarrod Cooper kicked the extra point after Hales' touchdown pass to Dundee to give Greenwood a 49-12 lead with 7:48 remaining in third quarter and invoke the sportsmanship rule (a running clock when the score differential reaches at least 35 points in the second half). \nHales finished 10 of 15 passing for 270 yards. He ran 7 times for 39 yards, including a 1-yard touchdown on Greenwood's fifth play from scrimmage. \nGreenwood played without standout senior tailback Jordan Green (abdominal issue), but still finished with 645 total yards on 63 plays. They ran for 306 and passed for 339. \n\"Conway's a good football team,\" Greenwood Coach Rick Jones said after his 264th career victory. \"We know that. We caught them on a good night for us. That's about all you can say.\" \nSenior wide receiver Ryan Padilla caught 6 passes for 177 yards and 2 first-half touchdowns (55 and 85 yards). Senior tailback Caden Martin ran 7 times for 110 yards and a 78-yard touchdown to give Greenwood a 28-9 lead with 8:18 left in the first half. \nThe last two meetings between the Bulldogs and Class 7A Wampus Cats (3-3, 2-1) had been decided by a combined seven points. \nBut Conway fell behind 14-0 early Friday, trailed 21-6 after one quarter and never threatened. \n\"Boy, it's going to be hard to find anything positive,\" Conway Coach Clint Ashcraft said. \"We've got a lot of work to do. We're not a very good football team right now.\" \nConway senior quarterback Breylin Smith completed 15 of 27 passes for 205 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown to senior wide receiver Tanner Thone with 3:23 left in the third quarter. \nSenior Christian Underwood kicked field goals of 37 and 28 yards in the first half. \nJunior tailback McCall Dail ran 11 times for 78 yards, including a 64-yard touchdown to pull Conway within 14-6 with 4:51 left in the first quarter. \nBut Greenwood pulled away as Hales threw an 85-yard touchdown pass to Padilla with 2:10 left in the first quarter. They had teamed for a 55-yard touchdown with 6:22 left in the first quarter. \nMartin swept right end for a 78-yard touchdown, and a 28-9 lead, with 8:18 left in the first half. \nJunior tailback Daylon Hood ran 11 yards for a touchdown on a draw play with 25 seconds left in the second quarter to make it 35-12 at halftime. \nThe Bulldogs finished the first half with 389 total yards. \nSophomore quarterback Connor Noland scored Greenwood's final touchdown on a 56-yard run on the first play of the fourth quarter. \nSports on 10/10/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:07:33.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
