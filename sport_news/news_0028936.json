Defenseman Dougie Hamilton wired home a wrist-shot for his first goal as a member of the Flames.\nVancouver took the lead with a pair of goals in the second period. Horvat tallied his first career powerplay goal at the 2:03 mark as he got his own rebound and fired it home past Jonas Hiller. Shortly past the midway mark, McCann took a feed from Jannik Hansen and put a perfect wrister past Hiller for his first NHL goal.\nThe Flames held the edge in play in the third period and with 11:11 to play, they were rewarded. Sean Monahan beat Ryan Miller with a quick shot to make it a 2-2 game.\nVancouver started its first three-on-three overtime game with Henrik Sedin, Daniel Sedin and Matt Bartkowski on the ice. Early in the extra session Henrik set up Daniel at the side of the goal, but Hiller made a sprawling pad save to keep the game going. That save allowed Gaudreau to force a turnover and beat Miller short-side for the game-winner.\nMiller made 35 saves in the loss, while Hiller turned aside 28 shots.\nThe Canucks will head out on the road to take on the Anaheim Ducks on Monday.\nCanucks | hockey | Local Sports | nhl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:06:06.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
