I think it’s a nice addition to our stadium.”\nJared Norris The new playing surface received positive reviews Monday after the Utah Utes practice on it for the first time. It’ll make its game debut Saturday against California.\n“The players seemed to like it, the kickers like it, so I think it’s a big plus for us,” said Utah coach Kyle Whittingham, who noted that the field is much softer than the previous version. “I think it’ll be good for us.”\nRunning back Devontae Booker and linebacker Jared Norris agreed.\n“It felt great running out here today on it,” said Booker, who added that he’s excited to play on it.\nNorris also thinks it’ll work out well. However, he acknowledged it’ll take some time to get acclimated to it after a little slipping and sliding in practice.\nJared Norris\n“It’s a little softer but I think it’s nice,” Norris said. “I think it’s a nice addition to our stadium.”\nMONDAY’S PRACTICE: After a week off from competition, Whittingham said it was good to get the Utes back on the field again. Following Monday’s practice, though, he admitted there’s work to be done.\n“We’ve got a ways to go. It’s good we have the extra day this week. We could use it,” said Whittingham, who explained that Mondays are typically used for conditioning, lifts and meetings. “After any bye week, it’s a little bit of a process getting them back. It takes a day or two.”\nDIMICK’S RETURN: After missing two games with an undisclosed leg injury, starting defensive end Hunter Dimick is expected to play against Cal.\n“We hope he’s at or near 100 percent,” Whittingham said. “He will be back. At least that’s the report today.”\nDimick told reporters it was a pretty big relief to go out and practice. He said that team trainers strongly suggested that he not play against Oregon on Sept. 26.\nWhittingham praised Kylie Fitts and Filipo Mokofisi for stepping in and doing a great job in Dimick’s absence.\nEXTRA POINTS: Whittingham said that having ESPN’s “College GameDay” program on President’s Circle this weekend is great for the program and university. For a schedule of activities associated with the broadcast got to: www.utahutes.com . . . Utah’s 62-20 win over Oregon was Whittingham’s 89th at the helm, moving him past Ron McBride for the second most career wins in school history. Ike Armstrong is first with 141 . . . Safety Marcus Williams leads the Pac-12 with 0.8 interceptions per game.\n ", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:06:29.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
