They aren’t close this season. But the quality of USC’s offensive plays has trumped the quantity.\nUSC is averaging just 66 plays per game entering Thursday’s contest against Washington. Only the Huskies, at 59.8, average fewer among Pac-12 teams.\nBut the Trojans lead the conference in total offense with 532.0 yards per game. They rank second in the nation behind Baylor in yards per play (8.06).\n“Obviously you want the ball more,” USC quarterback Cody Kessler said. “We’d like to have the ball. But a lot of it is due to our explosive plays. We’re making a lot of plays where we’re getting down the field really fast.”\nWhen the Trojans have scored, they generally have scored quickly. The average length of their 26 scoring drives this season is 1 minute, 57 seconds. Their longest is 3:46.\nThe website CFBStats.com tracks “long” plays in increments of 10 yards. USC is tied for 17th in the nation with 30 scrimmage plays of 20 or more yards. The Trojans are tied for 30th with 79 plays of 10-plus yards. In both instances, all but two of the teams ahead of USC have played five games; the Trojans have played only four.\n“We’re getting yards in chunks, which, going into this season, was a huge goal,” Sarkisian said. “We wanted to get bigger plays, be a more explosive offense.\n“Would I love to run 80 plays? Of course. But I don’t want to sacrifice the explosiveness of our team.”\nThe other factor limiting USC’s offense plays is third-down percentage. Before the Arizona State game, the Trojans had converted only 30.8 percent of their third downs. A 10-of-16 performance against ASU raised that figure to 42.9 percent.\n“If we can get that up to near 50,” Sarkisian said, “that’ll get us more plays.”\n\nFAMILIAR FRESHMAN \n\nAs ASU proved against UCLA’s Josh Rosen last week, it pays to pressure a freshman quarterback. That’s USC’s primary goal against Washington’s Jake Browning.\n\n“He’s got the arm strength, the accuracy to reach everywhere,” Trojans linebacker Cameron Smith said. “We’ll need to get in his head and get him rattled a little bit.”\n\nSmith knows what it’s like to face Browning, having done so twice in high school. The two played at rival schools in Granite Bay. Did Smith expect they’d both be starting as freshmen in a nationally televised Pac-12 game?\n\n“You hope for that,” he said. “But definitely not.”\n\nThe departure of Cyler Miles forced Washington coach Chris Petersen to look at alternatives at quarterback. He chose to start Browning, who has completed 65 percent of his passes for 996 yards with five touchdowns and four interceptions.\n“I like Jake a lot,” said Sarkisian, who recruited Browning while at UW. “Jake’s got a good feel for the game. He’s a tough kid. He’s heady. And he’s gotten better from week to week to week. He’s going to be a heck of a player in our conference.”\nQUICK HITS \nDefensive lineman Claude Pelon got tangled with an offensive lineman during scout-team work and took a hard fall, injuring his right ankle. Pelon limped to the sideline and eventually left the field on a cart. Sarkisian said Pelon at least has a sprain and will undergo further tests. … Sarkisian said he feels good about cornerback Kevon Seymour (knee) playing against Washington. … The status of receiver Darreus Rogers (hamstring) is less certain. Rogers hasn't practiced all week. … Freshman linebacker John Houston Jr., who's redshirting, did not practice because of a sore back. … With Khaliel Rodgers back and manning the second-team center spot, Toa Lobendahn (La Habra High) returned to right guard with the first unit. … Tailback Justin Davis got a lot of work with the first team on what was a light day for listed starter Tre Madden (Mission Viejo). … USC worked out in shoulder pads and shorts after going in full pads Saturday and Sunday.\nContact the writer: mlev@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:29:12.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
