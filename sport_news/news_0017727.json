Trailing 20-10 to start the fourth quarter, the Falcons stormed back with 14 points in the final 15 minutes of action to claim the victory. The offensive line was crucial in the victory, hitting important blocks which enabled two goal line rushing scores in the contest.\nChicago Bears: Martellus Bennett, TE\nMarty B received six targets, coming down with four receptions and 48 yards in a 48-23 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Bennett and the Bears now sit 0-2 for the season with both losses coming at home. Things won't get any easier in the Windy City after QB Jay Cutler went out with an injury to his hamstring and is expected to miss two weeks.\nJimmy Clausen will be the expected starter with Cutler out.\nThe injury occurred after Cutler targeted Bennett on a pass which was thrown behind the tight end and intercepted.\nJay Cutler (hamstring) will miss at least 2 weeks. Jimmy Clausen will start at QB for Bears.

Either way, the Manziel Era looks to be underway in Cleveland.\nIt didn't always look pretty ( seriously, how do you even get your body in this position as a QB ), but at the end of the day Manziel had compiled an 8-of-15 day good for 172 yards and two scores, including what appears to be a weekly down-field hookup with Browns WR Travis Benjamin.\nThe biggest takeaway I had in the Cleveland victory for Manziel is that he appears to be developing his game from inside the pocket. Rather than rely on the antics that made him a success at A&M on every play, the QB is learning to move through his progressions and read defenses. If Manziel can learn to use his scrambling and improvisation abilities in the right situations rather than rely on his elusiveness as a crutch, he may have a shot in this league after all.\nBrowns head coach Mike Pettine definitely seems to be using the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner as a game manager rather than attempting to rely on his arm. The plan paid off on Sunday with Manziel claiming his first career victory with a 28-14 win over the Titans.\nokay...THAT pass with the game on the line suggests Johnny Football can bring that Texas A&M magic to the NFL...\n— Michael Wilbon (@RealMikeWilbon) September 20, 2015\nGame on the line: @JManziel2 spins to left out of trouble and finds fantasy darling Travis Benjamin for game sealing 50-yard TD. Superb.\n— Rich Eisen (@richeisen) September 20, 2015\nManziel should only throw deep bombs to Travis Benjamin\n— Chris B. Brown (@smartfootball) September 20, 2015\nYOU. ALREADY. KNOW. pic.twitter.com/or7q8ePbjJ\n— Robby Kalland (@RKalland) September 20, 2015 Denver Broncos: Von Miller, LB\nIn his fifth season out of Texas A&M, the second overall pick for the Broncos in 2011 has become one of the dominant forces in the NFL. Denver improved to 2-0 with a 31-24 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. Miller had four tackles on the afternoon, including a tackle for loss.\nChiefs QB Alex Smith finished the game with a QB Rating of 7.4\nHouston Texans: Randy Bullock, K and Shane Lechler, P\nThe season hasn't gotten off to an ideal start for the Texans with the 24-17 loss to the Panthers bringing their record to 0-2 on the young season. The team has already made a switch at QB, going from former Cleveland Brown Brian Hoyer in week 1 to Ryan Mallett against Carolina.\nThe offense struggled, as evident by Lechler's eight punts on the afternoon good for 388 total yards. He pinned three kicks inside the 20. As for Bullock, two extra points and a 43-yard field goal capped off his perfect day.\nMiami Dolphins: Ryan Tannehill, QB\nA look around Twitter and you'll see many Dolphins fans that believe their QB is one of the top signal-callers in the league with many favoring the former A&M WR/QB over current Colts star Andrew Luck.\nAfter signing a big offseason extension, the front office likely expects the same caliber of play. The offensive line has struggled, which hasn't allowed much time for Tannehill to find his open receivers.\nAfter a loss to the Jaguars on Sunday, Miami also fell off pace in the division after the Patriots improved to 2-0 with a win over the Bills. Tannehill completed 30 of 44 passes on the afternoon for 359 yards and two scores.\nWhat a time to be alive. Texas A&M is the only football program to have more than 1 QB start in the NFL today. pic.twitter.com/mUwjoROtwP\n— AggieFBLife (@aggiefblife) September 21, 2015 San Diego Chargers: Josh Lambo, K\nThe Chargers fall to 1-1 after a 24-19 loss to the Bengals.\nLambo had a field goal try sail wide left from 47 yards out after hitting his first two kicks of the day. He is now four out of five in both field goals and extra point attempts on the season, good for 16 total points so far in the 2015 campaign.\nSeattle Seahawks: Michael Bennett, DE\nThe Seahawks are still looking for their first W since the NFC Championship game last season, falling to the Green Bay Packers 27-17 on the evening and 0-2 on the season.\nDespite taking a 17-16 lead into the fourth quarter, Seattle couldn't pull off the victory over the Packers. Bennett had a rather quiet evening but did manage to record two tackles including a sack on Aaron Rodgers.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: Mike Evans, WR\nEvans was on a snap count, according to reports , in a game that saw QB Jameis Winston claim his first career victory in a 26-19 win over the New Orleans Saints.\nEvans didn't record a catch, but it was nice to see him out on the field after an injury held him out of the season opener.\nThe numbers and catches will come in time for the second year receiver who is widely considered as one of the best young talents in the game at his position. The Buccaneers play next week in Houston against the 0-2 Texans.\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sportsphotos/status/645680600234479616", "http://t.co/mUwjoROtwP", "https://twitter.com/ESPNNFL/status/646077184482897920", "http://t.co/lSwiy3jdQ9", "https://twitter.com/RealMikeWilbon/status/645687250525798404", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "https://twitter.com/smartfootball/status/645687157017980928", "https://twitter.com/RKalland/status/645687309921353729", "https://twitter.com/aggiefblife/status/645764589771067392", "http://t.co/or7q8ePbjJ", "http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/tampa-bay-buccaneers-new-orleans-saints-mike-evans-092015", "https://twitter.com/richeisen/status/645687205764071424", "https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2"], "published": "2015-09-22T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:58:11.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
