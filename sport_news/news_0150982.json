In both divisions, teams projected to contend face strong challenges away from home.\nDefending MAC West Champion Northern Illinois (2-2, 0-0) travels to play at surprisingly tough Central Michigan (1-3, 0-0). The Chippewas do not have a winning record, but they do have a quality quarterback in Cooper Rush who has already shown his mettle against Michigan State and took Syracuse to the brink in overtime.\nA home upset to start conference play would make Central an immediate contender, particularly since the Chippewas also host the other heavy MAC West favorite, Toledo, later in the season.\nNorthern Illinois has not played well offensively in its last two games, but MAC stats show the Huskies are still averaging 30.5 points a game, compared to 20.2 for CMU, indicating an upset will not be easy.\nAs for Toledo (3-0, 0-0), the Rockets are the only undefeated MAC team. The offense has been less than stellar, but has been effective with transfer QB Phillip Ely at the controls. UT travels to play at Ball State (2-2, 1-0) on Saturday.\nToledo's defense has been stellar, allowing only three touchdowns in its first three games. Ball State is rebuilding, but seems to have struck gold with freshman quarterback Riley Neal, who has proven he can pass and run effectively.\nIn the MAC East, favorite Bowling Green (2-2, 0-0) is on the road at Buffalo (2-2, 0-0), where the Bulls are somewhat of a mystery, considering their two wins came over FCS Albany and a Florida Atlantic team that has just one win vs. FCS Charlotte.\nThe big showdown in the East Division has Ohio (3-1, 0-0) at surging Akron (2-2, 0-0), which has won its last two games, one impressively on the road, with a new quarterback in sophomore Tommy Woodson. The winner of this game promptly becomes the biggest challenger to dethrone BG as the East Division champion.\nHere is the Week 5 schedule for MAC teams:\nOhio at Akron, 2 p.m. ESPN3 - OU's Derrius Vick is the most efficient QB in the MAC to date. Florida International at UMass, 3 p.m. ESPN3 - UMass is the only winless team in the league. Northern Illinois at Central Michigan, 3 p.m. ESPN3 - Tough road opener for MAC West power. Toledo at Ball State, 3 p.m. ESPN3 - Rockets offense has to step up on the road. Bowling Green at Buffalo, 3:30 p.m. SportsChannel/ESPN3 - Nobody has stopped BG's offense yet. Miami at Kent State, 3:30 p.m. ESPN3 - Two teams looking to rise up in conference play. Eastern Michigan at No. 9 LSU, 7 p.m. ESPNU - Eagles have a tough chore on the road vs. SEC power", "external_links": ["http://www.mac-sports.com/custompages/stats/2015FB/confldrs.htm", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/531455/cooper-rush", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/515906/phillip-ely", "http://www.mac-sports.com/index.aspx?path=football&"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:52:54.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
