It’s all light-hearted and kind of amusing, until you remember why you’re looking in the first place. Or until you see it first hand.\nIn reality it is a desolate place, flanked by a collection of trailers and a ramshackle junkyard, where women pawn their bodies for as long as they can keep their smiles fresh and their assets taut. About a mile away is the Moonlite BunnyRanch, another brothel owned by Hof and featured in the HBO reality series Cathouse.\nOdom came here to party but this spot down an unmarked road off NV-160 is a world removed from the high-life of Hollywood or even the excess and neon of Las Vegas, just over 70 miles southeast of here.\nIt is remote, 30 minutes drive from the small town of Pahrump, which itself is 30 minutes from anywhere else. Remote enough that the men who stop by are coming for one reason only, and it’s not for the quaint little saloon bar down the street.\nNow is an inappropriate time to judge a hospital patient’s conduct or mindset, but the Love Ranch is not where a contented man whiles his time. It is a haven for lost souls in search of answers or anonymity and with at least $500 burning a hole in their pocket.\nOdom went through far more than that during a binge that included ingesting up to 10 sexual-performance enhancement pills and which began on Saturday afternoon and ended with a 911 call from the Love Ranch where workers found him unresponsive Tuesday at 3:15 p.m.\nApparently it takes a lot to shut down the Love Ranch, but it was closed for new customers on Wednesday. “We’re not taking any ‘line-ups’ today,” said a cheery representative over the phone, describing how a line of women parade for a customer to select his companion from. “But maybe tomorrow.”\nYet the establishment, a legal brothel with a license from the state of Nevada, had visitors of a different kind on Wednesday, with a smattering of news trucks and photographers waiting outside and even some inquisitive tourists who couldn’t resist a look at the now infamous scene.\n“I feel a bit guilty coming to see where it all went on, but we were a half hour away so we kind of had to come,” said Sally Francis, a 24-year-old from Albuquerque, N.M., heading to Sacramento with a group of friends. “We love the Kardashians and we are praying for Lamar. It is pretty sad that this is where it happened. We hope he pulls through.”\nJust under a mile away, Kathy Bragg, owner of the Miss Kathy’s Short Branch Saloon, was fielding calls from everywhere, from TMZ to her relatives across the country.\n“That’s the big difference, it just hasn’t stopped ringing all day,” Bragg said. “We’re sad that a young man is suffering. It’s usually a lot quieter round here.”\nOutside, a rare breeze flickered through to bring some temporary relief from the glaring Nevada scorch. It was enough to provoke a round of chatter from some resting bikers, perhaps the second most noteworthy thing to happen on a peculiar day in the middle of nowhere.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:29:59.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
