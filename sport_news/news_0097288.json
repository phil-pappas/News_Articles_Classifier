In a strange twist, the loss came against Philadelphia, the league's worst club. For the season, Arrieta led the NL in wins with 22 and ranked second in ERA at 1.77 and innings at 2.29. The Cubs were 25-8 in his starts.\nLHP Sam Freeman, Hebron, Rangers Freeman opened the season with Triple-A Round Rock. A month working with pitching coach Brad Holman helped Freeman harness his mid-90 mph fastball. Freeman returned to the majors in mid-May and gave the bullpen a power arm. He had 40 strikeouts in 38 1/3 innings and held opponents to a .218 average.\nOF-DH Evan Gattis, Bishop Lynch, Houston In his first American League season, Gattis set career-highs for homers with 27, RBIs with 88 and extra-base hits with 58. Gattis also had 11 triples, a hard-to-believe number for a player whose speed is below average. Gattis had one triple in 213 career games with Atlanta. Gattis had a .509 slugging percentage at Minute Maid Park and .415 on the road.\nLHP Clayton Kershaw, Highland Park, Los Angeles Dodgers Kershaw led the majors in strikeouts with 301 in 232 2/3 innings. He joined Hall of Fame left-hander Randy Johnson and right-hander Curt Schilling as the only pitchers in this century with a 300-strikeout season. Johnson did it twice. Kershaw went 11-1 with a 1.22 ERA in his last 17 starts. He had 17 walks and 161 strikeouts in 125 2/3 innings in that span.\nRHP Chris Martin, Arlington, New York Yankees Elbow tendinitis forced Martin onto the disabled list for most of May, and he needed time in the Triple-A International League to continue the recovery. Martin was 0-2 with one save and a 5.66 ERA in 24 relief appearances with the Yankees. He was used primarily when the Yankees trailed. The club was 9-15 when Martin pitched.\nRHP Bo Schultz, Highland Park, Toronto The picture of determination. Schultz has been cut once by his college team (Northwestern,) released by Oakland and pitched for Grand Prairie in the independent American Association. Schultz was set to graduate school when Arizona called, and he reached the majors with the Diamondbacks last year. Schultz, a power pitcher, allowed only 1.07 baserunners per innings in 31 relief appearances with the Jays.\nRHP Shawn Tolleson, Allen, Rangers Manager Jeff Banister started re-arranging the club on May 17. He removed the inconsistent Neftali Feliz as the closer and said there would be no roles in the bullpen. Banister tried Tolleson in save situations, and he converted his first 14 chances to earn the title of closer. Tolleson converted 35-of-37 chances for the fifth-best success rate (94.6 percent) among major-league closers.\nRHP Chris Young, Highland Park, Kansas City A 12-game winner with Seattle in 2014, Young went unsigned until Kansas City added him on March 7 with a deal that included a low base salary of $675,000. Young served as a valuable swing-man, with 18 starts and 16 relief appearances. He was 8-6 with a 3.18 ERA for 99 innings as a starter and 3-0 with a 2.59 ERA for 24 1/3 innings in relief. The Royals were 12-6 in his starts.\nRANGERS RETURN TO THE POSTSEASON Â\nThe Rangers are back in the postseason as the AL West Champs.\nThe Texas Rangers will play the No. 2 seed -- the Toronto Blue Jays Â -- in the playoffs.\nFULL PLAYOFF SCHEDULE HERE\nRangers' ALDS schedule set: Day games in Toronto, busy night in Arlington\nLatest news Grant: How the Rangers evolved, came back from nearly insurmountable deficits\nThe unsung heros: Nine small pieces that the Rangers needed to win the AL West\nSefko: Even the Mavericks are soaking in Rangers' success; Carlisle praises Banister\nGrant: 2015 Rangers are unique in so many ways\nRangers roster prediction for ALDS: Start the Martin Perez- Colby Lewis debate\nGosselin: A look at the quick keys to success for Rangers this postseason\nJon Daniels expects Keone Kela to be part of Rangers playoff bullpen\nRangers World Series odds among worst in playoff field\nRangers ticket update: What's still left for Games 3 and 4\nVideo: Emotional Jeff Banister appreciates Rangers' road to AL West title\nFootball town: More in Dallas watched 2 non-Cowboys NFL games than Rangers' AL West clincher\nWhere Astros beat Rangers: Houston, not Texas, has player in MLB's top 20 jersey sales\nRangers' Adrian Beltre earns AL Player of the Week honors: See his numbers\nRangers' Shin-Soo Choo is AL's top player for September; what stat he and Willie Mays share\n10 things Rangers fans need to know about the Toronto Blue Jays including their long wait to reach the postseason\nRangers GM Jon Daniels explains the 'really cool' moment he had with Josh Hamilton on Sunday\nUmpires announced for Rangers-Blue Jays ALDS\nFun Â\nBanned in Arlington: The Texas Rangers championship T-shirt you can't get at the stadium\nRangers' Derek Holland does great Arnold Schwarzenegger impression on SportsCenter Â\nThe backstory behind the Rangers' new 'Never Ever Quit' T-shirt Â\nGet to know the players Â 10 things to know about Rangers 3B Adrian Beltre: For your own good, stay away from his head\n10 things you might not know about the Rangers' Prince Fielder, including his four-hour workouts\n10 things you might not know about Derek Holland, including his top-notch impressions\n10 Texas Rangers you should know (or know better)\nHistoric look-back Â Where are they now?
