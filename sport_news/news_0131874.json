I’m not sure what the protocols are,” Laidlaw said. \n“I think you can see from the way he was taking his time – he was certainly having a look at the big screen and wasn’t sure himself. \n“And then he made a sharp exit at the end of the game, that’s for sure. I never got a chance to speak to him after the game, he was off that quick. \nHastings, again, was more direct. \n“That is the worst thing I have seen on a rugby field in a very long time. He is not prepared to face up to the players, that is not rugby and that is not the spirit of rugby,” Hastings said. \nA constant threat at halfback and also booting 19 points, Laidlaw questioned why the video referee hadn’t been used to adjudicate on the last-minute penalty – though rules dictate they can’t be called on for penalty decisions. \nShattered Scotland also lamented another second-half call when winger Sean Maitland was sin-binned for deliberately knocking the ball down. \nWith Maitland off the field, Australia crossed on his side of the field through Drew Mitchell, to take the lead in the see-sawing contest. \n“Looking at two decisions, all I would say – and you know Scotland are often the underdogs – is just saying ‘would the referee have made that decision against New Zealand?’,” asked former player and coach Sir Ian McGeechan. \n“And if the answers is yes, then you say ‘I’ll live with that’. \n“And sometimes I’m not always convinced.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:43:51.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
