They did what they had to do,” Bound Brook head coach Dominic Longo said. \nDual-threat junior quarterback and running back Rich Legrand ran 13 times for 24 yards as junior quarterback Spencer Spellman ran for 29 yards on nine carries for Pingry. 1 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1RAgnNk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:39:59.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
