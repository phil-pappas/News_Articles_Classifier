He was placed on desk duty after the encounter with Blake. \n“It is my understanding that these officers now face an administrative trial for their roles in the respective offences,” Blake said in a statement on Wednesday. “I have complete respect for the principle of due process and appreciate the efforts of the CCRB to advance this investigation.” \nA departmental trial could end in disciplinary action or termination.
