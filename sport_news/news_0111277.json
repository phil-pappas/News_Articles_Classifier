Tom Brady scrambled out of pressure and hit LeGarrette Blount for a touchdown, a play that highlighted both Brady's mobility and Blount's spacial awareness to get open on a scramble play. With the score, the Patriots extended their lead to 34-21 early in the fourth quarter before holding on to a 34-27 win.\nHere's how the play developed:\nHighlighted are Blount and the two middle linebackers that lose track of him bc of Brady scramble+Blount awareness pic.twitter.com/7GvwZbeBsk\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 Note receivers, how outside ones cross over to the middle, but especially the safety lining up on Edel/Gronk hash pic.twitter.com/ao9BCczBoB\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 Brady looks that way first to draw the safety's eyes there first, but the play looks designed to go to Keshawn Martin.\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 It appears Brady has Martin open here and could have made the throw. The safety is not in position to make a play. pic.twitter.com/8vhpiUEOG4\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 Brady, however, feels pressure, and Blount, seeing no blitz from the inside linebackers, sits down as a safety valve.\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 Brady's scramble causes one backer to break toward Brady, and Blount alertly sees it. So does the LB behind Blount. pic.twitter.com/8wfrIsYYhE\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 This is where Brady and Blount's chemistry on the fly does wonders. Blount, as noted by others before, worked a lot pic.twitter.com/5ah14aCrCY\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 ... on improving his pass catching ability this offseason. Saw a lot of it in the Carolina preseason game but really all over the place.\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 Has become so much more of a complete back. Maybe he was always this way, who knows? We're seeing it come out more now, though.\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 This is the result of Blount's \"spacial awareness,\" moving into a wide open area. The rest is pitch and catch. pic.twitter.com/bs58GYwRoZ\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015 Blount makes the catch and barrels in. Easy call for Edelman. pic.twitter.com/ILq9KGOIiS\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 20, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656345750796914688", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656345133135343616", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656344586181320704", "https://t.co/ILq9KGOIiS", "https://t.co/ao9BCczBoB", "https://t.co/bs58GYwRoZ", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656346634629095424", "https://t.co/5ah14aCrCY", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656344324570005504", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656346385659371520", "https://t.co/7GvwZbeBsk", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656348254821556224", "https://t.co/8wfrIsYYhE", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656347138725646336", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656344924946829312", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656343098268717056", "https://twitter.com/AdamKurkjian/status/656346821095215104", "https://t.co/8vhpiUEOG4"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:12:45.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
