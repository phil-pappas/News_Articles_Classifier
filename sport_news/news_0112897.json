Or, look farther afield, to Cuba, the Cook Islands, or India, because they were there too, describing new ways and reasons to travel to those exotic destinations.\nAn Oregonian Media Group event, the show was well attended is already considering an encore performance next year, though a date has not been set.\nFollowing are notes from one reporter's notebook after talking with travel representatives who worked the show.\nCook Islands stopover\nInstead of \"why\" the Cook Islands, the question should be \"why not.\"\nAt least for anyone traveling from the American West Coast to a New Zealand vacation, it makes a lot of sense to add the Cook Islands to an itinerary. That was the message carried to Portland last weekend by Cook Islands Travel North America .\nFirst off, it helps to know where the Cook Islands are located. The inference is that they are named for British Capt. James Cook, which means they are in the Pacific Ocean, which Cook famously explored three times in the late 18th century. But where in that vast expanse?\nLet's just say if you fly from Los Angeles, a West Coast gateway to New Zealand, to Auckland, the biggest city in the island nation, you'll pass just about directly over the island of Rarotonga, largest in the Cooks.\nMay as well ask the captain to set down the Air New Zealand jet for a look around, right? One day a week, the airline does just that, adding a stop to and from the Cooks on that flight between New Zealand and California. The stopover comes at no extra charge by the airline, the Cook Islands let you enter with just a passport and those islands are fabulously beautiful.\nThe islands have more frequent Air New Zealand service from the Cook Islands southward to Auckland and Sydney.\nThe main islands are surrounded each by their own atoll, which colors the near shore waters turquoise and keeps the sharks from nibbling on tourists' toes. It's classic South Pacific island beauty, located due south of Hawaii's Kauai Island, about as far south of the equator as Hawaii is north, and on the western side of the International Date Line. Tahiti is to the east and Samoa to the west of the Cooks, while New Zealand is another four-plus hours of flying to the southwest.\nThe Cook Islands can be the idyllic stopover. They are said to be like Hawaii was in the 1930s, lightly populated, friendly, English speaking, not too expensive and no hotels taller than a palm tree. Only about 7,500 North Americans visit each year. Peak Travel Group of Portland was at the travel show to assist travel planning to the Cook Islands.\nHere and There Travel Fest 2015 Music and scenes from the 2015 Here and There Travel Fest at the Oregon Convention Center, an Oregonian Media Group event, Oct. 10-11.\nSage Center and shareoregon.com\nTourism destinations that have a lot to offer but lack name recognition have a new way of getting the word out.\nThe Sage Center in Boardman, a $7 million visitor center in northeast Oregon, had a booth at the travel fest, which attracted the attention of Rick Reynolds, founder of a new Portland-based website called shareoregon.com .\nThe website is designed to let places and people with things to see and do post the information on the searchable site. The new website is just beginning to develop a data package, but it shows promise for being a big help in the future.\nUse is free, for listing and browsing, though that could change in the future due to the cost of maintaining the website.\nThe site encourages users to post tours, events, experts' advice, education opportunities, meals/food/drink, stays, vacation rentals, arts/crafts and more.\nIn the case of the Sage Center, the facility is a Port of Morrow project dedicated to teaching visitors about the local agricultural economy, everything from growing to processing and transporting.\nBoardman is a small town and it's hard to get the word out, even though the Sage Center catches the eye of travelers on Interstate 84. Trouble is, eastbound travelers have already missed the best exit by a mile when they notice the impressive complex just north of the freeway.\nTo plan to visit the Sage Center, take exit 164 at Boardman and drive one mile east on Front Street just north of the freeways. Holidays excepting, the center is open this time of year from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Adult admission is $5, or $3 for students and seniors.\nNew flight opens door to India\nThe land of tigers, elephants and mysticism is reaching out to travelers from Oregon and, debuting in December, will have a new way to get there.\nIndia, the world's largest democracy, is inviting Oregonians to drop by for a visit. It will soon become easier to get there, when Air India starts nonstop San Francisco-to-New Delhi service on Dec. 2, if you can call 16 hours of flying time covering 7,670 miles \"easy.\"\nA Boeing 777-200 LR will fly the route three times a week initially. This will be the only direct Pacific Ocean flight between North America and India. Previously, Air India flew Los Angeles to Frankfurt (Germany) and on to Mumbai, but that flight was discontinued.\nRepresentatives from India Tourism's Los Angeles office look at Oregon as a \"good market,'' according to show representative Sandhya Haridas, who comes from the far south of India but works in Los Angeles. She said Air India is part of Star Alliance, which makes getting between San Francisco and Portland easy on code-share partner United Airlines.\nShe also noted that India uses an eTourist Visa system, similar to the electronic travel authorization used by Australia, where U.S. passport holders can apply and pay online conveniently in the days before their trip. Can it get any easier to see the Taj Mahal?\nPretty much every traveler knows something about the sub-continent and has a good idea of whether they would like to see India or not. India Tourism is working to get the word out about how easy India is to visit and lets the magic of the place take over from there.\nIndia Tourism was joined at the Portland show by California-based Sita Word Tours , which Haridas said is one of the best North American tour operators to the land of the tiger.\nKen Kesey mural in Springfield\nSpringfield has a new Ken Kesey mural, according to Samara Phelps who represents Travel Lane County's Eugene Cascades & Coast , making it quite a mural town.\nJust a year before, the city welcomed a big mural of \"The Simpsons\" TV show to celebrate the inspiration that Springfield gave to show creator Matt Groening.\nThe latest mural subject wrote \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and was nearly as well known locally as the Simpsons are in theirs. Those two murals make quite a statement for Springfield.\nSo does Springfield's inclusion in the Eugene Ale Trail , another tourism talking point for Lane County. Plank Town Brewing Co. in downtown Springfield at 346 Main St. is in the building where the Kesey mural is featured outside.\nPlank Town Brewing opened in May 2013 and has become a downtown institution. It's one of 17 brew houses on the Eugene Ale Trail, which also includes members in Oakridge and Cottage Grove. Pick up an ale trail passport, get stamps for visiting eight locations and redeem it for a 32-ounce mini growler at the Eugene Cascades & Coast Adventure Center , 3312 Gateway St., Springfield.\nCuba opens to American travelers\nThe U.S. government has eased travel restrictions to Cuba, but it's still a complicated process, should you wish to travel legally to the island just south of Florida.\nThere are flights from Toronto or Cancun, Mexico, to Havana, but Cuba travel expert Ronen Paldi advises caution when considering those. Go legally, was the message he carried to the travel show.\nPaldi has been to Cuba 28 times since his first trip in 2000 and specializes in travel to Cuba with his travel agency, Ya'lla Tours USA , at 4711 S.W. Huber St., Suite 1, Portland.\nAir travel options have expanded greatly to Cuba, with flights now from Miami, Tampa, Orlando, New York and more. Los Angeles will soon have a once-a-week charter to Havana, a flight Paldi likes to book because it does not require an overnight coming and going in the gateway city, for Cuba travel from Portland.\nGetting to Cuba is easy, but booking a hotel that meets international standards is not. \"And Beyonce and her husband will already be staying in the suite at the Saratoga Hotel,'' said Paldi, drawing laughter from his well-attended seminar on Cuba at the show.\nPaldi says his agency can design Cuban travel packages for a variety of needs, though small group escorted tours are the primary way Americans travel in Cuba. Of a dozen travel options allowed by the U.S. State Department, the guise of \"humanitarian\" travel is easiest for him to arrange. Such trips usually include a donation to a religious institution in Cuba.\nCuban travel is not cheap: $5,495 per person, double occupancy for one week, plus airfare. It is also not easy to book, and Ya'lla Tours is filled through its May departure.\n\"It's supply and demand,'' Paldi said. \"There is way more demand than there is supply, especially for hotel rooms.\"\nAnd no, he said, despite what officials at the the highest level of U.S. government say, you cannot use a credit card in Cuba. \"That won't happen until an American bank signs an agreement with a Cuban bank,\" Paldi said.\nFly away at Portland airport\nThe Port of Portland had representatives at the show to update air travelers of changes coming to Portland International Airport.\nThe big change on the way is a rebuilding of Terminal E and shuffling of flight locations for Alaska and United Airlines. Construction has commenced and will continue through late 2017.\nOther upgrades at the airport, either ongoing or taking place in the near future, include new carpeting throughout, more new shops and restaurants, a remodel of the federal inspection station for international arrivals and security checkpoint upgrades.\nPDX has also enhanced air service in the past 12 months, after being chosen three years in a row as best in the country by readers of Travel + Leisure magazine.\nTwo new airlines serving Europe with nonstop flights will increase seasonal service next year from two flights a week to three weekly flights: Condor Airlines to Frankfort, Germany, and Icelandair to Reykjavik. Delta Airlines continues transoceanic service to Amsterdam and Tokyo from PDX.\nAnother new international route with nonstop service is Guadalajara, Mexico, served by Volaris Airlines. A search of the Volaris timetable shows that it flies three times a week.\nOther service upgrades in the past year have been Alaska Airlines with flights to Minneapolis-St. Paul, Omaha, Kansas City, St. Louis and Austin, Texas; Southwest Airlines to Los Angeles International Airport, Orange County and to its hub at Love Field in Dallas and PenAir to Crescent City, Calif., with Klamath Falls coming.\nJet Blue has added seasonal service to Anchorage, Alaska, and Delta Airlines is back in the Honolulu market with seasonal service.\nImmunizations safeguard travel\nPassport, visa, air ticket, time away . . . planning travel gets complicated.\nOne more complication: don't forget the immunizations you need, especially for travel in the tropics, or just general preventive medicine for active time on the go away from home.\nThe obvious place to start is with your primary care physician and clinic, but it can quickly get more complicated than that. So that's where the Travel and Immunization Clinic of Portland enters the fray.\nThat was came from clinic manager Linda Boring, who says the clinic is very specialized in what it does and is there to help travelers who need that special attention.\nThe clinic staff is trained to determine what pre-trip to post-trip care travelers need, depending on destination, medical and other personal history. According to Boring, primary care providers often don't even attempt to keep up with vaccinations for hepatitis, cholera or diphtheria, let alone prevention for less common but still serious illnesses that lurk on the road.\nThe clinic follows weekly changes in recommended medications for world travelers, as made by government and health agencies. \"Most primary care clinics just can't keep up with that kind of detail,'' said Boring, who takes her name from the family that gave its name to a town in Clackamas County.\nWhen travel requires special medical planning, Boring advises beginning the process four to six weeks before departure. But not everyone does that.\n\"We had one patient show up for a 10:10 a.m. appointment and told us he had to be at the airport at 12:45 p.m. the same day. We did the best we could,'' she said.\nThe clinic, founded in 2003, is at 2330 N.W. Flanders St., No. 103, Portland; 503-227-7771; travelhealthnw.com .\nSmall Planet Travel Cards\nYou don't have to be traveling to Las Vegas to use the new Small Planet Travel Cards. In fact, these cards won't help you win at blackjack, but they could help you make friends in Madagascar.\nOr in 50 other foreign destinations.\nThe cards are the brainchild of Mark Zanmiller of Hood River, who debuted them at the travel show. The cards piqued so many show-goers' curiosity that his booth often was swarmed by more visitors than the one next door. And that one was giving away free samples of Tito's Handmade Vodka from Austin, Texas.\nThe cards are the size of business cards, but they carry so much more information.\nThe card for Madagascar has a photo of baobab trees, its flag, size and population, currency, emergency phone numbers, tipping suggestions and 12 common phrases that can help a traveler connect with a local.\nThe country card comes packaged with four others on metric conversions, pronunciation guide, a notes card and an intro card, for $2.50. The cards can be custom packaged or designed to support agency or corporate travel.\n\"The cards start a cultural bridge and are a wonderful ice breaker,'' Zanmiller said. \"They are much easier to have ready to use at hand than a phrase book. They can make the difference between night and day in how you get treated.''\nCards are available for 50 countries, with more coming, after Zanmiller does the research.\nThe cards are available through smallplanetcards.com.\nGet pre-checked by TSA\nThe Transportation Security Administration brought a welcome message to the show: You no long need to take off your shoes when you go through airport security, provided you have TSA pre-check.\nThe program began four years ago, then was fully implemented in January 2014. The luck of the draw, where an airline could get a passenger pre-approved, has ended, so travelers need to take it upon themselves to initiate the process.\nAbout 1.5 million Americans have done so, according to Nico Melendez, TSA regional public affairs manager.\nWhy set up pre-check? It can save frequent travelers time and hassle.\nThe larger U.S. airports have special security lines for passengers who have pre-check noted on their boarding passes. The lines are shorter and move more quickly because pre-approved passengers do not need to take off shoes, remove laptops from cases, place small amounts of liquids in trays, or take off belts or outer clothing.\nTo qualify for pre-check, air travelers must pre-enroll on the TSA website, provide basic information and proof of U.S. citizenship. They will be finger printed and undergo a background check. If they pass, they must pay $85 to be in pre-check for five years.\nIt's also possible to qualify for pre-check by going through one of three traveler verification programs runs by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Most attractive of the three to Oregonians, who don't have an international border to contend with on a regular basis, is \"global entry,\" which for $100 will give those pre-approved expedited customs clearance, as well as TSA pre-check.\nBe sure to submit your pre-check number when purchasing an air ticket. Apply for pre-check at tsa.gov , or global entry at cbp.gov .\nGetting around Astoria in style\nThe Astoria Column isn't the only spruced-up offering at the mouth of the Columbia River.\nVisit Astoria, oldest American settlement in the West, and you can see, or perhaps take a ride in, the Astoria Clown Car or the Glam Tram. Can a return of the Astoria ferry be far behind?\nFirst off, the signature city's Astoria Column looks better than ever after a refurbishment to the tune of $1 million. The column reopened last weekend after phase I of the project, while phase II continues. There will be celebration events in town Oct. 23-25, but a grand celebration will be planned next year upon completion of phase 2. Refer to the column website, astoriacolumn.org , for details.\nDonna Quinn, director of sales and marketing for Astoria's Cannery Pier Hotel, offered an update on all-things Astoria. She said Jeff Daly is creating fun things to do for visitors after he moved back a bit ago. His father was one of the original Astoria Clowns , so Jeff decided to revive the tradition with the original Astoria Clown Car, which he found rusting in a field in Shaniko in north-central Oregon. He got the car back on the road and uses it for special occasions, Quinn said.\nDaly also operates the Glam Tram, which was a people mover at the Los Angeles Zoo in the 1960s. It has a rocking stereo with on-board fireplace and holds 20 for birthday parties, pub crawls or toga parties.\nCannery Pier Hotel owner Robert \"Jake\" Jacob has purchased a 1978 Leyland Olympian 77-passenger red British double decker bus that is awaiting parts from England and may soon be in service, according to Quinn.\nAlso, Jacob is making plans for the return of the Tourist 2, Astoria's last operating ferry, according to Quinn. The 1924 three-deck wooden-hulled ferry is 110 feet long, 40 feet wide, 40 feet tall and holds 185 people. The ferry is owned by Christian Lint, tugboat captain of over 60 years, who has it in Bremerton, Wash. He is amenable to having it returned to Astoria, where it shuttled passengers across the Columbia River from 1924 to 1966.\nIt could be used as a riverfront tour boat, perhaps by next year. More information is at astoriaferry.com .\nSomething else of note: humpback whales have been spotted in the mouth of the Columbia River recently, perhaps swimming up river to see what's new in Astoria.\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": ["http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/", "http://www.airnewzealand.com/best-price-to-the-cook-islands", "http://www.visitsage.com/", "http://www.sitatours.com/", "http://blog.sfgate.com/cmcginnis/2015/09/29/air-india-confirms-sfo-delhi-flights/"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:19:34.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
