Makudi, the president of the football association in Thailand, can appeal the ban. \nMakudi was a member of the FIFA executive committee (known as the \"Ex-co\") that voted controversially in December 2010 to award host nation status for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments to Russia and Qatar, respectively. After the vote, Makudi was accused of soliciting bribes from English soccer executives while they campaigned to have England host the 2018 World Cup. Specifically, former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman testified that Makudi had sought television rights for a friendly match between England and Thailand. \nOf the 22 Ex-co members eligible in that 2010 vote, at least six have since been indicted on criminal charges or suspended by FIFA, or both. At least another three are unnamed co-conspirators in the 47-count indictment handed up by a Brooklyn grand jury in the federal racketeering case based in the Eastern District of New York. \nOn Sept. 25, Swiss authorities interrogated Blatter at FIFA headquarters, searched his office, and issued a news release saying the 79-year-old Swiss was suspected of \"criminal mismanagement\" of FIFA finances. Blatter has denied all misconduct and has appealed his 90-day ban that started on Oct. 8.
