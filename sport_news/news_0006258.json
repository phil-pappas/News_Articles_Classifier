The 44-year-old aced the par-three 17th and sandwiched that with birdies on 16 and 18. \nHe is joined on 10 under by Canadian Nick Taylor and American duo Jason Bohn and Cameron Tringale to leave the top nine players separated by just three shots ahead of day four in Las Vegas. \nRickie Fowler failed to sustain his second-round charge up the leaderboard as his one-under 70 left him seven shots behind Stegmaier. \nEngland's Greg Owen, who was a shot off the lead after day one, followed each of his three bogeys with a birdie on the next hole for a level-par 71 that leaves him 10 strokes off the pace. \nMartin Laird is a shot better off after a 70 while fellow Scot Russell Knox is two strokes back on two under.
