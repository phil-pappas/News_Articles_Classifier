Tim Bezbatchenko is Toronto's current GM.\nManning, who won the MLS's top executive award in 2012 and 2014, left his job as president of Real Salt Lake and Rio Tinto Stadium in August after eight years with the club. At the time, RSL said it was revamping its management structure.\nUnder Manning, Real Salt Lake won the 2009 MLS Cup and was runner-up in 2013. The club also thrived off the field.\n\"TFC has made important strides this season, as the club pushes for its first-ever playoff berth in a premier, newly renovated stadium, in front of some of the very best supporters in the league,\" Manning said in a statement. \"I look forward to working with Tim Bezbatchenko, Greg Vanney and the TFC staff at this exciting time and I am grateful to Mr. Tanenbaum and the MLSE ownership for this opportunity to come to a world-class city, and club, to help make its championship vision a reality.\"\nRSL is struggling this year, standing ninth in the Western Conference with an 11-12-8 record. Toronto, on the verge of its first ever playoff berth, is 14-13-4 and fifth in the more benign Eastern Conference.\nA native of Massapequa, N.Y., Manning was an all-American soccer player at the University of Bridgeport. After college, he won a U.S. Open Cup with the Brooklyn Italians in 1991, and played professionally in the United Soccer League .\nHe also holds a U.S. Soccer National \"A\" Coaching Licence.\nManning began his career in sports management with the Continental Indoor Soccer League during its inaugural season in 1993. He subsequently moved on to the United Soccer League with the Long Island Rough Riders and then the Minnesota Thunder where he was named USL Executive of the Year in 1999.\nHe started in MLS in 2000 as president and GM of the Tampa Bay Mutiny.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:21:04.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
