Arrowhead, which is going for its fourth straight trip to the final, is a surprising No. 3 seed, but it should get a chance to prove its naysayers wrong as soon as next week when it will likely play at No. 2 Middleton, the Big 8 champion.\nSHOWTIME : Much of the excitement for Milwaukee King's football team has been for this moment. Can the City champion make a playoff run? They should get past Washington this week, which would set up a second-round game with Marquette at Custer Stadium. That would be an intriguing matchup for sure.\nREBOOT: The top four teams in the North Shore Conference and the two squads from the Greater Metro find themselves in the same portion of the Division 2 bracket. It has created a couple of rematch opportunities in the early rounds that will test the group's top seeds. On Friday, Homestead, the No. 2 seed plays host to Germantown, a team it lost to, 34-29, in Week. 4, and next week No. 1 seed Brookfield Central will face either Brookfield East, a team it beat, 21-14, in Week 5, or get another crack at Whitefish Bay, which it lost to, 35-14, in the season opener.\nSHARP SABERS: Franklin has plenty of bite. The Sabers have run through their schedule, winning their games by an average of 32.6 points, while trailing only one opponent this season. They should take care of Bradley Tech on Friday and then defeat whichever team comes out of the Racine Horlick-Kenosha Indian Trail Level 1 game — Franklin shut out both teams. That would set up a monster matchup with Muskego in the state quarterfinals.\nREBOUND: Waterford just missed an undefeated season, falling to Badger last week on a late fourth-quarter touchdown. The Wolverines have won four straight Southern Lakes titles and the previous three seasons Waukesha West knocked them out of the playoffs. If both teams win, Waterford will have a chance to change its luck in the Division 2 quarterfinals.\nAREA TEAMS DIVISION 1 Arrowhead (8-1): The Warhawks won their fourth straight Classic 8 title. Now the team, state champs in 2012 and '13, is chasing its fourth straight championship game appearance.\nFranklin (9-0): The Sabers won their third straight Southeast Conference title and finished the regular season as the area's top-ranked team.\nKenosha Indian Trail (5-4): Last week s ophomore Jared Weinberg had his best start since taking over for the injured senior Ian Chatman in Week 6, throwing for 215 yards and two touchdowns in a 48-23 victory over Oak Creek.\nMarquette (6-3): Senior Jack Dwyer is completing 66.9% of his passes and ranks third in the area with 2,086 passing yards for the Hilltoppers, who finished third in the Greater Metro.\nMilwaukee Bradley Tech (4-5): Junior Bakari Rieves and senior Deangelo Benford are the leading rushers for the Trojans, who enter the postseason with a three-game losing streak.\nMilwaukee Hamilton (7-2): The Wildcats, who won their first conference title since 1982, enter the postseason with shutouts in their final two games.\nMilwaukee King (9-0): The Generals have a 29-game City Conference winning streak and enter the playoffs undefeated for the second straight season.\nMilwaukee Morse-Marshall (6-3): Sophomore Kordell Ellis finished the season strong, averaging 138 rushing yards per game during the team's six-game winning streak.\nMilwaukee Riverside (5-4): Senior Gerry Gray leads the Tigers in rushing (743 yards, 10.3 yards per carry) and receiving (17, 21.6 yards per catch).\nMilwaukee Vincent (4-5): Senior Jaylan Nelson rushed for 250 yards in the final two games, must-win situations for the Vikings to reach the postseason for the first time since 2012.\nMilwaukee Washington (5-4): The Purgolders finished third in the Blackbourn Division behind King and Marshall but beat Richardson Division champion Hamilton, 28-6, in a non-conference game.\nMuskego (8-1): The 1-2-3 punch of seniors Brett Finke, Ayden Malcomson and Colin O'Neill has been devastating for the Warriors, whose only loss was a 28-21 setback to Waukesha West in Week 3.\nOak Creek (7-2): Junior Jakup Sinani has completed 58.1% of his passes for 1,370 yards for the Knights, whose losses came to Franklin and Kenosha Indian Trail.\nOconomowoc (9-0): Junior Ben Nienhuis has passed for 2,358 yards, the third-best total in the state, to help the team win its second Wisconsin Little Ten title in three years.\nRacine Horlick

Dominic Labellarte produced his second straight 1,000-yard rushing season to lead the Lancers to their first Greater Metro title since 2011.\nBrookfield East (8-1): The Spartans, whose only loss came, 21-14, to Brookfield Central in Week 5, posted four shutouts and allowed an average of 9.9 points per game.\nCedarburg (7-2): The Bulldogs, whose losses came to North Shore co-champions Homestead and Whitefish Bay, entered the final game with a chance to win a piece of the crown.\nGermantown (6-3): The Warhawks played Catholic Memorial tough and defeated Homestead before consecutive losses to Whitefish Bay and Cedarburg knocked them out of the North Shore race.\nHomestead (7-2): The Highlanders won their 15th straight North Shore title by defeating the league's top two contenders, Whitefish Bay and Cedarburg, in the final two weeks.\nGreendale (6-3): A large senior class led the Panthers to their third straight Woodland West division title though sophomore Mitchell Gnadt led the team in rushing and passing.\nGreenfield (7-2): Despite an ankle injury to big-play back Ezekiel Banks, the Hawks, conference champions for the first time since 1978, beat Greendale in the Woodland Championship game last week.\nMilwaukee Bay View (6-3): Sophomores Giontae Brooks (1,513) and Isiah Wright (1,209) had 1,000-yard rushing seasons for the Wildcats, who are back in the playoffs for the first time since 2010.\nSlinger (8-1): Senior running back/linebacker Tyler Reinhardt ranks second on the team in rushing (564 yards) and tackles (69) for the Owls, whose only loss came, 28-14, to undefeated Oconomowoc.\nUnion Grove (6-3): Junior Matt Nelson is completing 62.7% of his passes for 1,583 yards for the Broncos, who are back in the playoffs for the first time since 2009.\nWaterford (8-1): Senior David Bansemer and sophomore Ben Michalowski are the top two tackles on a defense that posted two shutouts and held six teams to 14 points or fewer.\nWatertown (5-4): Senior quarterback Zeke Yaeggi has two 300-yard passing games for the Goslings, who entered the final week of the season with a chance to tie for the Wisconsin Little Ten title.\nWaukesha West (7-2): The Wolverines' biggest victory came over Muskego, 28-21 in Week 3, but losses to Arrowhead, 35-7, and Catholic Memorial, 34-20, dropped them out of the Classic 8 race.\nWauwatosa West (7-2): Seniors Kobe Vines and Truman Tyson and junior Paris Howell all have more than 600 rushing yards for the Trojans, whose losses came to New Berlin Eisenhower and Greendale by an average of five points.\nWhitefish Bay (7-2): Senior Macklin Kortebein is the leading rusher (967 yards) and receiver (24 catches, 406 yards) for the Blue Dukes, who won their first league title since 2012.\nWilmot (7-2): All that separates the Panthers from an undefeated season were seven-points losses to Waterford and Delavan-Darien.\nDIVISION 3 Delavan-Darien (5-4): The Comets are one of six teams with sub .500 conference records in the field.\nKewaskum (9-0): Senior Brandon Thull is about 200 yards rushing away from 5,000 for his career for the Indians, who won their first league title since 2001.\nCatholic Memorial (7-2): Sophomore linebacker C.J. Goetz is the leading tackler for a defense that has posted four shutouts and allowed 12.4 points per game against Classic 8 competition.\nCudahy (4-5): The Packers are back in the playoffs for the first time since 2011 thanks, in part, to the play of junior Rusty Miller, who has completed 53.6% of his passes for 1,136 yards while ranking second on the team with 332 yards rushing.\nNew Berlin Eisenhower (8-1): All that separates the Lions, who feature multitalented senior Jordan Canady, from an undefeated season is a 34-14 loss to Greendale in Week 3.\nPewaukee (5-4): The Pirates needed a Week 9 victory over Messmer/Shorewood to make their 11th straight playoff appearance.\nSt. Francis (8-1): Senior running back Evander Craft has a state-best 2,043 rushing yards for the Mariners, who with 561 students are the smallest school in the division.\nWhitnall (5-4): The Woodland East Division co-champion is a victory from their most successful season since 2009 when University of Wisconsin quarterback Joel Stave quarterbacked the team.\nWisconsin Lutheran (5-4): Track star Josh Kren, a senior running back, is having a big season for the Vikings with 1,179 rushing yards in 153 carries.\nDIVISION 4 East Troy (6-3): The Trojans, who have won six straight games, are led by senior Nick Ruffalo, who ranks fourth in the area with 2,065 passing yards.\nDIVISION 5 University School (5-4): The Wildcats, who finished fourth in the Midwest Classic, suffered two of their three league by a touchdown or less.\nShoreland Lutheran (7-2): The Pacers have gone from one victory in 2013 to six in 2014 to seven so far this season.\nBrookfield Academy (7-2): Junior quarterback Ian Francis has completed 66.5% of his passes for 1,772 yards and 27 touchdowns for the Knights.\nRacine St. Catherine's (5-4): After a streak of four conference titles, the Angels dipped to fourth in the Metro Classic\nKenosha St. Joseph (6-3): The Lancers were in the Metro Classic title hunt until the final game, which they lost, 48-26, to undefeated Catholic Central.\nDIVISION 6 Lake Country Lutheran (8-1): The Lightning, whose only loss came to Catholic Central, 21-7, in non-conference play are 42-4 in the past seven seasons.\nOzaukee (7-2): The Warriors finished second in the Big East to Hilbert, a team they did not face this season.\nDIVISION 7 Catholic Central (9-0): Senior Cole Kresken leads the Hilltoppers, conference champions for the first time since 2010, in rushing (1,276 yards, 9.2 average per carry) and tackles (87).\nMark Stewart\nSCHEDULE FIRST ROUND Games at 7 p.m. Friday unless noted\n(Seedings listed in parenthesis)\nLevel 1 pairings\nDIVISION 1\nGroup A\n(8) Green Bay Preble at (1) Kimberly\n(5) D.C.
