Harrison stunned Greenbrier, knocking the Panthers back in the pack in 5A-West. Vilonia kept its playoff hopes alive with a narrow victory over Farmington. As expected, Conway Christian had no problem in romping past winless Cutter Morning Star. Mayflower lost by one point to Atkins. CONWAY 28, LR CATHOLIC 10 \nAt War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock, the Conway defense turned in its best effort of the season and got offensive support from Mark Odom in a 28-10 victory. The Wampus Cats (4-4, 3-2) clinched a home berth in the first round of the playoffs and will play Bryant in two weeks for the 7A portion of the Central Conference and more home berths. Odom, who rushed for 145 yards on 12 carries, got the Cats going with a 60-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. Matthew Dail’s 2-yard run after a long kickoff return by Marquis Pleasant gave the Cats a 14-3 lead at the half. Breylin Smith connected with Devonte Allen in the third quarter. Allen took the ball away from a Catholic defender for a 74-yard touchdown. Will Kennedy’s 45-yard interception return for a touchdown gave Conway a 28-3 lead in the fourth quarter before the Rockets tacked on a late score on a 1-yard run by quarterback Andre Sale. The Conway defense, which never allowed the Rockets any consistency, held them to 102 yards rushing. HARRISON 38, GREENBRIER 0 \nAt Don Jones Stadium at Greenbrier, the Panthers were pounded by Goblins in a game that possibly knocked them out of 5A-West title contention and put their backs to the wall for a playoff berth in the jumbled conference race behind Little Rock Christian. Harrison (4-4, 3-2) built a 21-point lead in the first quarter and were never challenged in the 38-0 mercy-rule victory. The victory gave the Goblins the tiebreaker over Greenbrier as far as making the postseason and/or possible seeding. VILONIA 22, FARMINGTON 20 \nAt Phillip Weaver Stadium, the Eagles (4-4, 2-3) kept their postseason hopes alive and broke a three-game losing streak in the 22-20 victory over the Cardinals (3-4, 1-3)Blaine Norman intercepted two passes in the second half for Vilonia, including one in the end zone in the fourth quarter. The Eagle defense stopped a two-point conversion attempt by the Cardinals in the third quarter that was decisive. Vilonia had 429 yards of offense and quarterback Luke Gordon rushed for 110 yards. ATKINS 35, MAYFLOWER 34 \nAt Atkins, the Red Devils built a 21-14 lead and held off a Mayflower comeback attempt in a 35-34 victory that virtually eliminated the Eagles’ 2-3A title hopes. Atkins upped its record to 4-4 and 2-3. Mayflower is 3-5, 3-2. CONWAY CHRISTIAN 54, CUTTER MORNING STAR 8 \nAt Mission Field, Conway Christian scored early and often in the 54-8 victory over Cutter Morning Star that kept the Eagles a game out of the lead in 2A-5. CCS (5-3, 4-1) scored 27 points in the first quarter and led the visiting Eagles (0-8, 0-5), 41-0, at the half with the entire second half being played under the mercy rule. Cutter has been outscored 233-44 in conference games. The Eagles amassed 473 yards of offense to 264 for the visiting Eagles, who had only 40 yards rushing. Quarterback Jakob Henry completed 12 of 18 passes for 362 yards. Seth Smith caught three of those passes for 142 yards. Jon Mark Wood caught three for 109 yards. Henry passed 6 and 42 yards to Wood and 84 26 yards to Smith for four touchdowns in the first quarter. He hit Clayton Dent for TD passes of 16 and 84 yards in the third quarter. He passed 32 yards to Smith for another score in the third quarter. CCS capped the scoring with a 16-yard run by Brendan Camp. Winston Strawn had eight tackles for CCS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:04:13.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
