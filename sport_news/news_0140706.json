The party insiders said all senior leaders of the party’s state units, including Cabinet Ministers, have been camping in Leh and campaigning in favour of their candidates. The BJP has fielded its candidates on 25 out of the total 26 constituencies of the Council, while its arch-rival Congress, too, has fielded the equal number of candidates. In the outgoing Council, the Congress had 21 seats, while the BJP had just four seats. The BJP had been emboldened by its first-ever victory from Ladakh Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 Parliamentary elections but it had to suffer a major setback in the Assembly elections held in November-December last year when it failed to open its account in the cold desert, losing both the seats of Leh district to the Congress. “The Cabinet Ministers and their juniors in the Council of Ministers in the ruling PDP-BJP government have been campaigning for these polls. Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh is arriving in Leh tomorrow for poll campaign and we are confident of winning the elections and forming the Council at our own this time,” said Munish Sharma, general secretary of the BJP and election co-in charge Leh, who was camping in Leh for the past one month. He said the people have shown faith in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and after the formation of the BJP government in the state, they want to bring change in the Leh Council. “We will win these polls and form our own Council,” Sharma said. State BJP president Jugal Kishore Sharma, who had also been camping for the party candidates in Leh, claimed that his party was going to write a new chapter in the LAHDC elections. “Our party will ensure that the sufferings of the people are mitigated and an era of development and welfare starts in each and every area,” he said. On the other side, the Congress is solely depending on veteran Buddhist leader and former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora to counter the saffron party’s aggressive campaign. Jora, a three-time MLA from Leh, is leading the Congress campaign in the mountainous region from the front and no other senior Congress leader has so far visited Leh to campaign in favour of their party candidates. In its poll campaign, the Congress said the BJP would draw blank in its kitty at the end of the elections as they made hollow promises with the people of Ladakh in the last Parliamentary elections while its state leadership failed to honour the interests of Ladakhi people. The BJP has also some reason to worry because its ally in the ruling state government, the PDP, has decided not to contest the Leh Council poll jointly with the Saffron party. The PDP has fielded its candidates on eight seats and its candidates would give fight to the BJP candidates in at least six constituencies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:22:28.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
