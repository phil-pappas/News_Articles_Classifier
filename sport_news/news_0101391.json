That was good news for the Trojans, as the senior took part in a second-half surge to post a 3-0 win over visiting Central Catholic . \nRAPID RECAP : Parkland boys soccer team charges past Central Catholic in 2nd half \nParkland (10-2-2, 9-2-2) looked out of sync in a scoreless first half and had just failed to convert a penalty kick (keeper Chase Missmer stopped Tyler Madeira), when Derti unleashed a thumping volley off Mark Stenske’s cross to put his team up 1-0 four minutes after intermission. \nFive minutes later, Madeira curled in a shot from the right flank, extending the lead to 2-0. Three minutes after that, Justin Evans cracked an effort that smashed off of a Central Catholic player and into the net for a 3-0 advantage. \n“Everyone just turned it on; everyone was working hard,” Derti said of the second half. “We were all working for each other. Not one player was taking a break offensively or defensively.” \nBreaks, more specifically bad breaks, are something with which Derti is all too familiar. \nThe forward missed the beginning of last season while recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament tear. He made his return midway through last fall, got back into game action and boom – suffered another full ACL tear to the same knee. \nThe senior estimates that he’s about 85 percent of the way back from his injury. He has no pain, but is still dealing with the odd feeling that comes with breaking in a surgically repaired body part. \n“Last year, I was scared to play on it, but this time I feel comfortable,” he said. “I feel great. I went through more rehab. I just feel strong and ready to play at all times.” \n“I think he’s just starting to come back to where he was as a sophomore at the beginning of the year,” Trojans coach Patrick Birns said. “I’m hoping he just keeps progressing.” \nTuesday was a positive indication as the captain was in the thick of the action while Parkland swarmed Central Catholic (9-4-1, 7-4-1), which beat the Trojans 2-0 in September. \n“When he goes, we go,” Birns said. “It’s good to see.” \nThere was no indication of Derti’s ACL history during the game, minus, of course, the big brace on his leg. The senior has learned to live with it. \n“Now, I feel great on it,” Derti said of the contraption. “I feel like it’s part of my body.” \nDerti’s desire to return never faltered throughout the rehabilitation process. \n“This is the sport I love; I don’t think I could ever stop playing it,” he said. \nProductive outings only strengthen the motivation to press forward. \n“It makes me just want it even more, just to keep playing and working hard,” said Derti, who has five goals this fall. \nWhile he doesn’t know where he’s headed, the senior hopes his progress will place him on a college roster next fall. \n“Hopefully I’ll know soon, but until then, I’ll just keep working,” Derti said. \nBecause Derti’s passion for soccer demands that he doesn’t stop, no matter what.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:10:43.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
