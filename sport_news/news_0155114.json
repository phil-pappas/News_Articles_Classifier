By Jenel Few Getting into a specialty school will be a little easier for most students next year.\nSavannah-Chatham Public Schools officials on Wednesday presented the new standardized test score criteria for admission to specialty school programs for the 2016-2017 school year.\nIn previous years students seeking admission to the rigorous, themed academic specialty schools had to earn above average scores on the CRCT state test in addition to having good behavior and a cumulative grade point average of 80 or higher in core academic courses.\nBut last year Georgia replaced the CRCT with a new state test called Georgia Milestones. Scores from that test have yet to be released, and Savannah-Chatham officials had to come up with alternative standardized test criteria for specialty program admission this year.\nIn January when specialty schools begin accepting applications for the 2016-2017 school year, applicants will still have to meet the grade point average and behavior requirements — but now Scholastic Reading Index (SRI) scores and Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) math scores will be used. Normally, applicants would have submitted their 2014-2015 CRCT scores, but now SRI and MAP scores from the beginning or the middle of the 2015-2016 school year will be required.\nThe new SRI and MAP criteria is generally compatible to the CRCT scores, but as it turns out, a slightly higher percentage of students will qualify for specialty school admission under the new criteria — particularly students applying for middle school seats.\n“When we ran the numbers, the percentage of kids who will qualify for specialty school admission was slightly higher,” said Chief Academic Officer Ann Levett.\nAdditionally, Charles Ellis Montessori officials asked that the SRI and MAP test score admission criteria be slightly lower than the previous CRCT criteria to make their Montessori specialty program accessible to more students, Levett said.\nThe one exception is Garrison Arts K8 School. Garrison officials asked that the SRI and MAP criteria for students seeking admission to their middle grades program be slightly higher than the previous CRCT criteria. Because many Garrison middle school students take high school level math, literature and Spanish courses, staff there felt students would be more successful if they are higher level achievers.\nSchool Board member Shawn Kachmar argued that the higher criteria might make Garrison even more exclusive.\n“I’m concerned that by raising the entrance requirements we are further shutting kids out,” Kachmar said.\nHis comment opened the door to further discussion about whether the district’s academic specialty programs were fair.\n“I hear all the time that we’ve re-segregated our schools through these specialty programs,” said school board member Connie Hall. “Are there kids who are very smart who are staying in their neighborhood schools or are we bleeding these schools of the best and the brightest, sending them off to specialty schools and then sitting and wondering why the neighborhood schools fail to perform on the same level?”\nSuperintendent Thomas Lockamy explained that the district began creating the academically exclusive specialty programs about a decade ago to give dissatisfied families more choice and stop a mass exodus to the private schools.\nCurrently, there are seven schoolwide specialty schools that only admit students who apply and meet the criteria — Ellis, Early College, Woodville-Tompkins, Garrison, STEM Academy and Savannah Arts Academy. There are also 16 specialty programs operating within neighborhood elementary, middle and high schools that students can apply to.\nLinks to the new specialty program criteria and CRCT/SRI/MAP equivalency tables are available at http://bit.ly/1LwkvPw and http://bit.ly/1NkkL48\nIn other business\nThe board approved a new school admissions policy, which eliminates sibling preference for Garrison Arts Middle grades and Savannah Arts Academy. Both schools have implemented admissions processes. Students who meet the academic and behavioral criteria of Savannah Arts Academy and to the Garrison Arts middle grades program will then be selected for admission based on their audition ranking.\nOnly students who earn top audition rankings will be admitted and siblings will no longer receive preference. Under the old policy all students who met academic and audition criteria were selected by lottery and their siblings received admission preference.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://bit.ly/1LwkvPw", "http://bit.ly/1NkkL48"], "published": "2015-10-07T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:27:28.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
