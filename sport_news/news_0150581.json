The transaction puts the Flyers' roster at 23 players and has them under the salary cap by $1.533 million. Sending him to the minors only saves $950,000 against his $5 million salary-cap hit. \n\"I'm not gonna talk about the process,\" general manager Ron Hextall said. \"It was a tough decision. He's an NHL player, but we were in a jam here with a roster spot and a cap issue and we've also got to put the best team on the ice Thursday.\" \nPart of that process was undoubtedly asset management. Had the Flyers opted to put Luke Schenn, who has one year left on a contract with a cap hit of $3.6 million, one of the other NHL teams may have taken a flier on him. It's extremely unlikely that a team would pick up MacDonald, who has $25.75 million left in real money on his contract for another five years. \n\"Obviously we know Mac's a good NHL player,\" Hextall said. \"Is it what we wanted to do? No. If we could have avoided it, we would. \n\"I'm convinced he's going to be back in the NHL being a productive player at some point. The dollars that everybody has, you've got to balance your cap and everything else. Sometimes it leads you to make decisions like this one.\" \nHextall said MacDonald was \"shocked\" when he gave the player the news, \"but he's a pro.\" \nMacDonald has two goals and 14 assists in 77 games with the Flyers. The Flyers picked him up approaching the trade deadline in 2014 to make a playoff run. He made an immediate impact that season, playing 21 minutes per game, but his turnover ratio began to rise and last year he was made a healthy scratch six games last season. \nIn putting him on waivers the Flyers are in danger, albeit unlikely, of losing an asset for nothing. They could have avoided that by sending 21-year-old center Scott Laughton to the minors, since he is not subject to waivers, but Laughton had such a good training camp that the Flyers thought he earned a spot. \n\"It's opening night roster and Scotty pushed hard,\" Hextall said. \"I give him credit because he had to com in here and really make us a better team and thus far that's what he's done. We're a better team with Scott Laughton on our team. Give the kid credit. He pushed the envelope and made this team.\" \nHextall was hoping to make a trade before the 5 p.m. Tuesday deadline when the NHL requires opening night rosters, but there were no takers. \n\"We tried to do some things,\" Hextall said, \"but you can only do what you can do. We'll get by it and move on and get ready for Thursday night.\" \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com.
