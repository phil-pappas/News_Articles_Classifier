By Bill Burt bburt@eagletribune.com Eagle-Tribune \nAsk Bill Belichick about what Greg Hardy said about Tom Brady and Gisele and you'll get a five-word answer ... tops. \nBut ask the Patriots coach about subjects near and dear to his heart, like old coaches and formations, etc. and he won't stop. \nWith Dallas the next foe on Sunday afternoon (4 p.m. on CBS), today he was asked about Tom Landry and the \"shifting\" the offensive line often did. \nHere was the question and, well, long answer: \nQ: In the 1950’s and 1960’s, Tom Landry came up with the shift on the offensive line. What was the point of that back then? \nBB: \"Basically what they did was they gave each player, tight end, well actually every player, they had different spots, so it could be like eight, nine, 10 spots they could line up in, and when they double shifted, which they usually did, then the player had to line up within two spots of where he was going to end up. \n\"So, the first time he could shift from A to B and then B to C, where he was going to end up, or from C to B back to C or wherever. And so when the line went up and went down, that was just another distraction and I’d say temporary loss of some vision for the defense to recognize where the back was. \n\"I’d say back when Coach Landry put it in, most all plays were two-back sets, so it was basically three formations – red, brown and blue, strong backs, weak backs and split backs. Then eventually we got into the I-formation in the 70’s, so that was kind of the fourth position, and every once in a while, you’d have a guy up on the wing in a one-back set, but that wasn’t that common. \n\"But the tendencies from those formations – I, strong backs, weak backs and split backs, on every team were I would say pretty strong in those days, depending on who the players were and the scheme, but they were still pretty strong. Strong backs, there was a lot of running strong side, weak backs, a lot of running to the weak side, split backs, a lot of running to the strong side, a lot of passing. \n\"So, there were a lot of strong tendencies. I think Coach Landry’s idea probably was to keep those tendencies from being recognized until as late as possible by the defense and force the defense to communicate, like, ‘We’re doing this on brown, we’re doing this on blue, we’re doing this on red,’ so we’re this to that, this to that and the ball is snapped, so you don’t really have time to get into your adjustments if you have any or even your final recognition, where good players that were prepared – here’s what they do out of brown, here’s what they do out of blue, here’s what they do out of red – but it’s red to brown to blue, and boom. \n\"But that line up and down was a little bit of a distraction – not distraction, but it just blocked the vision a little bit of the linebackers from recognizing exactly where everybody was until they went back down. They go on some quick counts, so it would force you to declare if you were going to do anything because they might snap it with everybody in a two-point stance, but most of the time they were up and down, and it gave the quarterback a little bit more time to watch the defense and see where they were going to go. \n\"When Ed Hughes came to Detroit – Ed Hughes was the running backs coach for Coach Landry a number of years down there – when he came to Detroit in 1977 when I was there and I coached the receivers that year, so I learned that offense. \n\"That was kind of the offense that we installed that year and ran, so it was pretty interesting. It was only one year, but it was pretty interesting to learn the Dallas offensive system because very few people left Dallas. That staff stayed together. \n\"There wasn’t a lot of movement out of there, so it was pretty interesting to learn the way that it was written, the way it was presented, the coaching points, how different plays fit off each other.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:00:25.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
