Tristan Thompson ’s contract holdout has finally been resolved. According to multiple reports on Wednesday, Thompson and the Cavs agreed to a fully guaranteed five-year, $82 million deal . That figure is well short of the max offer Thompson was reportedly demanding and a slight bump above the five-year, $80 million offer that had been on the table for Thompson all along. Call it a compromise. It only took 3 1/2 months, the majority of training camp, and a lingering pain in Timofey Mozgov’s knee to get there.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers began free agency by diving headfirst into what will be an astounding luxury tax payout. In addition to the five-year, $110 million deal doled out to Kevin Love , Cleveland re-upped LeBron James for the full max , re-signed Iman Shumpert to a four-year, $40 million contract , and brought back J.R. Smith for two years at $10 million . Assuming that Thompson’s deal begins at $14.3 million, it will cost the Cavs more than $40 million in additional tax costs in his first year alone, per the projections of cap guru Bobby Marks .\n• GOLLIVER: NBA entertainment rankings | MANNIX: Return of Open Floor\nAt this point, weighing the virtues of Thompson’s game against those costs is almost beside the point. He’ll be paid $82 million because the Cavs, the prohibitive favorites in the Eastern Conference, need Thompson in a way that Love, Mozgov, and Anderson Varejao cannot erase. Rare are players of Thompson’s defensive versatility. While he isn’t a high-caliber rim protector, his combined ability to challenge shots, wall off the basket, and keep up with quicker players off the dribble makes him a helpful utility option. In a context where defenders like Shumpert and Mozgov have more specific roles, Thompson is the systemic mortar. In the context of a fully healthy Cavs team, he gives coach David Blatt options—another active contributor, another lineup possibility, another way to win.\nNBA Video What are Tristan Thompson's services worth to the Cleveland Cavaliers? by Rob Mahoney", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/RobMahoney", "http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/10/timofey_mozgov_frustrated_with.html", "https://twitter.com/BobbyMarks42/status/656978421755547648/photo/1"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:55:49.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
