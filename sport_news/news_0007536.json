Missouri has lost two straight. \nGeorgia's Sony Michel had 26 carries for 87 yards rushing while taking over as the starter following star tailback Nick Chubb's season-ending knee injury. \nThe Tigers showed why they lead the SEC in pass defense and scoring defense. They had allowed an average of only 13.5 points per game before frustrating quarterback Greyson Lambert and the Bulldogs. Lambert's first pass was intercepted. \nThe win allowed Georgia to protect its hopes of catching SEC East leader Florida, which lost to LSU 35-28. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
