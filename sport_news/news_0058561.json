But he doesn’t pass on a chance to showcase the Middies back home. \n“Being from Dayton, it’s rich in basketball,” he said during Tuesday’s conference to announce the 14th annual Flyin’ field. “I’m proud that this tournament is actually in my hometown. To give my kids an opportunity to play in this is special for me because I believe we have the best tournament going on here and I want my kids to see what the best is.” \nThe 14th annual Premier Health Flyin’ to the Hoop will feature a record 42 teams from 12 states and 23 games over four days. Flyin’ mastermind Eric Horstman announced the field Tuesday before a throng of area coaches, players and sponsor representatives at Good Samaritan North Health Center. \nThe boys high school basketball event will be held over the Martin Luther King holiday weekend Jan. 15-18 at Trent Arena in Kettering. There will be two games on the opening Friday night, led off by host Fairmont playing Trotwood-Madison followed by a matchup between national prep school powers La Lumiere (Ind.) and Prolific Prep (Calif.). \nThere will be seven games each on Saturday through Monday, with Thurgood Marshall playing Lima Senior in the Game 23 finale. Both are ranked among the state’s top teams in many preseason polls for their respective divisions. \nMiddletown, 12-13 last season, draws Dublin Jerome in Game 21 at 5 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 18. \nThe Middies will be led by 6-foot-3 Kobie Johnson (14.9 points), 6-8 Jimmy Ratliff (10.2 points, 5.7 rebounds) and 6-10 sophomore E.J. Williams (9.9, 7.3). \n“On paper we look real good and as long as I don’t mess them up, we’ll be all right,” said Baker. \nAlso playing at Flyin’ is Lakota East, whcih is matched against Covington Catholic (Ky.) in Game 11 at 11:45 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 17. \nFlyin’ is ranked as the No. 2 high school basketball showcase in the nation by CBS Sports/MaxPreps. \nFlyin’ has featured more than 35 players who eventually landed in the NBA. It’s also had an unprecedented run of NBA lottery picks to play at Trent during the last five years: No. 7 pick Emmanuel Mudiay (Nuggets) in 2015; No.’s 1 and 2 Andrew Wiggins (Cavaliers) and Jabari Parker (Bucks) in ’14; No. 1 Anthony Bennett (Cavs) in ’13; No. 1 Anthony Davis (Hornets) in ’12; and No. 4 Tristan Thompson (Cavs) in ’11.
