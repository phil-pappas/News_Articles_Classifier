(CBS12) - One of the reasons we love football, is because it can much more than a game. One freshman at Palm Beach Lakes has always wanted to play, to honor his father. That dream seemed incredibly unrealistic - until one team made it happen\"My daddy played football, says Palm Beach Lakes High freshman Jaquan Thompkins. \"I really want to play football.\"But Jaquan has never got that chance to play. \"My mom was going to sign me up for football, just before I got hit by that car.\" That car hit Jaquan at the age of 8. He spent time in a coma, then was in a wheelchair for years. This year, Jaquan started going to Palm Beach Lakes High and he immediately wanted to play football. \"Not many people know this, but he filled out his athletic packet,\" says Palm Beach Lakes head coach Al Shipman. \"He took a physical. He's ready to go.\" Jaquan started attending practice, and immediately started fitting in. And on Monday, he finally got the chance he always wanted. The team surprised Quan by giving him his own jersey, with his favorite #7 on it. They gave him a helmet, and let him run one play. Video of that one play has not gone viral, as it shows Quan running into the end zone, with his signature limp, and scoring a touchdown.The Rams team then embraces him in the end zone.\"He scored a touchdown, and that moment was just amazing,\" says Palm Beach Lakes lineman Trevette Bridges. \"You could see the happiness in his eyes.\" \"It was the best moment of my life,\" says Quan. \"Because my daddy in heaven saw me play football. \"Other people said I couldn't play football. But look at me now. God never gave up on me.\"Shipman says the team will continue to welcome Quan at practice at on the sideline during the games, and will continue to come up with ways to get him involved.
