So when we don't have him, of course we miss him.\" \nHe added: \"Diego, without even being a leader in the dressing room - he doesn't even speak English so well to be fluent and being a leader in the dressing room - but in a game â€¦ \n\"The way he plays, the way he gives his body to the cause - because his body is always very punished - is brilliant. The team needs that.\" \nVilla marked Costa closely, at times appearing to try to provoke him, and Mourinho wants such instances to be highlighted and stamped out. \nCosta wrestled on the floor with Villa midfielder Ashley Westwood late on in the match, neither allowing the other to stand up off the ball. It appeared almost playful, but there was a kick from Costa after Westwood's hand strayed, whether accidentally or on purpose, towards his shorts. \n\"I'm pleased he didn't react,\" Mourinho added. \"But I would be even happier if the people that find his hypothetical or real negative moments were honest the other way and show and show and show. \n\"In this moment he is the bad guy and if you are telling me here that during the game this happened and you are anticipating already and saying already that in the next matches they are going to do the same, it is because it's something easy to understand. If it's easy to understand then show.\" \nCosta was prolific in the early part of last season, but has scored just three times this term. Mourinho, however, says the scoring comparisons are unfair. \n\"The team is not the same as last season,\" he said. \"The team starts badly, the team concedes goals, the team is losing and then the opponents defend with everything. \n\"I don't like to individualise. Never. It is never fair. It is difficult for the team to be bad and for a striker to be brilliant.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:47:40.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
