That would be the grandfather Justin Trudeau never knew.\nCharles-Émile Trudeau, father of a prime minister, grandfather of an aspirant to the office, was known in the Montreal of the 1920s and ’30s as Charlie, a street-smart carouser who drank hard, talked tough, punched first.\nCharlie Trudeau made a bundle off a chain of gas stations he sold just as North America’s car culture was taking off, shrewdly investing the proceeds in mines, real estate, amusement parks and the Montreal Royals baseball team.\nIf he wasn’t quite a Rockefeller, he was comfortable enough to take his extended family on a grand tour of Europe in 1933, as the rest of Canada was battening down against the Depression.\nCourtesy of Trudeau family\nPierre Trudeau with his parents, his grandfather and his two siblings on their way to Europe in June 1933. Pierre was in awe of his father, who died when he was 15.\nFinancially, Charlie Trudeau utterly altered the family trajectory. By marrying the daughter of a United Empire Loyalist of Scottish extraction, he also changed his family’s cultural makeup.\nIn ways subtle and profound, he influenced his eldest son, Pierre, by providing the wherewithal to attend Harvard and other elite universities, to travel, to indulge in a life of the mind. All of this, inevitably, would come to shape Pierre’s own children.\nUntil Charles came along, the descendants of Étienne Trudeau, a carpenter who arrived in Quebec in 1659 and got to work siring 14 children, had simple ambitions. For 250 years, they typically worked the family land around Napierville, south of Montreal.\nBut as the 20th century arrived, Joseph Trudeau and his wife, Malvina, encouraged their son Charles to aspire to something else, to get an education.\nCharles did that, and more, and in the doing he would alter the course of Canadian history.\nThe Conservative Charles died in 1935, on a road trip to Florida with the Royals ball club. His oldest son, Pierre, was just 15. “In a split second, I felt the whole world go empty,” the boy would say.\nBut Charles Trudeau had left his wife and three children a small fortune, along with legacies both positive and otherwise.\nPierre was in awe of his father, shared his athletic prowess, his gameness for the fight. Charles taught Pierre to box. Once, he dazzled his son by bringing the featherweight champ of the day to the family’s summer place on Lac-Tremblant.\nLike Charles, Pierre could be a show-off and something of a verbal bully. But it’s telling also that Pierre developed many countervailing traits in reaction to the man who dominated his world.\nCharles was frequently absent, conducting relationships with his children by postcard and letter. For his part, Pierre would become a hands-on and engaged father, reading nightly to his children, kneeling beside their beds to pray with them, tucking them in.\nWhere Charles was an extrovert, Pierre and his siblings were extremely shy. Where Charles was voluble and erratic, Pierre was reserved and controlled, his personal ethos “reason over passion.”\nPerhaps there was something, as well, in the marriage of Charles and Grace Trudeau that the son disliked. For half his life, he wanted no part of marriage, mistrusted emotion. Yet, he would end up marrying — as his parents had — someone who was more or less his opposite.\nLYNN BALL/ The Canadian Press file photo\nMargaret and Pierre Trudeau leave Notre Dame Basilica in Ottawa after baby Justin's christening in January 1972. His birth — the first to a sitting prime minister in a century — caused a sensation across the country.\nIn 1968, Pierre Elliott Trudeau became prime minister of Canada, exciting a most un-Canadian frenzy of Trudeaumania.\nThree years later, at 51, he enchanted the country once more by wedding the 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair, the daughter of a former Liberal cabinet minister and a Vancouver flower child just emerging from a protracted amble through the ’60s ethos of free love and recreational drugs.\nOn Christmas Day that year, no less, the first of their three sons, Justin Pierre James, was born and a nation celebrated.\nIn his teens, after a boyhood largely lived in public, Justin Trudeau would come to see (and to declare) that he was different from his father, even if he embodied Trudeau traits — the physical acumen, a taste for the rigorous, the zeal for testing himself — impossible to deny.\nThe most important of his father’s gifts, Justin would conclude, was that throughout an extraordinary childhood of privilege and highly public family tumult there abided plentiful and dependable paternal love.\nHis mother Margaret, the Sinclair half of his family tree that he says is too frequently overlooked, is written on him also.\nFrom her, he would say, he inherited a “zest for adventure, her joy in spontaneity, and her need to connect emotionally with the people around her.”\nCourtesy of Justin Trudeau\nJames Sinclair, a former Liberal cabinet minister, was a huge influence on his grandson Justin.\nAn unusual childhood\nIt might be that no Canadian has lived a life as comprehensively chronicled as Justin Trudeau.\nFrom the volumes written by and about his family, it’s almost possible to chart, by the week, the activities and whereabouts of the little boy code-named “Maple 3” by the prime minister’s RCMP security detail.\nTrudeau’s birth at Ottawa Civic Hospital on Christmas Day 1971 — the first infant born to a sitting prime minister in a century — was cause for national celebration.\nHis mother had turned a second-floor guest room at 24 Sussex Dr. into a nursery in robin’s-egg blue, with a pine crib, antique rocking chair, patchwork quilt. Telegrams and phone calls arrived from global dignitaries, along with thousands of letters from Canadians and more hand-knitted sweaters, bonnets and booties than his parents knew what to do with.\nMargaret called Justin “a cheerful, bright, manically energetic little boy.” Before he was 2, he was singing Richie Havens’ song “Freedom” with his hippie mum, who considered 24 Sussex the crown jewel of the Canadian penitentiary system, and whose postpartum depression heralded future mental health challenges.\nJustin soon had two younger brothers, Alexandre (Sacha) and Michel (Micha). At stodgy old Sussex Dr., the boys roughhoused like bear cubs. The room Maryon Pearson (wife of former PM Lester) had used as a Canadiana museum was soon outfitted with tumbling mats and turned into a playroom.\nThe Canadian Press file photo\nThe Trudeaus return from a trip to Europe in March 1975.\nIt was a privileged childhood. When their father took them to work, the boys played tag or hide-and-seek in the corridors of Parliament. When he travelled the world, they took turns coming along. As a boy, Justin met Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Schmidt, Ronald Reagan and other world leaders.\nAt home, Pierre — an engaged, physically demonstrative father ahead of his time — taught his sons to box, played kick-the-can, made human pyramids, jumped in the pool to play Marco Polo.\nPierre would drill them in French in history, poetry, religion, and push their boundaries “whether it was spiritually, whether it was theological challenges around religion, or whether it was intellectually with debates around the dinner table,” Justin recalled in an interview.\nIf 24 Sussex was the official residence of the prime minister and travel the perk of the job, the PM’s summer retreat at Harrington Lake, across the Ottawa River in the Gatineau Hills of Quebec, was its wonderland.\nThe estate, with its rambling two-storey wooden cottage perched on a hill, had been little used by prime ministers prior to Trudeau. Margaret loved the sanctuary and began making improvements and repairs. She said the happiest days of her marriage were spent there and she usually escaped Ottawa with her sons for the entire summer.\nAt Harrington, the boys were barely walking before learning to paddle a canoe — a Trudeau rite of passage. There was an old farmstead with an abandoned barn, an old mica mine, an unused boathouse, a tiny island just offshore.\nIt was “like the setting for a Hardy Boys novel,” Justin would recall.\nThe western home for the Trudeau boys was the Rockridge Rd. house in West Vancouver that belonged to maternal grandparents James and Kathleen Sinclair.\nJimmy Sinclair had immigrated to Canada as a boy from Scotland, becoming an engineer, a Rhodes Scholar, an RCAF officer, a Liberal MP and a cabinet minister in the government of Louis St-Laurent.\nJustin said he owed much to the influence of his grandfather and in his first question period as Liberal leader wore his Sinclair tartan tie.\nThe party leader said he recognized from an early age the privileges of his upbringing. “My father got to introduce us to amazing people,” he said. “I got to understand that, regardless of whatever station or responsibility someone had, they’re just people … That was an important thing for me to learn as a kid.”\nPeter Bregg/ The Canadian Press file photo\nPierre Trudeau was an engaged, demonstrative father, teaching his boys to box and play other sports, and also to spar verbally around the dinner table.\nThrough his celebrity childhood, his friends and their families were important to Justin.\n“When I was over and playing at friends’ houses, they showed me what a Quote: -unQuote: normal life could be like, what it is like to have a father who’s not the prime minister of the country.”\nAfter his parents separated in 1977, Margaret’s comings and goings brought tumult to the Trudeau brothers’ lives. But things settled down somewhat when Pierre and Margaret each bought their own houses in 1979, the year Pierre was briefly out of office after losing an election to Joe Clark’s Progressive Conservatives.\nLargely from the proceeds of her scandalous memoir Beyond Reason , his mother bought a house in Ottawa’s New Edinburgh neighbourhood, across the street from the grounds of Rideau Hall. Pierre purchased an austere art deco mansion in Montreal.\nWith that came stability and routine as Justin Trudeau entered the questing years of his teens. He would move back to Sussex Dr. with his father in 1980, after Pierre’s re-election.\nAnd with their father’s walk in the snow in 1984 and decision to retire from politics came a step, if not into an ordinary life, then at least out of the unrelenting national spotlight in which he’d spent wonder years worthy of the name.\nBOB COOPER/ The Canadian Press file photo\nPierre Trudeau and his three sons in 1982. After their parents split up, the boys lived with their father at 24 Sussex Dr.\nExclusive stomping grounds\nSome of the landmarks of Justin Trudeau’s early life:\n24 Sussex Dr., Ottawa In his autobiography, Common Ground, Justin recalled playing on the driveway of the prime minister’s official residence one June day with his friend Jeff Gillin. The boys were about 11. A car pulled up, the door opened, and out stepped an elegant young woman carrying a gym bag. It was Diana, Princess of Wales, who had come over for a swim and — she was “a little out of sorts” — respite from her own gilded cage. “Oh, my God!” said young Mr. Gillin. “That was incredible!”\nThe boys with their father at 24 Sussex Dr.\nHarrington Lake, Que. At the PM’s summer residence across the Ottawa River in the Gatineau Hills, the Trudeaus were, by most accounts, happiest. Pierre led frequent family hikes through the wilderness, startling the occasional party they ran into and exasperating the RCMP security detail. In winter, he led snowshoeing expeditions, spinning tales of the Mad Trapper of Rat River. “It was when we paddled or hiked together back then that we felt closest as a family,” Justin would say.\nDick Loek/ Toronto Star file photo\nMargaret Trudeau with Justin at the prime minister's summer retreat at Harrington Lake, Quebec.\nParliament Hill June 29, 1984: Pierre Trudeau spends his last day in the Commons as prime minister and his sons look on from the Speaker’s gallery. Afterwards, he asks what the boys want to do. They want to go to the top of the Peace Tower. Trudeau declines to cut in front of tourists waiting for the elevator. So the Trudeaus charge up a narrow, rarely used staircase to the top and — as if it were their own private tree fort — look out at the Ottawa landmarks, and across the river to the Gatineau Hills, at what had been the landscape of their childhood.\nToronto Star archives\nThe halls of Parliament were a playground for Justin Trudeau and his brothers.\n1418 Pine Ave., Montreal Pierre Trudeau regularly hosted dinners for celebrated guests after retiring from politics. His sons would be given a heads-up about who was coming to visit — an architect, a musician, a political figure — and were expected to bone up on his or her bio in order to carry on a decent conversation. “He expected us to be interested and active participants in very grown-up conversations,” Justin told the Star. “It was based on teaching us to listen, to ask pertinent questions and to be engaged from a young age and to be fundamentally interested in others. Kids can be fairly wrapped up in themselves and their own games, especially three boys as close as we were, and to get us to be more aware of the grown-up world, I think, was something that my father found important.”\nROBERT GALBRAITH/ THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO\nThe art deco home of Pierre Trudeau at 1418 Pine Ave. in Montreal, also known as Cormier House.\n95 Queen Victoria St., Ottawa Though it’s not easy to have separated parents, Justin Trudeau said his mother’s purchase of a house in the New Edinburgh neighbourhood of Ottawa, only blocks from the prime minister’s residence, helped the brothers handle the disruption in their lives. “We’d take the school bus in the morning to school and ignore the RCMP car driving behind us when we stayed over at my mum’s place,” he said. “In the lane, we’d just play for hours with the kids in the neighbourhood on bikes, on skateboards, goofing around — water-balloon fights and those sorts of things. That lane was a perfect place to just be an ordinary kid in what was sometimes a very unordinary childhood.”\nMargaret Trudeau's home on Queen Victoria St., near the grounds of Rideau Hall, was an escape for the boys from the fishbowl that was 24 Sussex.\nMore on thestar.com\nTonight’s $64 million Lotto jackpot biggest in Canadian history\nCanadian-flag pin barred, briefly, from Thornhill polling station", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:15:32.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
