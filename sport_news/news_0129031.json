Cleveland won 33-30 in overtime. (AP Photo/Gail Burton) \nBEREA, Ohio (AP) — Browns starting quarterback Josh McCown is practicing on a sore left ankle he injured in the closing minutes of a record-setting performance at Baltimore. \nMcCown got hurt when his ankle was rolled up on during overtime Sunday. Browns coach Mike Pettine said McCown is sore, but the 36-year-old will “be out there” at practice Wednesday as the Browns prepare to host the Denver Broncos, who have the NFL’s top-ranked defense. \nPettine said the Browns may scale back McCown’s number of snaps in practice. \nMcCown passed for a franchise regular-season record 457 yards and two touchdowns in Cleveland’s 33-30 win. He also ran for a score, threw for a 2-point conversion and helped Cleveland win in Baltimore for the first time since 2007. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:26:38.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
