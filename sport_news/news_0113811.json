WEXLER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER NV/Old Tappan’s James Weissenborn is one of the favorites in Saturday’s Division B race. Saturday at Darlington County Park, Mahwah \nDIVISION A \nRace starts : 10 a.m.\nTeams: Bergen Catholic, Don Bosco, Dwight-Englewood, Paramus Catholic, Queen of Peace, Saddle River Day, St. Joseph, St. Mary.\nFavorites: Don Bosco, Bergen Catholic, Dwight-Englewood.\nReturning Top-10 finishers: Patrick Sullivan, Don Bosco (1st); David Rosas, Don Bosco (4th); Justin Fuhrman, Don Bosco (7th).\nOther contenders: Caleb Shaia, Connor Secora and Peter Theuerkauf, Bergen Catholic; Connor Nicholson and Alex Zeepvat, Don Bosco; David Khym, Jeremy Bronstein and Zane Diaz, Dwight-Englewood.\nHow the race will go: Don Bosco has won a record nine straight titles in this division when it included public schools, and should make it 10 without a problem in this new division. Bergen Catholic should take the second automatic slot while Dwight-Englewood, which would have contended for second place in the old Division D, probably will earn the third team medal slot but miss the Meet of Champions. Rosas is running better than Sullivan this year, but don't count out the defending champ.\nDIVISION B \nRace starts: 10:15 a.m.\nTeams: Bergenfield, Bergen Tech, Fair Lawn, Hackensack, Indian Hills, Northern Highlands, NV/Old Tappan, Paramus, Ridgewood, Teaneck.\nFavorites: Indian Hills, Ridgewood, NV/Old Tappan, Hackensack, Northern Highlands, Paramus.\nReturning Top-10 finishers: James Weissenborn, NV/Old Tappan (4th in A); Nick Barnabic, Ridgewood (6th in A); Kenny Marshall, Ridgewood (8th in A); Matt Cohane, Indian Hills (6th).\nOther contenders: Jonathan Marcus, Fair Lawn; Marc Lugo, Hackensack; Steve Fiumefreddo, Derek Barney, Chris Corcoran, Tom Holster and Chris Leymeister, Indian Hills; Billy Byrne, Ridgewood.\nHow the race will go: Indian Hills has won nine of the past 11 Division B races, including the last two. And even with the addition of Ridgewood, NV/Old Tappan and Hackensack, the Braves should breeze to another win. Ridgewood should grab the second automatic slot, and NV/Old Tappan, Hackensack, Northern Highlands and Paramus will fight for wild cards, although it’s likely only two of the three wild cards will come from this group. Marshall, Byrne, Cohane and Barnabic are all capable of winning here, but Weissenborn made a statement at the Big North National meet and is the favorite.\nDIVISION C \nRace starts: 10:30 a.m.\nTeams: Cliffside Park, NV/Demarest, Englewood, Fort Lee, Garfield, Pascack Valley, Ramapo, Ridgefield Park, River Dell, Tenafly.\nFavorites: River Dell, Tenafly, NV/Demarest, Cliffside Park, Ridgefield Park.\nReturning Top-10 finishers: Colin Daly, River Dell (1st in B); Will Daly, River Dell (2nd in B); Patrick Robertson, River Dell (3rd in B); Walter Tarr, Ramapo (8th in B); Max Zavidow, Tenafly (9th in B).\nOther contenders: Nathaniel Tirado and Rob Wilson, NV/Demarest; Derek Lewandowski, Ridgefield Park; Jason Argueta, Cliffside Park; Frank Maloney and Ed Salaski, Tenafly.\nHow the race will go: River Dell is a good team and should win its first Bergen division title since 2002. Tenafly and NV/Demarest will battle for the second automatic slot, but the loser still should grab a wild card. The Dalys and Robertson should go 1-2-3 for the second straight year.\nDIVISION D \nRace starts: 12:55 p.m.\nTeams: Dumont, Glen Rock, Leonia, Lyndhurst, Mahwah, New Milford, Park Ridge/Emerson, Pascack Hills, Ramsey, Rutherford, Westwood.\nFavorites: Pascack Hills, Lyndhurst, Glen Rock, Rutherford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:30:06.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
