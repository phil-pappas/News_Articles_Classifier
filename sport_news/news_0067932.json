That led to a dislocated and fractured hip that was feared to be career-ending .\nWatts-Jackson, who was carted off the field and hospitalized following the injury, had a three-hour surgery at the University of Michigan hospital on Sunday.\n\"Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. \" very bitter sweet end to my season. This morning I had surgery on my hip putting me out for the season. But if I got the chance I would do it all over again for my brothers. God has a plan for everyone and I will not question any obstacles I encounter on my journey . #spartanswill\nA photo posted by Jalen Watts (@jalenwatts3) on Oct 19, 2015 at 1:07pm PDT\nAfter surgery and a diagnosis that revealed he'd miss the rest of the season, Watts-Jackson said on Instagram his injury was well worth it to keep the Spartans in the College Football Playoff hunt.\n\"If I got the chance I would do it all over again for my brothers,\" he wrote. \"God has a plan for everyone and I will not question any obstacles I encounter on my journey.\"\nWatts-Jackson was in the right place to catch a floating football that Wolverines punter Blake O'Neill fumbled Saturday. He returned it 38 yards to help the Spartans win, 27-23.\nReleased from hospital today üíö #spartandawg #spartanlegend #jalenwattsjackson pic.twitter.com/n0jeZahKd0\n‚Äî kyra‚ùÑÔ∏è (@kyprettii) October 19, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kyprettii/status/656206473903476736", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/spartanlegend?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/jalenwattsjackson?src=hash", "https://t.co/n0jeZahKd0", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/spartandawg?src=hash", "https://instagram.com/p/9CDIX-q6mtNuXCywYFUoRBs1KIuqd3HktazLI0/"], "published": "2015-10-20T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:28:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
