(AP Photo/Mark Wallheiser) \nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson has been hearing for most of this season that he isn’t a great passer. In his return to the state of Florida, Jackson wanted to put most of those doubts to rest. \nJackson, who grew up in Pompano Beach, Florida, and went to Boynton Beach High School, threw for 307 yards and three touchdowns but the Cardinals were unable to keep up with 11th-ranked Florida State in the second half and lost 41-21. \n“I just had to prove to them when I get the ball I can throw and run,” Jackson said. \nJackson came into the game completing just 53.6 percent of his passes and was 10 of 27 two weeks ago at North Carolina State. On Saturday he was 20 of 35 with three touchdowns and an interception. \n“We always knew during the skellies and all the other stuff we did during the summer and during camp that Lamar had a great arm, he could always sling it,” said Jaylen Smith, who had five receptions for 38 yards. \nJackson completed passes to seven players. James Quick led the way with five receptions for 130 yards and three touchdowns. \nFlorida State is off to a 6-0 start for the third straight season and extended its Atlantic Coast Conference win streak to 28, including four this year. \nFor two-plus quarters it appeared that Louisville could be in position to get its first win at Doak Campbell Stadium since 1952. Instead, it lost here for the ninth straight time. \nThe Cardinals (2-4, 1-2 ACC) had a 7-6 lead at halftime on an 18-yard touchdown pass from Jackson to James Quick. Florida State’s lone points in the first half came on a pair of Roberto Aguayo field goals. \nAfter a Dalvin Cook 54-yard touchdown put the Seminoles on top 13-7, the Cardinals scored on their ensuing drive on a Quick 19-yard touchdown reception to take a 14-13 lead. While Louisville’s first lead lasted more than 17 minutes, the second one was just 63 seconds as Everett Golson hit Kermit Whitfield for a 60-yard score up the right sideline. \nLouisville turned it over on its next two possessions which ended up leading to Florida State scores to put it out of reach. A Jackson fumble, which was recovered by Jacob Pugh, led to Cook’s second touchdown. Jackson would throw an interception to Jaylen Elliott on the ensuing drive which led to a Travis Rudolph 13-yard reception from Golson as the Seminoles extended their lead to 34-14 early in the fourth. \nCook had 28 yards at halftime but ended up having one of his best all-around games of the season. Along with 163 yards on 22 carries, the sophomore had a season-high four receptions for 60 yards. On the first touchdown, which was his fourth score of the year of 50-plus yards, he broke four Louisville tackles. \n“They really took over the line of scrimmage and when you have a guy that’s fast like he (Cook) is, and a great runner, you have to be able to tackle him well and we wore down,” Louisville coach Bobby Petrino said. “They did a really good job of working the clock and making big plays, converting third downs.” \nFor the second straight season, the Seminoles are proving to be a strong second-half team. They have outscored opponents 126-47, including 62-14 in the third quarter. Florida State remains the only team in the nation without an offensive turnover. \n“I think you saw what a team can do in the first half when it’s not totally focused or it presses itself,” Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher said. “In the second half, when the team relaxes, it played up to its capability and still have it. Just go play. I know that sounds crazy, but that’s our only goal right now.” \nLouisville outside linebacker Keith Brown was ejected for targeting during the third quarter on a catch by Rudolph. It was the Cardinals’ first ejection of the season. \n“I didn’t think that’s a defenseless player,” Petrino said. “One of the aspects of targeting is it has to be a defenseless player and I thought he had two feet on the ground and was turning to run. There’s no question that it was helmet to helmet, but I didn’t feel like it was a defenseless player.” \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball@ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:15:18.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
