Charlie Baker’s opiate bill — which will be filed tomorrow — will include a measure aimed at preventing doctors from overprescribing pills to their patients, Massachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said today on Boston Herald Radio.\n“The governor’s recommendations really target prevention, treatment, intervention, and recovery, and a large piece of the intervention is around prescribing practices,” Sudders said. “Tomorrow, the governor will file his legislation … and I believe you will see us addressing prescribing practices.\n“In the U.S., we represent 5 percent of the world’s population and we represent 80 percent of the opioids. Clearly there are far too many opioid prescriptions in people’s medicine cabinets,” she said.\nDuring the interview with “Morning Meeting” hosts Jaclyn Cashman and Hillary Chabot, Sudders also weighed in on a record $2.3 million fine levied by the U.S. attorney’s office against Massachusetts General Hospital to resolve allegations that its shoddy control over the hospitals opioid supply allowed two employees to pilfer thousands of pain pills.\n“That was one of those stunning revelations and they should have been fined, because when you have pharmacies in hospitals, you have to have the safeguards in place,” Sudders said.\nSudders said she has asked the public health commissioner responsible for licensing hospitals to review the protocols they have in place to protect their pill supplies.\n“We really want to make it a much more public licensing issue, reminding hospitals of their obligations to safeguard their pharmacies,” she said. “No question it was a wakeup call for all hospitals in the community.”\nSudders oversees the state’s largest executive state agency, with a $19.4 billion budget and 22,000 employees. The wide-ranging interview also touched upon the troubled Department of Children and Families, which is grappling with a slew of high-profile tragedies in recent months. Sudders pointed to the hiring of a new medical director and 29 medical social workers as steps in the right direction.\n“For the very first time, which is sort of a sad statement, the DCF has a medical director,” Sudders said. “The kids and families who come to DCF … are the most complex children and families in the Commonwealth and you have to have all of the resources available to you. To have to rely on contracting doctors and specialists is not serving the needs of the children.”\nSudders criticized cuts made to DCF during the financial crisis of the late 2000s, when former Gov. Deval Patrick was in office. She said some of the DCF policies had not been updated in more than a decade.\n“It was pretty distressing, frankly, to see how much had been lost in the Department of Children and Families,” she said. “The budget cuts — and not all of this is about money - that happened during the economic recession … that department should have been held harmless. It eroded the structure of management and oversight. I told the governor, ‘It sucked the life out of the agency.’”\nA lack of direction for social workers, cited in recent reports on the DCF’s shortcomings, was among the most glaring of oversights, Sudders said.\n“I am a social worker by training (and) I wouldn’t know what to do as a social worker at the Department of Children and Families,” she said. “We have made a commitment to have the structures and policies in place to make sure line social workers know what they are doing. We need to rebuild that agency.”\nSudders said she asked expects an Office of the Child Advocate review of the case of Bella Bond — the young girl who became known worldwide as “Baby Doe” when her body was found washed up on Deer Island in June — to be completed before the end of the month.\nPolice arrested Michael P. McCarthy and charged him with Bella’s murder, and charged the girl’s mother, Rochelle Bond, as an accessory after the fact. Bond had two previous children removed from her home by DCF, but Sudders said it is unclear whether case workers who were involved with Bella Bond were aware of the previous children.\n“I don’t know the exact answer right now,” Sudders said. “One of the things we have seen in a number of this cases is the DCF workers have not had the whole narrative of the family history when making decisions.”\nAddressing another hot-button issue, gun violence, Sudders pointed to more education and gun safety as a way to reduce firearm-related fatalities.\n“It’s not about gun rights, it’s about gun safety,” Sudders said. “There are a lot of responsible gun owners out there. What we need to really focus on is education and gun safety laws in the United States. The reality is…and nobody wants to hear it…is that most people who deal with mental illness are the target of violence, rather than the perpetrators of violence. And not every mass shooting is caused by someone with a mental illness.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:44:20.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
