By Mark Znidar The Columbus Dispatch • Friday October 23, 2015 4:57 AM \nAge: 17 \nGrade-point average: 3.95 (National Honor Society) \nSports: Volleyball and track \nCollege choices: Interested in Ohio University and Cincinnati as a nursing major \nQuestion: You were seen pushing a cart full of basketballs during a Division II district tournament game last winter. How much are you involved in the athletic department with your father, Andy, being athletic director? \nAnswer: Sports always have been a huge part of my life. I’ve grown up watching games on television with my father. We’ve bonded over that. Helping in the athletic department has increased that bond. I’ve helped with tournament basketball games and soccer games. We had a playoff football game last year, and I sold tickets and programs. I made sure the teams could get in and out of their locker rooms. I’ve worked concessions at the OHSAA Volleyball Coaches Association clinic here. I‘ve sold concessions at (youth) football games. \nQ: How much do you appreciate game management? \nA: I realize just how much work it takes to organize events. There is so much planning. Helping with concessions helps with the pay-to-play fee. I’ve seen the scheduling on my dad’s computer, and there’s a lot of work that goes into it. \nQ: Any funny stories? \nA: Events can get hectic, and I’m sure I’ve given some people the wrong amount of change (blushing). \nQ: Why nursing? \nA: I’ve always known that’s what I want to do, especially neo-natal nursing. I want to help babies that are struggling for their lives. That would be rewarding to help someone so fragile. \nQ: Have you done any shadowing at a hospital? \nA: My freshman volleyball coach, Hannah Byers, just got a job in the neo-natal intensive care unit at Children’s Hospital. I’m going to be shadowing her next summer. \nQ: When do you want to make a college decision? \nA: I’ve been accepted by Ohio University, and I just visited the University of Cincinnati this past weekend. I really like Cincinnati. I want to make another visit to OU to take a closer look, specifically at their nursing program. My first college visit was a couple years ago to the University of Kentucky. That opened my eyes to what I wanted college life to be like for me. \nQ: Tell us about your class load this semester. \nA: I’m taking AP literature and composition, honors anatomy and physiology, a pretty cool class called principals of biomedical science, and Algebra III. Next semester I’m taking a class called You and the Law. \nQ: Tell us about the rest of your family. \nA: My mother is Marcy. She works in surgical scheduling for a plastic surgeon in the Ohio Health building. That job can get pretty hectic. I have a sister, Chloe, a sophomore. She’s also on the volleyball team. \nQ: What’s it like having a sibling on the team? \nA: It’s great. We’ve been on the same club teams all of our lives. We have a special connection. I’m closer to her than anyone else on the team. She knows how to calm me down and get me focused. We know what each other is doing. I’m one of four captains, and sometimes I have to nag her around. I’m sure that isn’t enjoyable. She is getting used to it (smiling). \nQ: What else are you involved in? \nA: I’ve been in the Interact Club, a volunteer group. We haven’t had any meetings this year. I’m going to join Key Club. It’s a service organization. \nQ: Do you have any team bonding activities? \nA: We have team meals at school every Monday after practice. We had a team bonding campout in my backyard in early August. We made a campfire and s’mores. It really helped with team unity. When the season gets long, we look back at that great summer and keep going. \nQ: What was Senior Night like? \nA: It was interesting. There were a lot of tears. The underclassmen wrote speeches about the seniors. My sister spoke about me. That was emotional. That opened my eyes about how sad it is for the season coming to an end. I don’t want to say goodbye to the sport I’ve played for six years and to all the players. \nQ: Does your family take vacations? \nA: I play a lot of volleyball during the summer, but we do like to take weekends off and go to Lake Cumberland, Ky. We’ll get on the boat and ski and jet ski. \nQ: Are you an expert on the water? \nA: I don’t know about that. I wake-board a lot. There have been a couple of times when I don’t get up quickly enough and I drink the lake when the boat takes off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:23:29.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
