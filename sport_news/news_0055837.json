Second down, Brian Derkacs sacks Devante Cross for an 11-yard loss. Third down, incomplete. Fourth down, sack by what looked like – in a fitting way – the entire Hurricanes defensive line. \nAnd with that, Liberty had done just enough to wrap up the 41-34 win over the Trojans . \n“They really came through,” coach John Truby said of his defensive line. \nMORE : Doug Erney, Liberty football team earn signature win against Parkland \nIt took everything the Hurricanes’ defense had to hold off Parkland and they delivered just that when it mattered most. \nThe front four of Derkacs, Jaohne Duggan , Matt Richline and Devon Lindeman was disruptive for most of the night, never letting the Trojans get comfortable early on. \n“We stressed that all week that we needed to contain No. 12 (Cross),” Liberty QB Doug Erney said. “He’s probably the greatest athlete in the EPC right now, so I’m glad that we paid attention, listened to detail and executed.” \nThey, along with a mostly air-tight secondary, limited to Cross completing just seven of his first 17 attempts for 26 yards and two interceptions – one by Jayden Figueroa and another by Victor Santiago . Parkland's 6-foot-5 receiver Kenny Yeboah , a Temple commit, was limited to just two catches for 21 yards despite having a big size advantage. \n“I’m just really happy for especially our defensive secondary,” Truby said. “They were able to make some big plays towards the end of the game and really kept us in it.” \nSantiago’s pick was a huge play, getting good position on Yeboah and intercepting the ball at the 1-yard line, saving a score that would have made it a 20-14 game late in the second quarter. \nDuggan had another strong night as he continues to emerge as a threat on the line, sacking Cross twice and getting pressure on him many more times. \n“Jaohne Duggan had a heck of a game for us tonight,” Truby said. “He’s somebody that I think, if he continues to get better, he’s going to be someone to really reckon with down the way.” \nWhen it looked like Parkland had all the momentum in the second half, Justin Haynes came through with another interception – this one of Nolan Ridgway’s halfback pass. \nAnd in the end, despite allowing big plays as the lead withered away, the Liberty defense answered with the biggest plays of all to sack all hopes of the Trojans’ comeback. \n“(Parkland) is a well-coached team,” Truby said. “They weren’t going to stop until the final whistle. It was really just nerve-wracking to give them the ball as many times in the fourth quarter as we did. \n“I’m just really proud of my guys. They kept battling and kept believing each other. At one point, we didn’t have any kid getting down. They just kept believing in each other and working together. This is a great team of kids I have.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:24:44.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
