(3 things Scott Shafer said) Scott Shafer Syracuse football is heading on the road for the first time this season Saturday at South Florida, and Scott Shafer is kind of worried about his freshmen. (Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com) \nSyracuse, N.Y. â€” Syracuse football is heading on the road for the first time this season Saturday at South Florida, and Scott Shafer is kind of worried about his freshmen. \nNot about most logistical changes, like a foreign locker room and other things associated with the game. \nBut about their socks and shoes. \n\"It's more does he have his necktie? Does he have his socks?\" Shafer said during his weekly Thursday news conference. \"Inevitably, there will be one or two freshman that will show up to a team meeting wearing their sweats, and they'll have their wing tips on. \n\"It's like, how many guys are going to do that? I'm going to challenge them today to see who's the white socks guys and who's the wing tip guy? \n\"White socks with the suits, and wing tips with the sweat suit. It happens every year. The big thing for me is to not get bent out of shape over the little things.\" Freshman backs meeting expectations \nTwo of those freshmen include running back Jordan Fredericks and hybrid Dontae Strickland. \nBoth have made a mark through the first month of the season and are two young pieces that look to be key contributors for the next three years. \nFredericks leads the team with 220 rushing yards and two scores, and Strickland has been good for a chunk play almost every game, finding the end zone three times. \n\"I expected them to be good players, I really did,\" Shafer said. \"I thought they were above average in high school. \n\"I always feel like skill kids can play early in college football, a little bit tougher for the guys up front on the offensive line and D-line, but been pleased that they have met those expectations.\" What happened to kicker Alex Hodgkinson? \nShafer provided an update on what former players Ashton Broyld and Wayne Williams have been up to since leaving Syracuse. \nA much-less heralded player also did not return to the team this year: walk-on kicker Alex Hodgkinson, a British rugby player. \n\"I think it's difficult for a young man that's paying to play, and if they're not playing a lot and they don't see an opportunity ... he worked extremely hard in the offseason to try to get a chance, and, you know, unfortunately for Alex, some guys were better than him. He saw it. He knew it,\" Shafer said. \n\"He had some other things that he thought he could work on, especially academically. He's an extremely creative young man that wants to do some neat things in the business world, and he will, so he decided to say I'm going to lighten up the load with football and the time it takes to put into the program. \n\"I told him I'm going to stay in touch with him because i want to be part of some big idea he has and try to make some money off him some day. He's going to make a lot of money. He's a special guy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:57:47.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
