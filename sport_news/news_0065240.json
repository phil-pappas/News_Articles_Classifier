Ireland book Euro 2016 places By Ciaran Fahey ,APOctober 10, 2015, 12:01 am TWN SHARE Tweet BERLIN -- Portugal and Northern Ireland booked their places at Euro 2016 on Thursday, while world champion Germany was made to wait after being upset 1-0 by Ireland in Dublin. \nIrish substitute Shane Long ran onto a kick out over the German defense from goalkeeper Darren Randolph and blasted past Manuel Neuer to the top corner to ensure Group D will be decided on the final day. \nGermany, Portugal and Ireland are vying for the top two spots to ensure direct qualification. Scotland's hopes were ended when Robert Lewandowski salvaged a 2-2 draw for Poland in Glasgow. \nOne hundred miles to the south in Belfast, Steven Davis scored twice for Northern Ireland to qualify for its first European Championship tournament with a 3-1 victory over Greece in Group F. \nJoao Moutinho struck for Portugal to beat Denmark 1-0 and secure its place by winning Group I. \nHere's a roundup of action from Thursday's Euro 2016 qualifying games: \nGroup D \nShane Long's strike earned Ireland at least a playoff place with a famous 1-0 win over Germany. Ireland had never before beaten Germany in a competitive game. \nGermany had missed a host of chances through Jerome Boateng, Ilkay Gundogan and Mesut Ozil, with Ireland forced to chase the game for long periods before Long struck in the 70th minute. \nThomas Mueller missed the chance to equalize eight minutes later - a draw would have been enough for Germany - when he fired wide with the goal at his mercy. \n\"It's bitter for me and worse for the team,\" Mueller said. \nWith one game in qualifying remaining, Germany tops Group D on 19 points, one ahead of Poland and Ireland, which meet in Warsaw on Sunday. \nPoland captain Lewandowski's second goal deep in injury time ended Scotland's hopes of a playoff. \nBecause of its superior goal difference, a draw on Sunday would be enough for Poland to qualify directly, while Ireland needs to win to avoid the playoffs. \nGermany hosts already eliminated Georgia in Leipzig on Sunday, when a draw would be enough. \nEarlier Thursday, Georgia defeated Gibraltar 4-0 in Tbilisi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:03:06.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
