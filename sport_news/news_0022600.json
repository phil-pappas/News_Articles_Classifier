The shirt has the phrase \"Standing for those who stood for us\" in front of the image.\nThe symbol is considered to be a means of showing respect or to mourn for the dead in the field.\nHolmes refused to take of the shirt and was taken home by his father.\nHis brother has been showing support for the troops since his brother, a former Marine, returned from Iraq.\n\"I was just upset. I was heartbroken. My brother, he means everything for me. Just being able to help and give back to the people who fought and died for us it just makes me feel good,\" Homes said to KATU .\nSchool district officials declined to comment on the suspension, but the shirt includes the images of a gun that may have led to the decision. School policy bars students from wearing clothes promoting violence.\n8th grader suspended from school over patriotic T-shirt: http://t.co/juM0TYapzr Hear from him #liveOnK2 at 6:16AM pic.twitter.com/kdiLc0ZuBz\nâ€” KATU News (@KATUNews) October 9, 2015 Read more here.", "external_links": ["http://www.kptv.com/story/30225044/gresham-eighth-grader-suspended-for-an-image-on-his-t-shirt?autostart=true", "https://twitter.com/KATUNews/status/652472516322136064", "http://t.co/kdiLc0ZuBz", "http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash", "http://www.katu.com/news/local/Suspended-for-supporting-the-troops-331488282.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/liveOnK2?src=hash", "http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&isUI=1", "http://www.katu.com/news/local/Suspended-for-supporting-the-troops-331488282.html?tab=video&c=y", "http://t.co/juM0TYapzr"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:22:18.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
