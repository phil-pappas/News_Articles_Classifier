The Bears remain underdogs for the sixth consecutive week with the Detroit Lions still a 3-point favorite. But the Lions’ 0-5 start has also caused quite a bit of anxiety in Detroit. In the lead up to Sunday’s contest, here are a handful of eye-catching facts and figures.\n15: Turnovers by the Lions during their 0-5 start, the highest total in the NFL. The Lions committed six turnovers in last week’s 42-17 home loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Matthew Stafford leads the team with nine giveaways (eight interceptions and a fumble). Five other players have also lost one fumble each, including one by receiver Calvin Johnson on a potential go-ahead drive late in a 13-10 loss at Seattle two weeks ago. The Lions also have three additional fumbles they’ve managed to recover themselves.\n3: Takeaways by the Bears’ defense through the first five games. Both of the team’s interceptions were by outside linebackers – Jared Allen in Week 2 and Pernell McPhee in Week 4. Fellow outside linebacker Sam Acho has the defense’s only fumble recovery, diving on a juggled pitch by Raiders running back Latavius Murray.\n438: Rushing yards by Matt Forte this season, tops in the NFL. Forte holds a 33-yard lead in that category over a trio of backs – Devonta Freeman of the Falcons, Chris Johnson of the Cardinals and Doug Martin of the Buccaneers. At his current pace, Forte would rush for 1,402 yards this season. His career high for rushing yards in a season was 1,238 in his rookie season in 2008.\n322: Receiving yards by Calvin Johnson in five games this season. Johnson’s 10.1 yards-per-catch average is far and away the lowest of his career. He’s also on pace for only 1,030 receiving yards, which would be the third lowest total in his nine-year career.\n249: Receiving yards by Johnson in two games against the Bears last season, both Lions wins. Johnson caught 17 of the 28 balls thrown his way against the Bears last year and had TD grabs of 25 and 6 yards.\n31:14: Average time of possession for the Bears through five games, eighth best in the league. The Bears have dominated the time of possession battle in the first half of every game this season, using a ball control offense to shorten games. It’s a factor in why the defense currently ranks fourth in the NFL in yards allowed (304.6 per game).\n9: Sacks by the Bears over the past three games. After going without a sack in each of the first two weeks, the Bears have now moved up to 19 th in the league in that category. Pernell McPhee and Jarvis Jenkins share the team lead with three sacks apiece.\n5-5: Bears record over the past 10 years in games before their bye week. Last season, the Bears were throttled 51-23 in New England in Week 8, then came back after the open date with a 55-14 loss in Green Bay in Week 10.\ndwiederer@tribpub.com\nTwitter @danwiederer\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Detroit Lions Matt Forte NFL Calvin Johnson Arizona Cardinals Ford Field", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562109a7/turbine/ct-go-figure-bears-lions-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:30:29.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
