After a bogey at the par-3 7th hole, she put even more distance between herself and her closest pursuers with a chip-in eagle at 13 and birdies at 14 and 18.Ko's win on Sunday not only propelled her to number 1 in the world in the Rolex Rankings -- a spot occupied by South Korea's Inbee Park since June 15 -- it also made her the youngest player ever on the LPGA Tour to capture 10 wins on the tour. Park was unable to compete in Taiwan because of a previous sponsor's commitment.\"To have won my first professional event as a professional here in Taiwan, and my 10th LPGA win here, it's pretty cool and it's an exciting time,\" Ko said at a press conference after the tournament.\"Last year has been the most amazing rookie year for me…it was so much better than what I could have imagined,\" Ko said.\"After such a great year, you kind of don't know what you're coming into the year after, but this year has been so awesome. So many great memories, so many things I've learned along that journey,\" she said.While the 18-year-old Kiwi was cruising to victory on Sunday, most of the Taiwanese players were winding up forgettable tournaments. The best finish was turned in by LPGA Tour regular Hsu Wei-ling (徐薇淩), whose eagle on the final hole of the tournament left her with a four-day total of 1-over 289 to tie for 29th.Candie Kung (龔怡萍) had the second best finish among Taiwanese players, tying for 34th with a four-round score of 2-over 290.Tsai Pei-ying (蔡佩穎), who divides her time between Japan and Taiwan, was in a tie for 10th after a 3-under front nine put her at 3-under for the tournament. But a difficult back nine that saw mistakes off the tee turn into two double bogeys and two bogeys left her at 3-over 291.She finished tying for 37th place with local favorite Yani Tseng (曾雅妮) and another Taiwanese player Hsieh Yu-ling (謝瑀玲).\"I can't say I'm satisfied with the way I played. I did well for the first three days and the first half of today, but I messed it up on the back nine today. I made a lot of little mistakes off the tee and took penalties on 12 and17 that really hurt,\" said Tsai, who would have finished in a tie for 10th had she played the back nine at even par.Not surprisingly, she may also have had a case of the nerves.\"I really felt pressure on the back nine, especially after I fell back down to even par because I really wanted to finish under par,\" she said.Despite the disappointing finish, Tsai felt she has improved since last year, when she finished the Taiwan LPGA stop at the same course at 1 over par in much better conditions than this year to tie for 54th.Now hoping to earn a full-time card on the Japan LPGA Tour, Tsai said the strong winds Sunday at the Miramar Golf Country Club gave her some trouble, and hitting better drives against strong wind would be among the things she intends to work on in the near future.\"I also have to work on my tempo (of the swing) and course management,\" said Tsai, who trains most of the time in Japan because she has a Japanese coach.Though there was disappointment with the overall performance of Taiwan's players, including nine of the bottom 11 finishers being from the host country, one bright spot was the play of amateur Chang Ya-chun (張雅淳), who finished with a 4-over 292 and tied for 46th in her first LPGA tournament.The 15-year-old turned heads on Friday when she became the only Taiwanese golfer to finish under par after the first two rounds.\"I learned a lot playing alongside the pros, especially their touch on chips and their control of their shots. They can hit it consistently exactly where they want to. That's something I'm not able to do yet,\" Chang told CNA after the final round.She said the greens were more difficult than those she is used to, because they were more sloped and the cut of the grass was different. Reading the speed of the greens was also a challenge, even if the greens were a bit slower than usual because of the rain that fell on the first three days of the tournament, she said.Chang said she was generally satisfied with how she played and expected her performance to give her a confidence boost in the future.\"I will be more confident. This was my first time so I was a little nervous and I had never played this course before. Next time I will be more at ease and less nervous,\" she said.
