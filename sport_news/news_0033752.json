Posted: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 11:59 pm BASKETBALL: Despite injury, Dominique Hawkins expects to play a bigger role for UK this season Bob Flynn/bflynn@richmondregister.com Richmond Register \nLEXINGTON — Dominique Hawkins is entering his junior season with the Kentucky Wildcats this fall. \nThat makes the former Madison Central standout somewhat of a novelty with the Wildcats in this era of the one-and-done player. \nSince Hawkins’ arrival in Lexington two years ago, nine of his teammates — all freshmen or sophomores — have been selected in the NBA draft. \nAs one of the graybeards on the Wildcats this season, Hawkins said his role on the team has changed and he will be looked on to help provide leadership to another crop of very talented freshmen. \n“I’m a junior now and here a junior is an old person,” Hawkins said during UK’s annual media day Tuesday. “My role right now it to be a leader and help the younger guys out with off-court situations, school work, the fans and how to take care of all of that. On the court, to try to help them understand the kind of intensity they need to bring into practice.” \nThat role was made a little harder last week after Hawkins injured his hand during a drill in practice and had to have surgery and will miss about four weeks. \nHawkins said the injury was just a “freak accident.” \n“I was going in for a steal and got my hand caught on (Isaiah) Briscoe’s jersey and it pulled it back,” he said. “I didn’t even know I broke it. I thought I had just sprained it. But I went in for X-rays and I saw it was all chipped up.” \nAfter playing sparingly his first two seasons, an offseason of extra work had put Hawkins in position to earn more floor time this season before the injury. \nCoach John Calipari said Hawkins injury was very disappointing because this season he is in a position to get quality playing time. \n“Dom had been playing so well before he was injured. Neither he nor Derrick (Willis) really had a chance to play here until now. Now they have a chance and they get hurt, so I am really disappointed for them,” Calipari said. “Dominique was defending. He was getting into the lane. He was probably our leading three-point shooter so far. Think about that. A year ago they wouldn’t guard him. They just left him open. So it is disappointing.” \nHawkins said he had put in a lot of extra work on his shot in the offseason and the result was evident early and he can’t wait to get back on the floor. \n“I felt like I have had the best practices I’ve had since I’ve been here. I have a lot more confidence in myself and I feel like every shot I put up I am going to make,” he said. “I feel like most of the problem last year was mental. I definitely feel like I have made a mental adjustment and I just have more confidence in my shot right now. The good thing is that this happened in the preseason.” \nThis year’s version of the Wildcats will be much different from last, Hawkins said. Where the past two seasons, UK has had dominant front courts, this year the team will rely on a group of very talented guards, led by Tyler Ulis. \n“Our bigs are still very good this year. But I feel like the guard play is the biggest difference from any team I’ve been on since I’ve been here and will be our strong suit this year,” Hawkins said. “Tyler is really a floor general. I don’t know how he does it, but he can find anybody open on the floor. There will only be a small crack and he gets the ball through it. He’s so intelligent on the court and he can score, but he also gets everybody else open shots and makes you a better player.” \nHawkins has regained that confidence he had at Central and said he feels like he can be a big part of the guard rotation this season. \n“Now that I am out of that hesitation phase, I want to show everybody that they have to respect me as a shooter because I will shoot and I can make it and not just pass it up,” he said. “This year, I have a lot more confidence in myself and I think this year I can get out there on the floor and contribute, not only as a strong defender, but on the offensive end too.” \nThe Wildcats open the season with exhibition games against Ottawa Nov. 2 and Kentucky State Nov. 6. \nHawkins said he would miss those two games, but hopes to be back in the lineup when the Wildcats take on Albany on Nov. 13.
