Chris Godwin had four catches for 135 yards and DaeSean Hamilton totaled 96 yards on his five receptions. \nHackenberg, a 6-foot-4 junior, became the school leader in completions (608) and yards passing (7,453), displacing Zach Mills in both categories. \n\"Yeah, that’s awesome,\" Hackenberg said. \"For me, I don’t think that’s something that’s going to hit me until later on down the road. It was really cool to go out and get that done and have my teammates around making plays.\" \nGodwin, in turn, gave all the credit to his quarterback. \n\"He works so hard to just master his craft,\" Godwin said. \"He’s a very talented player, and he’s the leader of our team.\" \nPenn State (6-2, 3-1 Big Ten) improved to 36-2-1 against the Terps, but Maryland’s determined effort before a spirited crowd of 68,948 could help turn this into a regional rivalry. \nLocksley was promoted from offensive coordinator after head coach Randy Edsall was fired on Oct. 11. \nAlthough Maryland (2-5, 0-3) led in the fourth quarter and played its best game in a month, the result was all too familiar. \nNo. 7 MICHIGAN ST. 52, INDIANA 26 (at East Lansing, Mich.) — Connor Cook threw for 398 yards and four touchdowns as the Spartans remained undefeated with the win. \nCook fell just short of the school record of 400 yards passing, set by Bill Burke in 1999 against Michigan. The Spartans (8-0, 4-0) never trailed in the second half of this one, but it was touch and go until Cook found R.J. Shelton for a 10-yard touchdown pass with 4:57 remaining to give Michigan State a 12-point lead. \nNORTHWESTERN 30, NEBRASKA 28 (at Lincoln, Neb.) — Clayton Thorson’s 37-yard touchdown pass to Dan Vitale and Jack Mitchell’s third field goal gave Northwestern an eight-point lead in the fourth quarter, and the Wildcats hung on to win. \nNorthwestern (6-2, 2-2) bounced back from consecutive losses to Michigan and Iowa in which it was outscored, 78-10, and handed Nebraska (3-5, 1-3) its fifth loss by five points or less. \nThe Huskers have their most losses since going 5-7 in 2007. \nWISCONSIN 24, ILLINOIS 13 (at Champaign, Ill.) — Bart Houston came off the bench to throw for 232 yards and two touchdown to lead Wisconsin. \nWisconsin starting quarterback Joel Stave left the game late in the first quarter with a head injury. But the Badgers (6-2, 3-1) didn’t miss a beat with Houston. \nThe junior found his favorite target, Alex Erickson, for a 9-yard touchdown with 9:42 left in the game to give Wisconsin a 24-13 lead and effectively put the game away.
