Since last playing for England in the one-day series against Australia, he has scored just six runs off 23 balls and failed to take a wicket in 20 overs. \nBut in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports commentator Mike Atherton, Root said he and his teammates were ready to go. \n\"It's always hard to work out leading up to any series to try and work out exactly what you need to do. You never really know until you get going if you've done enough,\" he said. \n\"I think the thing with the squad of players that we've got [is] we're very mature when it comes to cricket, they know their own games pretty well. \n\"When you've got the conditions that we've got out here you've got to try to make the most of them whether it's in the game or in practice. \n\"We've had some brilliant surfaces out here in Dubai. Over the course of time that we've been here the lads have worked really hard. I feel like we're ready to go.\" \nRoot also admitted being disappointed on missing out on the one-day series with Australia, but said the break had left him refreshed and ready to go ahead of a long winter. \nHe said he was dealing with his ongoing back problems to make sure he is as pain-free as possible on the pitch. \nRoot also explained how England were taking a mental attitude of playing aggressive cricket and taking the positive option when opportunities arrive.
