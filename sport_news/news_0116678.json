He’s training at the moment,” Harley said at the end of trade period. \n“Lance will be involved for sure. He’s in preparation for pre-season mode, which is what players do now. \n“He’s in good spirits and in pretty good physical condition as well.” \nThe Swans’ senior players, including Franklin, are due to start pre-season training on December 3. \nMeanwhile, Harley was content the decision to recruit Western Bulldogs defender Michael Talia was sound. \nTalia is being investigated for leaking game-sensitive information to brother Daniel in the lead-up to an elimination final between the Bulldogs and Adelaide. \n“You obviously do your due diligence. We’re really comfortable,” Harley said. \n“You ask all the questions – talk to the player, the manager and the AFL. We’re really comfortable with where Michael is at.” \nThe Swans and Greater Western Sydney also traded down the draft to bank more points under the new academy bidding system. \n“We’ve got a net gain of 235 points, so we know that our position has improved,” Harley said. \n“You’ve got to be careful about (calling it) exploiting. They are the rules and there weren’t any trades that were knocked back as far as I know.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:09:46.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
