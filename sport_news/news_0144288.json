Yesterday was so-so and that’s to be expected coming off a break,” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said of the practices. “Today was a 180-degree turnaround from yesterday — not that yesterday was horrible, but today was very good.”\nStarting quarterback Travis Wilson also noted that things are going well.\n“We had a good day of practice today and we’re excited for this opportunity,” he said, adding that the Utes have got to keep on preparing this week.\nWilson, though, is confident they’ll be ready to go. He noted that the bye week has helped out.\n“It definitely helped out in my situation. I got to heal up a little bit and recover a little bit, got my arm back a little bit, too,” Wilson said. “So I think all in all it definitely helped this team. It’s definitely to our advantage for this week.”\nMINER MENTALITY: Beginning with Saturday’s game against Cal, the Utes embark on a season-ending schedule that includes eight consecutive Pac-12 contests without another bye week.\n“We’re about to go down in the Pac-12 cave and we’ll surface in eight weeks and see where we are,” Whittingham said.\nEXTRA POINTS: The Utes have given up just one sack this season, fewest in the Pac-12. ... Utah’s home game against Arizona State on Oct. 17 will kick off at 8 p.m. MDT. It’ll be broadcast on ESPN or ESPN2. ... A homecoming pep rally is set for Friday (noon) at City Creek Center. ... Recent recruiting commitments include defensive end Leki Fotu (Herriman HS), wide receiver R.J. Hubert (Moapa Valley HS, Nevada), linebacker Alema Pilimai (Tustin HS, California) and defensive lineman Semisi Lauaki (Leuzinger HS, California).\nEmail: dirk@desnews\nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:21:49.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
