(Alex Holt/Special to the Post and Courier) × Even without the fact that West Ashley head football coach Bobby Marion and Stratford head coach Joe Marion are brothers, Friday night’s Region 7-AAAA contest between the two high schools has major implications. Both teams enter the game with 1-1 region records and still hold out hopes of winning or sharing the region championship in a few weeks. The loser of this game is all but eliminates from contention. With teams the Wildcats and Knights battling for spots in the upcoming AAAA playoffs, it’s easy to see why neither coach is worried much about a personal victory in the schools’ Brother Bowl II. “I think last year a lot of the emphasis was on us, the coaches, because we’re brothers and it was my first year as the head coach here,” Stratford’s Joe Marion said. “This year, the kids really haven’t talked about it much. This is a big region game and we need to win it if we want to stay in the region hunt. We’re playing West Ashley and they’re a good football team.” Bobby Marion has little to no interest in talking about the matchup with his brother. “We haven’t talked about it here and we won’t,” he said of his Wildcats. “The bottom line is we need to win this game against a very good opponent. We control our own destiny in this region. If we win out, we win the region. It’s been a long time since we’ve been in the hunt this late in the season. We have to take advantage of our opportunity.” Bobby, 55 and two years older than Joe, has potentially his best team in eight seasons at West Ashley. The Wildcats are 4-4 overall with three of the losses coming to teams that are currently undefeated (Hilton Head, Ashley Ridge and Fort Dorchester). Marion led West Ashley to a school-record six wins two years ago but the 2015 Wildcats could be a more complete team. “Overall, this is one of our better teams,” Marion said. “This team is playing pretty well. We’re not as good defensively as we have been in some years but they get after it and play hard.” Joe Marion’s Stratford Knights also sit at 4-4 overall heading into the showdown. Like West Ashley, Stratford still has Goose Creek on the schedule so a victory Friday night keeps both teams in the hunt. The Knights have losses to Cane Bay, Sumter, Ashley Ridge and Fort Dorchester. After a 1-3 start, Stratford has won three of its last four games. “We’re getting better but it’s been a crazy season with the weather so I’m not sure where we are right now,” Joe Marion said. “I think we have a great opportunity in these last three games to really improve and find out where we are as a team. West Ashley certainly will be a tremendous test for us. I think this is Bobby’s most complete team since he’s been there.” The brothers have met twice before as head coaches. Bobby’s St. Stephen Academy team beat Joe’s Andrews Academy team, 21-7, back in 1986. Last year, Joe’s Knights evened the score, winning, 20-19, after blocking a potential game-tying extra point in the final minutes. The two served on the same staff at Stratford under long-time head coach Ray Stackley – Bobby as offensive coordinator and Joe as defensive coordinator – before Bobby left for the position at West Ashley in 2007. “We talk every week, and we’ve talked this week,” Joe Marion said. “We talked during the weather issues about how we were doing things in practice and preparation. We’re football coaches and coaches talk. That won’t ever change.” Enlarge Stratford coach Joe Marion and the Knights edged brother Bobby Marion and West Ashley last season.
