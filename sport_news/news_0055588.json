He moved ahead of Spieth on September 21, but lasted just a week as the American won the Tour Championship to regain top spot. Neither player was in action last week, which ensured that Day would edge ahead based on the rankings formula with 12.42 points average to 12.40 for Spieth. Former world No. 1 Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland remained in third place on 10.92 points, well ahead of the rest of the pack led by American Bubba Watson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:55:26.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
