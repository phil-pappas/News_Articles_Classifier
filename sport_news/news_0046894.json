I think that’s the main reason why.”\nThe Red Sox list Ramirez at 225 pounds, but he reported to spring training at 240, 10 pounds heavier than last season with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Earlier in his career, when he was an All-Star shortstop for the Florida Marlins, Ramirez was rail-thin and barely 200 pounds.\nRamirez hasn’t played since Aug. 26 because of a strained right (throwing) shoulder. The Red Sox held out hope that he might be able to play in a few games at first base, but after abandoning that idea a few weeks ago, they allowed him to leave the team last week to continue his rehab at his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home.\nIt seems likely the Sox will try to trade Ramirez, who is owed $66 million over the next three seasons. If Ramirez is with the team in spring training, president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski has said the plan is for him to play first base.\nLovullo isn’t aware of any consequences if Ramirez — or notoriously overweight third baseman Pablo Sandoval, for that matter — doesn’t adhere to the conditioning plan that has been outlined for them.\n“We’re not picking on Hanley as an organization,” Lovullo said. “These are all very common conversations we have with guys. We set up goals for what you need to look like when you come to spring training.\n“I know sometimes he’s an easy target, but this is not the case. We’re trying to do the best thing for Hanley, and this is what we outlined.”\nLovullo said he’s unaware of the exact weight-loss goal for Sandoval, who has been heavy throughout his career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:15:43.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
