The pair finished the 56km section of river, with nearly a 400m gradient, over three days. \n\"The Keve River was super-isolated, with massive portages followed by endless sections of whitewater,\" Dawson said. \nThe pair will now head to Bengo Falls, then explore Kissama National Park and Angola's shoreline. \nPolitical reforms have gradually opened Angola up since the end of a 27-year civil war in 2002, although safety is still precarious in the mineral-rich country. \nSponsored by Ortlieb, the Expedition Angola trip also involves filming, mapping and documenting the rapids and flow of the rivers in these remote, uncharted gorges. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:02:18.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
