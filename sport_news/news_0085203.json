So now, I’m asking for prayers.”\nNorris, who started the 2015 season in Toronto, found out he had a malignant growth on his thyroid after being sent to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. After consulting another doctor, he was given the option “to shut my year down and get it removed immediately” or to wait until the end of the baseball season.\nThe latter option, Norris wrote, “reassured my gut feeling.”\n“Baseball kept me sane,” he said. “Regardless of results on the field, I forgot about it when I was between the lines.”\nNorris was a second-round draft pick of the Jays in 2011, and moved through the system quickly, particularly in 2014 when he played at four levels, finishing the year with Toronto. The popularity of the Johnson City, Tenn., native grew in the off-season when fans discovered he was living out of his van on the way to spring training.\nHe was rated the 18th-best prospect in baseball entering this season, but struggled with his control in five starts with the Jays before he was sent to Triple-A. While he struggled at times in Buffalo — he went 3-10 with a 4.27 ERA in 16 starts — Norris was the key piece for Detroit in the multiplayer deal that brought left-hander David Price to Toronto at the trade deadline in late July. He went 2-1 with a 3.68 ERA in eight starts with the Tigers, and homered in his first-major-league at-bat.\nAl Avila, who replaced Dave Dombrowski as the Tigers GM shortly after the trade deadline, says the team knew about Norris’s condition when they acquired him. They expect him to recover in full.\n“I was just trying to get the heck out of Triple-A,” Norris wrote. “And I did. I was revived with an opportunity, a blessing from God, with the Tigers back in the big leagues.\n“Now that it’s over, it’s time to get this thing out, so please keep me in your thoughts as I undergo surgery and come out 100 per cent cancer-free.”\nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons, while suggesting Norris was part of the team’s success and a big reason Toronto was able to acquire Price, said “you’re talking about life here, health issues.”\n“I was fortunate to be around him,” Gibbons told the Star’s Richard Griffin. “He’s a different cat. He beats to his own drummer. But he was a part of this . . .\n“It really puts things in perspective. I sure hope he’ll be fine.”\nNorris’ former teammate and good friend with the Jays, Dalton Pompey, offered his thoughts.\n“I remember him telling me that had gone to the doctor for something in his throat. I didn’t think anything of it and he said not to worry, and now obviously it’s escalated into something else,” said Pompey, who played with Norris in Buffalo this season.\n“He’s one guy who doesn’t dwell on negativity. And he’s in tune with God as well and I know he’s going to be alright and he’s going to get through this.”\nWith files from Star wire services\nMore on thestar.com\nKansas City Royals confident in starter Chris Young despite fly-ball tendencies\nBlue Jays fans cling to hope for Game 3 against Kansas City Royals", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:19:21.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
