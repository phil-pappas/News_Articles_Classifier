Smith or Skip Bayless !\nDuring a discussion about LSU running back Leonard Fournette on College Football Live , ESPN analyst/former NFL player Joey Galloway suggested that the idea of Fournette sitting out next season to prevent himself from getting injured is silly.\n“That’s like saying, ‘Don’t drive a car because you might get in an accident,’” Galloway said.\nHis fellow analyst/former NFL player Trevor Matich responded by saying, “When you drive a car, you don’t have SEC defenders diving into your legs 25 times a game.”\nGalloway’s response? “No, you’ve got women driving!”\n*record stops*\nFortunately, College Football Live host Chris Cotter pumped the brakes on Galloway’s comments immediately, and Galloway apologized before they all moved on. But that pr bably wasn’t a great way for Galloway to go about making his point.\n Uproxx ]", "external_links": ["http://uproxx.com/sports/2015/10/joey-galloway-sexist-joke-women-drivers-espn/"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:25:32.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
