When Lou Lamoriello and Mike Babcock decided on 15 cuts to Maple Leafs camp on Sunday, the young guns were at the front of the list to return to the Marlies, even though some outshone the veterans in camp. \nWilliam Nylander, Connor Brown, Kasperi Kapanen and Zach Hyman were among those re-assigned, 10 to the Marlies, five mostly journeymen put on waivers and the previously hurt Petter Granberg to non-roster injury status. \nAt practice on Monday, Babcock will be down to 24 bodies to work with in preparation for Wednesday’s opener against the Montreal Canadiens, 23 of whom must be named to the official roster at 5 p.m. Tuesday. \nIn the latter group are many remnants from last year’s downtrodden team and a few newcomers who struggled at times to grasp Babcock’s ambitious makeover of tactics or had rough spots in eight exhibition games, the final five ending in losses. \nGeneral manager Lamoriello, heeding club president Brendan Shahanan’s edict to give the kids a winning environment on the farm before exposing them to the Leafs rebuild, handed them to Marlies coach Sheldon Keefe. \n“They did extremely well, they have extremely bright futures,” Lamoriello said on a conference call after the cuts. “But this is the right decision to see who we have here and what they bring. A lot of decisions will have to be made. The (kids) could be back here before you know it, or it could take time.” \nBet on the latter, as the Leafs didn’t even keep any for the nine-game measuring stick many NHL teams use on junior prospects without risk of burning a year of their entry level contracts. \nBoth Babcock and Lamoriello said they simply didn’t know their new Leafs well enough to make harsh judgements based on a three-week camp. It appears they’re getting the benefit of the doubt to work out their kinks. \n“The first thing is finding out where the veterans are,” Lamoriello said. “We’ve seen (players turn it on in October) in the past. I had no preconceived notions. But I was pleased with the last couple of games and those who started to play.” \nTrue, the back-to-back losses to Detroit did see the Leafs execute better, while parts of forward lines were snapping together. \nNazem Kadri between James van Riemsdyk and Brad Boyes had chemistry in a 2-1 loss Saturday, the night after Tyler Bozak, Joffrey Lupul and Shawn Matthias had some chances. Kadri played both nights, centring van Riemsdyk and Daniel Winnik on Friday. \n“We played lots of the guys back to back,” Babcock noted. “We knew they wouldn’t have much juice (for Saturday), but they dug deep, didn’t even try to play foolish or be careless with the puck. \n“I thought we looked like a hockey team. It was important for us to follow up on the way we played in Detroit. We have to get used to doing it right. It’s just got to be what you do every day you come to the rink. You’ll have the odd night where you play better than the other team and don’t win. But normally when you do it right, if you don’t get a win you get some points.” \nHeading to the Marlies are forwards Nylander, Brown, Kapanen, Hyman and defenceman Stu Percy, joined by goalies Antoine Bibeau, Garret Sparks, defenceman Rinat Valiev and Viktor Loov and forwards Rich Clune and Nikita Soshnikov. \nAnother group of Marlies from the first wave of cuts has been barnstorming in Newfoundland. \nPlaced on waivers by the Leafs Sunday were defenceman T.J. Brennan, Andrew Campbell and forwards Sam Carrick, Byron Froese and Matt Frattin, all destined for the AHL if they clear in a couple of days. \nLamoriello spoke to all five on Sunday. \n“No disrespect to them, but this is the process you go through. I look forward to them playing for the Marlies, but (another team grabbing them) is not in our control.” \nLamoriello, like many GMs, saw no reason to keep a large group in the main camp with Wednesday looming and thus cut to one over the maximum. \n“We didn’t want to hold back, we wanted to get players to the Marlies (they open the AHL season on Friday) and get closer to the number we could (comfortably) use for practice,” Lamoriello said. \nWhen one player is removed, it could be Richard Panik or Mark Arcobello up front and Scott Harrington or Martin Marincin on the blueline. \nLamoriello wouldn’t comment on whether the Leafs will carry two extra defenceman and one forward or vice-versa. But wear and tear on the blueline is always a consideration and Toronto already has 38-year-old Stephane Robidas in its group. \nLamoriello said Harrington, acquired in the Kessel trade, and former Edmonton Oiler Marincin were two surprises. \n“They got better and better in camp. I don’t know much about either one, maybe Harrington because he was (in the Eastern Conference near New Jersey). We’ll see where the final decision is.” \nUPDATED LEAFS ROSTER", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:10:21.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
