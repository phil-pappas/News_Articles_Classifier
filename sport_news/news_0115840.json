Senior twins Sadraque and Kallebe Ferraz each scored a goal to lead Randolph High to a 2-1 South Shore League boys soccer win over Rockland on Monday afternoon. The Blue Devils (8-1, 6-1) have won eighth straight since dropping their opener to Norwell. “It was a refusal to quit,” Randolph coach Ed Weiand said of the victory. “They played tough.” Randolph opened the scoring 16 minutes into the game when Kallebe Ferraz found the back of the net on a header off a corner kick from senior Jimsky-Jean Hillaire. “Kallebe is starting to play really well,” Weiand said. Not to be outdone by his brother, Sadraque followed with a goal of his own four minutes later. His strike from more than 25 yards out pushed the lead to 2-0. Sadraque Ferraz won a slew of awards last season – he was an All-State selection by the Eastern Mass. Soccer Coaches Association, a South Shore League All-Star, a team MVP (for the second time) and a Patriot Ledger All-Scholastic. He entered this season as the program’s all-time leading scorer with 80 goals and 22 assists. Said Weiand: “Sadraque, without question, I think he’s one of the best players in the state, if not the best player in the state.” The brothers have been playing together since freshman year and, predictably, have great chemistry on the field. “It’s nice playing with him,” Sadraque said. “He’s a midfielder, I’m a striker and he passes me the ball a lot so I can score.” “I’ve had other sets of brothers,” Weiand said, “and these two twins are some of the best brothers I have ever had.” Despite the quick start for Randolph, Rockland was able to respond in the 23rd minute, when Gustavo Ribeiro fired a missile into the back of the net to cut the deficit in half at 2-1. Rockland (4-3) spent the next 60 minutes trying to push home the equalizer, but to no avail as the Bulldogs were unable to finish their chances. “We know that when our back is against the wall, we are going to push as hard as possible,” Rockland coach Rich MacAllister said. “We just couldn’t get them to drop today.” Much of that had to do with the stellar play of Randolph’s first-year goalkeeper, senior Danny De Pass (six saves). “(He’s) been fabulous,” Weiand said of his keeper. Page 2 of 2 - Ribeiro had a couple of chances late, but they both sailed just over the crossbar. “Everyone’s stepping up, everyone’s working hard,” MacAllister said. “Really our problem right now is we need to work on finishing.” Both teams return to action on Wednesday, with Rockland facing off against Mashpee and Randolph looking to avenge its lone loss at Norwell. “Just go after them,” Weiand said of the matchup with the Clippers, who lost in the Division 3 state semifinals last season. “We’ve come a long way from that first game and we’ve won eight (straight). There’s no question that I think Norwell and us are probably the two best (South Shore) teams.” David Konowitch The Patriot Ledger, Quincy, MA David Konowitch Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 11:00 PM Updated at 11:09 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:11:32.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
