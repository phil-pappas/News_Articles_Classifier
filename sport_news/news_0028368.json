Roger Goodell is in his 10th season as NFL commissioner. (Photo: Dennis Wierzbicki, USA TODAY Sports) 198 CONNECT 3349 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 31 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW YORK — NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says he has no regrets about aggressively pursuing discipline against Tom Brady in the so-called Deflategate scandal, even after a federal judge overturned the New England Patriots star quarterback’s four-game suspension last month. \nThe league has appealed U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman’s decision to vacate Brady’s ban, which Goodell previously upheld in his role as arbitrator after finding Brady participated in a scheme to deflate footballs used in January’s AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts. \n“I have a lot of respect and admiration for Tom. I know him personally. I admire him tremendously, and he’s a future Hall of Fame player. But our rules apply to everybody,” Goodell said at the conclusion of the NFL’s fall meeting Wednesday. NFL owners look to expand international games, possibly to Mexico and Germany \n“They apply to every single player, and every single player expects those rules to apply to everybody. Every coach does, every fan does, every partner, every team does. So our rules and the integrity of our game aren’t because somebody’s popular or somebody’s a Super Bowl champ or not. They’re to be applied evenly. Our teams expect that, and that’s our job. That’s our responsibility. That’s my job. \n“So no, I don’t regret that, and we will continue to uphold the integrity of the game, and we’ll do that as vehemently as we can.” \nBerman’s decision, issued Sept. 3, was based on inadequate notice and due process grounds. The NFL appealed to the 2nd Circuit the same day — an appeal Goodell reiterated Wednesday was about protecting the commissioner’s power over discipline under the league’s labor deal. \n“This isn’t about any individual player or any individual incident,” Goodell said. “This is about the rights that we negotiated in 2011, the rights for us to have the authority to make sure we discipline. Record pace of NFL penalties lengthens games by about four minutes \n\"Protecting the integrity of the game is not something we’re going to compromise.” \nGoodell noted what he called “very healthy discipline numbers” discussed at Wednesday’s meeting, citing a 35% reduction in violations of the personal conduct policy since presumptive discipline under that policy was increased in the wake of the Ray Rice incident and other issues last year. \nThe NFL also tweaked its policies on handling game balls in the wake of Deflategate to include, among other things, the testing, recording and removal of footballs at halftime of random games beginning this season. Goodell said he wasn’t sure if that data would be made public. Brennan: Greg Hardy remains unapologetic, yet will be cheered on Sunday \n“I think the most important thing we’re trying to ascertain is that the balls in play are within the regulations that were established,” Goodell said. “That’s the core of the issue is protecting the integrity of the game and making sure that the game is played within the rules. We’re a game of rules, and the rules need to be followed by everyone.” \nBrady has nine touchdown passes and no interceptions this season. The Patriots are 3-0. \n*** \nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero \nPHOTOS: NFL power rankings Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 1. Patriots (1): The last time Tom Brady made a visit to Dallas, he torched the Cowboys for five TD passes. Welcome to JerryWorld, Tom. David Butler II, USA TODAY Sports 2. Packers (2): If only they'd been able to solve Colin Kaepernick that well in the playoffs. Still, a merely solid D makes Pack scary good. Cary Edmondson, USA TODAY Sports 3. Bengals (5): Bend-but-don't-break defense kept Chiefs out of end zone ... and also allowed seven field goals. Less bend, please. Aaron Doster, USA TODAY Sports 4. Broncos (4): The best passing attack in the league but only ranked 25th when it comes to stopping it. Wait, we have that backwards? Wow. Chris Humphreys, USA TODAY Sports 5. Panthers (6): The stats are hardly mind-blowing, but the MVP talk that's percolating around Cam Newton is legit nonetheless. Jonathan Dyer, Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY Sports 6. Seahawks (7): Since Kam Chancellor returned, D has allowed 3 points in two games. His strip of Megatron (and refs) helped Monday. Joe Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports 7. Cardinals (3): Now we learn about the Cards, who play four of next five on road with three of those dates set in the Eastern time zone. Matt Kartozian, USA TODAY Sports 8. Falcons (10): Perhaps the biggest early season surprise? Devonta Freeman is the league's leading scorer with 42 points. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports 9. Jets (14): RB Chris Ivory and QB Ryan Fitzpatrick are playing their roles well. But defenses should pack the middle against both. Steven Flynn, USA TODAY Sports 10. Giants (18): This defense doesn't do anything halfway. No team is allowing fewer yards on the ground. No team is allowing more in the air. Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports 11. Bills (8): Really, 47 penalties already? That puts Buffalo on track to commit 188 this year, which would break the NFL record by 25. Timothy T. Ludwig, USA TODAY Sports 12. Steelers (12): Some casualties last week, including Josh Scobee and Antonio Brown's 35-game streak of 50-yard games. Overall, they're fine. Jason Bridge, Jason Bridge-USA TODAY Sports 13. Rams (16): Talk about balance -- Jeff Fisher's troops produced 164 yards through the air and 164 on the ground. Hello, Todd Gurley. Matt Kartozian, USA TODAY Sports 14. Vikings (9): Back on top of the rushing charts, looks like Adrian Peterson is finally settling into Norv Turner's offense. Chris Humphreys, USA TODAY Sports 15. Colts (11): Maybe their Luck is turning given fluky ending to their win over the Jags. But Indy could definitely use Luck in the lineup. Thomas J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports 16. Raiders (15): If you're keeping track (and we are), that's now 388 yards and six TDs allowed to opposing tight ends in four games. Jerry Lai, USA TODAY Sports 17. Chargers (17): Manti Te'o is finally showing up in the box score. On Sunday, he had 13 tackles with two coming behind the line. Jake Roth, USA TODAY Sports 18. Ravens (21): I'll take Baltimore wide receivers not named Steve Smith for $200, Alex. Who is ? Jason Bridge, USA TODAY Sports 19. Redskins (26): When speedster DeSean Jackson comes back, their top-ranked rushing attack might actually hit another gear. Geoff Burke, Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports 20. Cowboys (13): If you're Matt Cassel, aren't you asking for another week to study the playbook rather than jockeying to face the Patriots? Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports 21. Chiefs (19): Wasn't defense supposed to be their calling card? No team has given up more points than Kansas City's 125. Aaron Doster, USA TODAY Sports 22. Saints (30): Drew Brees wasn't happy to lose Darren Sproles and Jimmy Graham in successive offseasons. But C.J. Spiller's a nice consolation. Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sports 23. Titans (24): They won't be on the road again until November. Now's the time to show if they can really factor in the AFC South race. Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY Sports 24. Eagles (20): DeMarco Murray broke off a 30-yard run Sunday. His 28 other carries have added up to 17 yards. Yep, he needs more work. Rob Carr, Getty Images 25. Texans (25): If they can get Arian Foster going, this team still has time to make noise on what looks to be a very winnable division. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports 26. Lions (23):Has a controversial ruling from the officials ever worked in favor of poor Calvin Johnson? Joe Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports 27. Jaguars (29): Yeah, they let one get away. But Fantasyland rejoiced. Jacksonville's 431 yards Sunday were offense's most in three years. Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY Sports 28. Buccaneers (27): Maybe they should be volunteering to play in London. It's been two years since they won a game in Tampa. Jonathan Dyer, USA TODAY Sports 29. 49ers (28): We've now officially determined Colin Kaepernick 'ain't Russell Wilson, bro.' Niners fans might add he ain't Alex Smith, either. Cary Edmondson, Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports 30. Browns (31): So apparently THAT is why Mike Pettine keeps starting Josh McCown. Can Johnny Manziel play defensive back maybe? Jake Roth, USA TODAY Sports 31. Bears (32): A really nice game-winning drive Sunday by Jay Cutler. Will his trade value ever creep any higher? Jerry Lai, USA TODAY Sports 32. Dolphins (22): Perhaps the biggest indictment of Ndamukong Suh? The Jets ran right at him Sunday. Very successfully. Steven Flynn, USA TODAY Sports Like this topic?
