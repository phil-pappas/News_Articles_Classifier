(AP) - Vermont State Police say a father and daughter responding to a burning car on Interstate 91 broke a window and pulled out the trapped driver to safety.\nWitnesses said Michael and Marie Lajoie of Maryland heard the driver calling for help as they approached the car in the median in Springfield early Friday. They couldn't see anyone due to the smoke. The driver, identified as 66-year-old Gene Farnham of Claremont, New Hampshire, was unable to unlock his doors or put his windows down.\nMichael Lajoie broke the rear passenger side window and the father and daughter dragged Farnham from the burning car moments before it became fully engulfed in flames.
