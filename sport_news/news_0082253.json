Principal Michael White remembers Frost’s quick smile, easy-going manner and hard work. Both hope those memories — and many more — will be shared at Friday’s football game when Frost’s No. 1 jersey is retired during a halftime ceremony. Frost, 25, was shot to death April 20 in New Bern while on his way to work. “His mother and father, his brothers and sisters will be out there,” White said. “We want to remember Covair for who he was and what he stood for.” Frost was the starting quarterback for the Trojans in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 seasons, helping lead the school’s football renaissance that culminated with conference championships in his junior and senior campaigns. Davis was an assistant coach on those squads to Greg Hampton, his good friend and current assistant coach. Davis said Frost was not a “rah-rah” vocal leader, but a quiet and effective mentor. “He didn’t say much but when he did, you knew he meant it,” Davis said. “He had a lot of courage and pride and carried himself well. He was one of those who were like, ‘Don’t do as I say do, do as I do.’ He was that type of leader even when he was an underclassmen.” The football program had fallen on hard times before Hampton, Davis and Frost arrived. In 2004 and 2005, the Trojans were a combined 2-22. When Frost and his teammates were freshmen, they won the junior varsity league title. “Even when they were over at the middle school, coach Hampton and I had seen this was going to be a special class with Covair,” Davis said. “We really didn’t want to pull them up when they were freshmen so we left them down on JV. When he was pulled up to varsity for his sophomore year, you could see him and the team start to turn the corner.” However, the turnaround didn’t come overnight. Although Frost was the team’s starter as a sophomore in 2006, they lost their first three games on the field — all road games — at Richlands, Union and Goldsboro. After the Goldsboro game was later turned into a victory due to a forfeit, the ball started rolling for Frost and the Trojans. They only lost twice more during the regular season before advancing to the third round of the 1-A playoffs to finish 9-5. Frost’s junior and senior campaigns finished with back-to-back Coastal Plains 1-A championships and a 12-2 record in 2008. In his three-year varsity career, Frost led Jones Senior to a 30-12 mark. Page 2 of 2 - That success helped prepare the Trojans for their run to the 1-A championship game in 2011. That run is even helping this year’s team, which enters Friday’s game against Lejeune with a 2-4 record after a 1-21 record in 2013-14, the coach said. “I used to tell Covair and his teammates to look across the fence at youngsters,” Davis said. “I’d tell them, ‘Those kids are going to be looking up to you on Friday nights. What you do on Friday nights is going to resonate with them for a long time. They’re going to want to be like you.’” White was the assistant principal during Frost’s senior year at Jones Senior in 2008-09. He helped Frost with his senior project, which was haircutting. White videotaped Frost’s presentation. “Covair was always about working hard and bettering himself,” White said. “He took the SAT three times to get better with it.” White said his favorite memory of Frost was revealing he’d been accepted by East Carolina. “I called him out of class to come and read the email,” White said. “He read aloud, ‘Covair Frost has been accepted.’ He said, ‘So?’ I told him to read where it was from and a big ol’ smile broke out on his face. He grabbed my hand, pulled me out of my chair and said, ‘Thank you! Thank you!’ I told him he did it by taking the SAT three times.” Frost was a walk-on for the ECU football squad, but later left the team. He eventually received his barber degree from Craven Community College and was a beloved member of the Maysville community. That adoration was on full display after his untimely death in April. A day after his passing, hundreds of people honored his memory by assembling at Maysville’s Frost Park and many more attended his funeral. During Friday’s game, Jones Senior players and coaches will be wearing red wristbands with “No. 1” on them. “The wristbands represent, ‘Stop the Violence’,” White said. “Hopefully, we’ll have extra ones for people in the stands.” Added Davis: “I want everyone to know that Covair did not play for himself, he played for his teammates, he played for his school, he played for his community. He put everyone above himself. When we take the field Friday night, we want to play like Covair Frost — we want to play for those gone before us and we’re going to play for those coming after us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:55:07.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
