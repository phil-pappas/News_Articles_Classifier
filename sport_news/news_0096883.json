(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)   9:25 pm Swamp shocker: No. 25 Florida swamps No. 3 Mississippi 38-10 Associated Press | \nGAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Will Grier threw four touchdown passes to four receivers — all in the first half — and No. 25 Florida upset third-ranked Mississippi 38-10 on Saturday night to give coach Jim McElwain a signature win in his first season in Gainesville. \nThe redshirt freshman battled a stomach virus for two days before the game — feeling so ill that the Gators (5-0, 3-0) thought there was a chance Treon Harris might get the nod — but Grier started anyway and was sharper than ever. \nGrier was sick all right. \nHe was downright nasty against the Rebels (4-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference). \nHe completed 24 of 29 passes for 271 yards. He was poised in the pocket, precise with every throw and even closer to perfect than he was down the stretch against Tennessee last week. \nMcElwain, meanwhile, became the first Florida coach since Steve Spurrier in 1990 to open his first season 5-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:41:56.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
