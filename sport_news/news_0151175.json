A few players departed through free agency or weren't pursued and they are replaced by younger players with a boatload of potential.\nThe most notable addition is Alex Burmistrov, back from the KHL and ready to try to become a more complete NHL player. Others who were expected to at least break camp with the team included top prospects Nikolaj Ehlers and Andrew Copp.\nThey will mix in with a core that remains largely unchanged, with the likes of Andrew Ladd, Blake Wheeler, Bryan Little, Mark Scheifele, Dustin Byfuglien, Mark Stuart and Ondrej Pavelec leading the way.\nWhat has the players believing they can repeat last year's performance is the system implemented by head coach Paul Maurice, who deserved more consideration than he received for the Jack Adams trophy as NHL coach of the year last season.\nIt took a few months for the players to fully grasp the system, but once they did, the team really took off. If they can get the new players to buy in, there's no reason to believe they can't pick up where they left off.\n“It’s another year under the same sort of system and we really came together last year and we were playing at a really high level, playing really fast,” Wheeler said. “We want to build on that and we know there’s room for growth. I think we were just scratching the surface last year.”\nWhile the Jets haven't improved their personnel since the end of last season, they look better on paper than they did when training camp started last year. The distraction of Evander Kane is gone, along with defenceman Zach Bogosian and replacing them are high-end blue-liner Tyler Myers and solid veteran winger Drew Stafford.\nThey certainly could have done more to improve their forward lines, especially since Michael Frolik bolted for Calgary and most of the other Western Conference teams made significant improvements that will make the playoff chase even more intense.\nThose facts might make fans think twice before booking their 2016 playoff tickets just yet, but they do nothing to quell leading goal-scorer Wheeler's enthusiasm.\n“We all bought into the system last year and that’s why we were good,” Wheeler said. “We weren’t the most talented team on any given night, but for the most part, we were the most structured team.\n“I love our group. I love the way we play and I love the message from the coaching staff.”\nWheeler isn't the only one with the right attitude. Coming off his personal best season, which coincided with the team's finest campaign, goalie Ondrej Pavelec said no one should be satisfied with last year. After all, they didn't win any more playoff games than teams that missed the post-season.\n“We made a step forward for sure and it was a great feeling to play in the playoffs, but it ended pretty quick and we are going to try to go farther this year,” he said. “There’s always room to improve and we are going to try to get better.”\nTruly that's all fans of the Jets can ask for. They've been patient with this organization through the first four seasons and were rewarded with playoff hockey last spring.\nThe patience is still required as there are still many things that can go wrong, especially on such a young team.\nBut as we present to you our comprehensive fifth annual Winnipeg Jets/NHL season preview, it's fair to say that this is an organization headed in the right direction.\nClick here to get a Jets calendar you can subscribe to.
