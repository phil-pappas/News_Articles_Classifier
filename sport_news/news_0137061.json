A 2km fun race will be held at the same venue, starting at 4.40pm. \nRashid al Kindi of Excellence Performance talks about the event \nSpeaking at a press meet at the Oman Olympic Committee (OOC) headquarters on Wednesday, Saada al Ismaili, the director of women's sports at the ministry, said, “This event is a first in more ways than one. It is the first time that a girls-only cross country championship is being held in Oman. Also, with Excellence Performance organising the whole event for us, such an experiment is a first for us and we are confident of making the event success.” \nSaada said, “We would like this event to be an annual affair and along with the expertise of Excellence Performance, we will try to make it an international event next year. We hope to get the recognition from the IAAF, the world athletics body.” \nRashid al Kindi, the executive director of Excellence Performance, said, “Though the standard distance of a cross country race is 6km, we shortened the course to 4km to encourage more participation among girls. We expect nearly 200 women to participate and we have decided to award cash prizes to the top ten finishers.” \nThe winner will take home RO300, while the runner-up will get RO200. The third-placed finisher will receive RO150. There will be medals for the top 200 participants in the fun race. \nKindi is expecting to draw in participants from government, private and international schools, colleges, Royal Navy of Oman and Royal Oman Police. “Any girl who is above 14 years of age can compete in the championship,” he said. \nKindi said that a host of sports activities have been planned by the women's department for the event, including beach handball, badminton and indoor swimming that would be held throughout the day at Millennium Hotel. \nSaada said the organisers have worked out a 'special package' with the hotel in Musannah and interested families can contact the sports ministry's women's department to register for the offer. \nRegistration can be done at the sports ministry, the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex and Millennium Hotel.
