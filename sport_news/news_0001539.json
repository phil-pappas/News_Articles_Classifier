The usually sure-handed S.J. Green had two go through his hands, including one in the end zone late in the third quarter.\n“I think everybody knows there were some plays left out on the field, myself included,” said the 15-year CFL veteran Glenn. “You’re not going to complete every pass or catch every ball, but when you’ve got an opportunity to make a play, you’ve just got to make it. But we’ll come back strong.”\nWith Winnipeg and B.C. also losing on the weekend, the Alouettes remain tied for the crossover spot in the West Division playoffs.\nA crowd of 23,058 at Percival Molson Stadium saw Glenn, acquired this week from Saskatchewan after starter Rakeem Cato was injured, throw three interceptions while only generating one touchdown, when he hit Stamps with a 16-yard toss with the game all but over.\nHe completed 26 of 44 passes for 226 yards. Mathews was good on 21 of 25 tosses for 241 yards and was not intercepted.\n“He saw the field well, we just didn’t make the plays,” Popp said of Glenn. “Our defence did a pretty nice job but then we started turning the ball over, or not capitalizing when we could.”\nLight snow fell through a first quarter in which the only scoring was a 15-yard Medlock field goal on Hamilton’s first possession. A Simoni Lawrence interception set up a 30-yard Medlock boot 3:28 into the second quarter.\nMike Daly blocked a Bede punt and Frederic Plesius recovered to give Hamilton the ball on the Montreal eight, setting up a three-yard TD strike to Sinkfield at 5:47 by Mathews.\nThe Alouettes picked up a safety in the last minute of the half after Winston Venable blocked a punt and John Bowman recovered.\nConsecutive Hamilton drives produced Medlock field goals to open the second half before Glenn led a 10-play drive capped by Bede’s 26-yard boot at 14:50.\nThe play of the game was a spectacular 44-yard catch by Hamilton’s Luke Tasker in the third quarter as he bent backward to haul in a Mathews pass.\nHamilton running back Michael Ford (lower body) and Lawrence (upper Body) left the game late in the first half, as did Montreal linebacker Kyries Hebert, who has a possible concussion, and defensive lineman Aaron Lavarias, who injured an ankle.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:58:15.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
