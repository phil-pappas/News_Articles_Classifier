The Timbers will host Sporting Kansas City in the first round of playoffs. Colorado (9-15-10) finished the season in last place in the Western Conference with 37 points. \nPortland opened the scoring in the fifth minute. After getting fouled 25 yards from goal, Nagbe dusted himself off and proceeded to bend a blistering free kick over the wall and past Colorado goalkeeper Zac MacMath for his fourth goal of the season. \nColorado tied it eight minutes later, when Dominique Badji's shot deflected off of defender Liam Ridgewell, wrong-footing goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey and looping into the net. It was the second goal of the season for Badji. \nThe Timbers regained the lead in the 33rd minute. Lucas Melano's cross from the right found Nagbe near the penalty spot, where the Portland forward ducked down to head a looping ball over MacMath and into the upper left corner of the goal. \nPortland added to the lead in the 63rd minute, thanks again, in part, to Nagbe. Some close, precise passes around the Colorado penalty area led to Nagbe finding Jorge Villafana on the left side of the box. The left fullback's rocket of a shot ricocheted off of Colorado defender Sean St. Ledger and into the net for Villafana's first goal of the season. \nFanendo Adi capped the scoring in the 88th minute, using his chest to knock in a blistering Dairon Asprilla cross from the right wing. It was Adi's team-leading 14th goal of the season. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:08:07.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
