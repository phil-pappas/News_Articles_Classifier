(AP) - An FBI agent says a former Jackson police officer Bryan Jones admitted to stealing money from suspected drug dealers before he was charged.\nJones' lawyer, though, argued in court Friday that Jones was entrapped by the FBI.\nJones, 44, pleaded not guilty Friday before a judge on a five-count indictment issued Oct. 6. He faces up to 45 years in prison and up to $1.25 million in fines.\nAlthough prosecutors asked the judge to jail Jones, he remains free on $10,000 bond.\nThe FBI accuses Jones of informing drug dealers of police activity and raiding their rivals. Investigators set up stings in June 2014 and April 2015, telling Jones someone was coming to buy drugs. The FBI says Jones seized $4,000 the first time and $5,000 the second time.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
