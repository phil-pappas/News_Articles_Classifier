But this time, Winnacunnet High School’s star junior passed the torch in Saturday’s final round. Quinn, the defending Division I champ, shot 80 on Saturday and settled for fourth overall. The individual title was taken by Bishop Guertin’s Tom Ethier, who entered the day six shots back but rallied to beat 2013 champion Brandon Gillis in a playoff hole for the championship. The only comeback Quinn needed on Thursday came after his triple bogey on the sixth hole. He made it his last mistake, coming back with a birdie on 7 and then surging with a score of 2-under on the back nine. On a day when top-seeded Bedford hoisted the championship plaque and No. 2 Exeter settled for a three-way tie for sixth, it was Quinn’s low-medalist round that stole the show. He stepped to the first tee box with a goal of playing from the top of the leaderboard and executed just that, finishing his round with a clenched fist on 18 when he saved par out of the sand. “I was just feeling it (on Thursday),” said Quinn, who held a two-shot lead over Nashua North star Gillis entering Saturday’s final round. “On the back I birdied 10 and 11, which kind of gave me a good kickstart, and I really didn’t make a mistake after that.” That sparkling round, coupled with Ryan Moskevich’s 82, helped the Warriors finish in a share for fourth in the state with Manchester Memorial with a team score of 421. Bedford paced the field at 400, followed by runner-up Bishop Guertin (402) and Keene (403). Exeter, on the heels of its 17-3 regular season, finished in a three-team logjam for sixth with a 422. Winnacunnet, the No. 5 seed, went 15-5 in the regular season, breaking 190 in three separate matches. “Obviously, with Ryan in the beginning, we had a really good chance every match,” Winnacunnet coach Chris Sargent said. “He basically averaged 36 (every nine holes). But we had three or four seniors step up big time. That made it really fun.” Moskevich finished up with a second-round 84 on Saturday. Winnacunnet’s other team scorers Thursday were Max Jenson (85), Wil Saunders (91) and Mike Fiacco (93). “Some ups and downs,” Moskevich said of Thursday’s round, “but overall I made my pars, took bogey, didn’t make a lot of doubles, took my medicine when I needed to.” The course got the better of several golfers with its tucked pins and slick greens. On the lawn behind the 18th green, the players talked about rounds it which they shot the ball well but just couldn’t finish with the putter. “It’s a good course,” said Exeter coach Bob Bailey, who grew up across the river and honed his own golf game at Hanover CC. “You’ve got to hit shots. You just can’t smash it and stuff like that.” Exeter’s Steven Schnobrich (80) and senior captain Rob Walmsley (83) made the cut and joined Quinn and Moskevich at Saturday’s final round. Schnobrich came back with an 84 and Walmsley shot 85. The Blue Hawks were disappointed that they weren’t able to hold their line with the state’s top three teams. The Warriors were pleased with another step forward, bettering their fifth-place finish from 2014. “The one thing I would say in one word is — balance,” Sargent said. “We had that one balanced score every match that was kind of a surprise. If two of them didn’t show up, two other guys would step up. It was just a lot of fun. I had a blast with them.” “I think it was easily our best season, in my three years at least,” Quinn said. “We won it once like 25 years ago or something, but I think it’s one of the best seasons Winnacunnet’s had in a long time.” By Ryan O’Leary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:11:57.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
