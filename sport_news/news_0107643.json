There were no slush funds, no vote-buying,\" said Niersbach, who had denied the Spiegel allegations already on Monday.\nNiersbach said he visited Beckenbauer at his Austrian residence on Tuesday and learned about the deal reached between him and Blatter.\nFIFA was ready to finance the organizers to the tune of 250 million Swiss francs (about 230 million euros at current rates) in return for a payment of 10 million Swiss francs, Niersbach said.\nBeckenbauer was ready to use his personal funds to secure the grant but was told by his advisers not to do so and the money was finally given to FIFA's financial committee by French businessman Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who was boss of the Adidas sporting goods company at the time, according to Niersbach.\nThe German World Cup organizing committee later paid the money back, though FIFA, Niersbach said.\nCONNECT Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
