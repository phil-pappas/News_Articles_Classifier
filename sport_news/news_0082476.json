The convincing victory at House Park not only snapped LBJ’s three-game losing streak against McCallum, but it left the Jaguars and a Cedar Creek team that faces Lanier on Friday as the only teams without a loss in 26-5A play.\nLBJ’s three district victories have come against Bastrop (24-19), Reagan (32-7) and McCallum, teams that joined LBJ in the 2014 postseason.\nDeborah Cannon LBJ quarterback Deandre Wytaske races up the field against the McCallum defense on Thursday night. Wytaske scored touchdowns on runs of 89 and 51 yards as the Jaguars posted a 27-6 victory in the District 26-5A matchup. “It sends a big message,” LBJ junior linebacker Chris Sanders said of the three district victories. “It shows we’re out here and that we want to go to the playoffs and we’re here to win district.”\nLBJ (4-2) made a stand at its 13 during the game’s first possession, but the Jaguars proceeded to go backward on their first hand-off. LBJ kept the football in the hands of Wytaske on its next play, and the senior quarterback meandered through the McCallum defense on an 89-yard touchdown run.\nThe touchdown was the 31st since the start of the 2014 season for Wytaske, who took over quarterbacking duties at LBJ this season. Three of those touchdowns came on special teams, but the 89-yard jaunt was Wystaske’s seventh score that exceeded 50 yards. Only a 94-yard run against Connally in 2014 was longer.\nDeborah Cannon LBJ’s Ashton Williams sacks McCallum’s Tyler Page on Thursday night. The Knights didn’t score until the game’s final minutes as LBJ won 27-6. “Gotta make big plays when the time comes,” said Wytaske, who had a game-high 166 rushing yards.\nLBJ needed only Wytaske’s 89-yard score, but he added a 51-yard TD run in the third quarter. Wytaske’s long runs sandwiched 7- and 21-yard scores by Thomas.\nThe Jaguars’ offensive effort was matched by a LBJ defense that has allowed only 32 points in district play. LBJ gave up 57 yards on McCallum’s opening drive, but the Knights were limited to 101 yards after that possession. A defense led by Tulsa-bound defensive lineman Johnnie Williams stopped McCallum on two fourth-down attempts inside the red zone, and the Jaguars met the Knights at or behind the line of scrimmage on 21 plays.\nMcCallum vs. LBJ 10.08.15 McCallum did not score until there was 3:18 to go in the game.\n“Once we started adjusting, we mixed in a little blitz here and there and it just started working for us,” Thomas said.\nPlaying without injured running back Jorian Hardeway, McCallum (3-3, 2-1) posted its only points when sophomore Alexander Julian caught a 13-yard pass from Max Perez in the final quarter. McCallum, which last missed the postseason in 2001, will attempt to rebound at Bastrop on Oct. 16.\n“We’re just trying to piece some things together (offensively),” said McCallum coach Charles Taylor. “It was a little bit of us shooting ourselves in the foot, but it was a little bit of them. It’s hard to beat a school as talented as that every year, and we beat them three years straight until this year.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/08/84/1a/dyc-mccallum-lbj-19.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/275/img/photos/2015/10/08/c6/03/dyc_mccallum_lbj_01.JPG", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/08/f2/c1/dyc-mccallum-lbj-11.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:22:53.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
