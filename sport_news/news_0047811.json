(AP) â€” A southeastern Massachusetts mother says the school superintendent barged into her home to find out if her daughter met residency requirements.\nMarilyn King, whose daughter is enrolled at Mashpee High School, tells the Cape Cod Times that Brian Hyde arrived at their home unannounced on Tuesday.\n King says Hyde charged upstairs to verify that her 17-year-old daughter actually lived there. A lawyer for the family says he angrily demanded to know where the girl slept and opened dresser drawers to see if her clothes were inside.\nPolice are investigating trespassing allegations after the Kings filed a complaint Wednesday.\nHyde says he was following the school residency policy. He says there was no bed in the room and it did not appear to be occupied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:50:55.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
