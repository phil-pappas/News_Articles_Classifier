Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., wrote a letter urging them to name a ship after Williams.\nWilliams says that the ship in question will be an expeditionary sea base. U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus called Williams Tuesday morning to tell him the news.\nWilliams was born in 1923 near Fairmont, W.Va. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1923 and was assigned to the 3rd Marine Division. He earned the Medal of Honor in 1945 for his actions in the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as a Purple Heart.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
