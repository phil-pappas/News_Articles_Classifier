But there was no way he could have avoided being lambasted on television and social media. \nFormer Scotland skipper Gavin Hastings let fly at the South African official in interviews. \n“If I see referee Craig Joubert again, I am going to tell him how disgusted I am. It was disgraceful that he ran straight off the pitch at the end like that,” said the former British Lion. \n“The referee is not expected to make the right decision all the time. That’s what the TMO (Television Match Official) system is in place for. This is the quarter-final of a Rugby World Cup. This is the highest end of our sport and they have to get these decisions right.” \nAs former England scrum-half Matt Dawson, doing pundit work for the BBC, tweeted: “Craig Joubert you are a disgrace and should never referee again!! How dare you sprint off the pitch after that decision!!!” Likewise, former Scotland scrum-half Andy Nicol was outraged. “Never seen a ref do that ever! Knew he had made a shocking call. Feckin coward!!” he tweeted. \nJoubert was already in the bad books of Scotland fans after an apparently harsh yellow card early in the second-half for Sean Maitland, based on TMO evidence. \nMeanwhile, the Internet has already begun to carry out its revenge on the perceived injustice of Joubert’s conduct. There is a petition already doing the rounds to ban Joubert from ever entering Scotland, and another calling for him to be banned for life. \nAnd, of course, Joubert’s Wikipedia page has been on the receiving end of some Scottish embellishment. \n“Craig Paul Joubert (born 8 November 1977) is a South African professional rugby union referee who hates the Scotland National Rugby Union. He has officiated at international level since 2003 with the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final being his most high-profile match”, it read for a while. \nThe line “who hates the Scotland National Rugby Union” has since been removed.
