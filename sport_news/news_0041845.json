We need every game we can get,” said Altamirano. “We’re still upbeat. We want to stay positive. There’s no point dwelling in the past.”\nThey hope to use the Red Warriors, losers of the past four games, as an instrument in their quest to begin another winning run.\nNU is also out to avenge its 76-71 loss to UE in the first round when rookie transferee Bonbon Batiller came through with big baskets.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:45:56.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
