I was really pleased. The back four and the goalkeeper are jumping up and down about another clean sheet but I was more pleased with the quality going forward. \n\"We also thought we should have had a penalty and we had a couple of headers as well. The quality of our play going forward was very, very good at times.\" \nThe defeat for Norwich comes after losses to Leicester and Newcastle, who beat Alex Neil's side 6-2 at St James' Park last weekend. \nThe Canaries boss reacted by dropping his two full-backs for the visit of West Brom but that did not stop his side again emerging with nothing, and it is a run of form that the former Hamilton player-manager has never previously had to deal with in his short managerial career. \n\"I wouldn't say it is worrying times,\" he said. \n\"It is not a nice time, I have never even lost two league games in a row, never mind three. \n\"Yes, you are concerned, I'm looking at what I can do to put it right. I'm trying to do everything I can and I'm working as hard as I can and it is about making sure when the lads are on the pitch they do as well as they can.\" \nNorwich were on top for much of the opening 20 minutes but could not make their dominance pay, something Neil pointed to in his post-match analysis of the contest. \n\"The bottom line is, the game for us boils down to two boxes,\" he added. \n\"Our box, we didn't defend well enough and in the other box they defended it well. \n\"That is basically the game - we must have put about 40 crosses into their box and they put about seven into mine and scored a header and should have scored another. \n\"I thought our intensity dropped a little as the half wore on. To try to maintain that for a full half is difficult but at this level when you have the ball in good areas it is about punishing teams, and we didn't do that and there is always a danger they will threaten. \n\"In the second half we didn't stop a cross coming into our box and when it did we didn't defend the header and conceded the goal.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:22:02.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
