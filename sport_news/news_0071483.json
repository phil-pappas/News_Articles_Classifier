Multiple player arrests and suspensions will be put aside when the Rams host Delaware for a noon kickoff at Meade Stadium, with their quest for a first win of the season taking center stage. URI dropped its fifth straight Governor’s Cup matchup with Brown last weekend in a 41-31 thriller, squandering a pair of second-half leads and dropping to 5-39 in their last 44 games. The Rams wasted a career effort from sophomore running back Harold Cooper, who totaled 305 all-purpose yards and took home Colonial Athletic Association Special Teams Player of the Week honors courtesy of his 92-yard kickoff return for a score in the second half. “We had a lot of young guys out there step up and make some monstrous plays,” URI coach Jim Fleming said. “We competed well into the fourth quarter. We were just unable to get over the hump and get the first victory.” An inability to stop the Bears’ passing game proved to be URI’s undoing. Marcus Fuller threw for 438 yards and four touchdowns, helping Brown go 9-for-19 on third down and a near-perfect 4-for-5 on fourth down. The Rams’ defense was stuck on the Brown Stadium field for an even 100 snaps and surrendered 559 total yards. “We had plenty of opportunities,” Fleming said. “We had three or four missed (interception) opportunities on the go-ahead drives.” The Rams benefited from a 23-yard fumble return by Adam Parker and a Brown special-teams mistake to set up Cooper’s 3-yard touchdown run in the first half, turning what could have been a wide margin into a tight 20-14 game at the break. URI battled to the finish from there, ultimately falling short when Justin Rohrwasser’s potential tying 47-yard field-goal attempt with 3:19 to play missed wide left. Jordan Ferguson’s 34-yard interception return for a score barely a minute later sealed the Bears’ win. “From an overall perspective I think we’ve made improvement,” Fleming said. “Unfortunately, week in and week out, there have been different emphasis areas that have come up to bite us in the tail and prevented us from winning.” Delaware (2-3 overall, 1-1 CAA) presents an entirely different challenge, preferring to do the bulk of its work on the ground. Thomas Jefferson and Kareem Williams combined for 280 rushing yards in a 24-23 win over No. 25 William & Mary on Saturday, with Frank Raggo’s 29-yard field goal as time expired completing the Blue Hens’ comeback from a nine-point fourth-quarter deficit. “They’re a great challenge for us,” Fleming said. “Wouldn’t be a difference if it was Delaware or the New York Giants — every game is a big challenge for us. We’ll get prepared and we’ll get ready.” Page 2 of 2 - At least five URI players will be sidelined following an on-campus incident early Sunday morning. Offensive lineman Michael LeBlanc and defensive lineman Barrett Lyons have been dismissed from the team following their arrests on charges of simple assault and disorderly conduct in connection with a fight at the Chi Phi fraternity house. Freshman defensive lineman Nate Pauls has been suspended indefinitely and four other players whose names have not been released by the school will also be looking on, as a campus police investigation continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:13:37.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
