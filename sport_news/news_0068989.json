The Rifles' record in those 33 games is 1-31-1, including 0-5 in PFC semifinal games like the one that will be played Sunday. \nWinnipeg's only win was in Saskatoon on Aug. 28, 2005. The teams tied in Winnipeg on Aug. 12, 2007. Other than that the Rifles have lost 31 games by an average score of 38-16. \nThis year the Hilltops, who finished first with a 7-1 record, beat the Rifles 65-9 in Saskatoon and 50-8 in Winnipeg. In other words, the Rifles might need a few breaks to go their way at Saskatoon Minor Football Field. \nRifles rookie head coach Jason Park probably doesn't need to remind his players that the Hilltops have dominated the Rifles and won seven Canadian Junior Football League titles, including last year's, since 2002. \n“We never really talk about it much. I'm sure they do know,” Park said Saturday afternoon as the team bus rumbled towards Saskatoon. “We're just here on a business trip. It's just another team in our way.” \nThe Rifles won their final three games of the regular season to finish fourth with a 4-4 record, and they are relatively healthy going into the semifinal. Braedy Will, Michael Penner and Josh Onyebuchi are all back at full strength, as are starting quarterback Jamie Ybarra and their collection of running backs. \n“It's huge,” Park said. “We've got a lot of our leaders back and they're healthy, and we have a lot of our athletes who can make a difference back in the lineup now. Saskatoon hasn't seen some of these guys, so they don't know what to expect now.” \nPark said they're trying not to focus on just how big of an upset it would be if the Rifles were somehow able to emerge victorious. \n“Obviously football people know what it would be,” he said. “We're not really concentrating on that. We're there looking at it as another opponent. If and when we win, it will be huge for our football program.” \nkirk.penton@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:36:44.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
