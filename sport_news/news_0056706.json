And that extends beyond the football field. The Saints ' linebackers coach chased two people who were trying to steal his car Saturday morning and ended up tearing his Achilles tendon and breaking his wrist in the process, a team spokesman told ESPN.com .\nBut because Joe Vitt is Joe Vitt, he didn't miss a day of work.\nMore details of the thwarted crime:\nThe incident occurred shortly before 4 a.m. on Saturday, according to Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman Col. John Fortunato. Vitt was walking through his kitchen when he noticed a shadow running across his front lawn. When he went outside to investigate, he noticed a white female with blonde hair wearing khaki shorts and gloves attempting to enter a neighbor's vehicle. Vitt then looked toward his own car and saw a white male inside the vehicle.\n\nWhen they saw Vitt, they took off running, according to Fortunato. Vitt pursued them on foot for a short distance before tripping and causing injuries that required a trip to the hospital. The suspects remain at large. Vitt began his coaching career with the Colts and has been with the Saints since 2006. He served as interim coach in New Orleans during the 2012 season when coach Sean Payton was suspended for his role in the bounty scandal. When not coaching NFL players, Joe Vitt is also a crime fighter.
