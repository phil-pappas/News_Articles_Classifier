The Government college for women is said to have already attracted a decent number of women scholars, both Indian and Anglo-Indian. There are also several Brahman students in it. But higher education has not yet been recognised as a suitable ideal to be followed by Madras women. As yet only a very few young women have taken a fancy to it and the college is also in an experimental stage. It may become more popular in future or more unpopular under the increasing stringency and rigour of university regulations. No man can definitely say yet that Indian women have displayed a decided taste for university education. Under these circumstances the starting of a private college as a rival in the same place as the Government seems place as the Government College seems to us to be a waste of energy and a mistake. If, however, the Christian College for women is started in any other centre, it would probably do good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:37:48.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
