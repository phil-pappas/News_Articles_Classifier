Clay Matthews sacks Colin KaepernickClay Matthews does the Kap bicep kiss dance. #GBvsSF http://t.co/QvRDBgAXFu \nMatthews is also being credited with this classic diss of Kaepernick, picked up by the TV microphone after the quarterback lost a yard after holding onto the ball on a read-option play. “You ain’t Russell Wilson!”Packers players sound off on Colin Kaepernick. #GBvsSF http://t.co/WFZcDZBf05 — NFL (@NFL) October 5, 2015 \nIn case you couldn't quite hear it, the line was, \"You ain't Russell Wilson, bro,\" a reference to the Seattle Seahawks quarterback who has had tremendous success running that play. \nMatthews was asked about the biceps kiss after the game. \"It’s just having fun,\" he said. \"We’re a bunch of kids out there running around and having fun at each other’s expense.” \nPretty sure Kaepernick isn't laughing. Just a few years removed from a Super Bowl appearance, the 49ers are 1-3 with Kaepernick having thrown five interceptions to just two touchdown passes. He's also been sacked 14 times already, on pace for a career-high 56 times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:12:00.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
