Like, we didn't need a ton of reasons to be excited about hockey this year but JAGR'S MULLET IS BACK!!! Gosh it's so exciting. This is a challenge to you, people of Florida. The Panthers have had terrible attendance for a while. Now you have the option to see JAGR MULLET live and in-person. It's a privilege most of us would kill for. Do not squander it.\nIn case you need more convincing we have an artist's interpretation of how awesome it will be.\n© Provided by SB Nation Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://t.co/hkMhbG7b40", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlaPanthers?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/68Jagr", "https://twitter.com/GeorgeRichards/status/651088035040378880", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:49:38.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
