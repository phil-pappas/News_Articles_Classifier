Kasuri, whose book “Neither A Hawk, Nor A Dove” has hit the stands in India, remained the foreign minister of Pakistan from 2002 to 2007 during President Pervez Musharraf’s regime and was considered one of main architects of the Indo-Pak peace process. He was here to deliver a talk on “Strengthening relationship between India and Pakistan” at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID). The event was presided over by Harish Khare, Editor-in-Chief of the Tribune Group of Newspapers. Prof RP Bambah, Rachpal Malhotra and Kuldip Kaur, Senior Vice-Chairman, Executive Vice-Chairman and Director General of CRRID, respectively, were also present. Kasuri said it was a matter of grave concern that history was not being taught properly both in Pakistan and India. “It was due to this reason that I decided to refer to Ashoka and Chandragupta Maurya in my account. Punjab produced two great heroes, Maharaja Ranjit Singh and King Porus, who did a lot for their motherland. But, it was not taught in the right perspective as part of history in Pakistan. In a way, we have murdered history. “Similarly, Mahatma Gandhi’s fast played a crucial role in our side getting our assets. But, that is also somehow missing in history teachings there. I have tried to reflect everything about the India-Pakistan relationship truthfully and it could be the reason why there will be certain things that will be unliked by both—Indians and Pakistanis,” Kasuri said. Kasuri negated the possibility of any war between the two countries. “If you (Pakistan and India) cannot fight a war then what is the logic behind border skirmishes? No country of this region can afford a war due to the presence of nuclear arms. There is always a way to solve tangles. The best solution is not to let the dialogue process get derailed by the negative forces that do not want to see lasting peace on both sides,” he said. The best solution to ease strained relations between the two countries was to encourage people-to-people contact besides boosting trade and cultural exchanges. “We should have a vision. Let there be open borders like the countries of European Union,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:10:30.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
