That's what we're aiming to do this week, and we're going to try to put an even better game together. \n\"I haven't looked back on all the games, but it was definitely a good game. We played a Hall of Fame quarterback. We played a team that was undefeated, and we went blow-to-blow with them, and we had a shot at the end of the game to win, but unfortunately, we didn't, so it's back to practice to clean up the mistakes and get better and do what we came here to do.\" \nDespite forcing three interceptions, the Browns gave up 290 yards and one touchdown, a 75-yard score, to multi-time Pro Bowl quarterback Peyton Manning, who engineered a 72-yard game-winning drive in overtime. \n\"We played a tough game,\" Mingo said. \"They played a tough game. They just, at the end of the day, made more plays than we made. We have to go back and practice, clean up those mistakes and make sure we make those tough plays to finish games in the future. \n\"I wouldn't say we haven't played well. We've put some solid games together, and in our individual rooms, we graded plus and minus every play, and the goal is to fill up every grade sheet with positives and guys are doing that. \n\"We're not going out and playing high school teams. We're playing pro teams that can make plays. We're playing guys that it's their job to move the ball, just like it's our job to stop them, and unfortunately, somebody has to come up on the short end of the play, but our guys are doing their jobs. We're doing our jobs and we're making plays. Sometimes, somebody makes one more play.\" \nThe Broncos rushed for 152 yards on 33 carries and averaged 4.6 yards per rush against a Browns defense that entered the game ranked 31st out of 32 teams after giving up an average of 149.4 yards over the first five games of the regular season. \nAnd in order to improve on defending the run, especially heading into Sunday's game against a St. Louis Rams team that has averaged 119 rushing yards per game and 4.8 yards per rush, Mingo knows the Browns have to \"stop the run, stop the run, stop the run.\" \n\"The guys know that we put a solid game together,\" Mingo said. \"Unfortunately, we didn't come out on the winning side, but it's definitely something to build on, and it's definitely something we can move forward and say, 'Well, we can play this way. We can play that way.' I don't think there's anybody here that's hanging their head. \n\"You go back on the practice field and you work. Like I said, you pound it in the film room. You go out on the field and you execute those techniques, put a solid game plan together from the coaches and then, it's up to us on Sundays to execute. \n\"You tackle. You block release. You've got guys coming down, fixing anything that leaks out. That's football. You just tackle. If you see the guy with the ball and he comes in your gap, you hit him, you tackle him, you get off the field. \" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RWhoiN TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:12:32.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
