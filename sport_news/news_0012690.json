Beckham is officially listed as questionable for the contest.\nMORE : With Odell Beckham Jr. expected to play, how can Eagles stop Giants' top playmaker?\nIt's a huge boost for the Giants, who are already without wide receiver Victor Cruz. Rueben Randle is also dealing with a hamstring injury but is expected to play. He's listed as probable.\nBeckham injured his hamstring in the second half of last Sunday's 30-27 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. He missed most of the fourth quarter, but put himself back in the contest for part of the game-winning drive. He forced a crucial pass interference call to set up the game-winning touchdown by tight end Larry Donnell with 21 seconds remaining.\nRELATED : The full Giants injury report Treatment on his hamstring began immediately after the game. Beckham underwent an MRI last Monday and had some swelling in the area. He remained optimistic throughout the week and worked tirelessly to be ready for the key divisional matchup, which is for first place in the NFC East. \"Treatments, treatments, treatment,\" Beckham said of his plan to get healthy during the week. \"Just make sure you stay on top of it all.

He missed some time this spring with a hamstring strain.\nThe Giants need to be careful with last year's Offensive Rookie of the Year. He's a key part of their offense and they can't afford for this to blossom into something bigger, especially given the current state of their decimated roster.\nBeckham, 22, is the Giants leading receiver. He has 31 catches for 428 yards and three touchdowns this season.\n(Giants' beat writer Jordan Raanan contributed to this story)\nMark Eckel may be reached at mjeck04@verizon.net .
