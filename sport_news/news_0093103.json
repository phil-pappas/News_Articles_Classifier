Pen Argyl’s players, to a man, said they drew critical inspiration from the big crowd at Alumni Stadium. “All these people came out to show who proud they are of Pen Argyl,” senior quarterback Jake Holden said. “We had to be excited.” Green Knight sophomore running back Logan Sterne r said the team’s fast start – Pen Argyl led 12-0 after the first quarter – allowed the team to draw energy and excitement from the stands. Home field may not always matter in high school football, but it sure did Saturday. \nJake Holden stepping up. Pen Argyl’s senior quarterback, who did not play at all last season and didn’t start this season as the signal caller, showed he’s getting more and more comfortable in his new role. He played with confidence, threw a 54-yard touchdown pass to junior tight end Joey DePaolo , and ran twice for 29 yards. One of those runs was an eight-yard quarterback sneak, as Holden dragged Wilson tacklers en masse, to convert a 4th-and-1 on Pen Argyl’s first drive that ended in a touchdown. His other run converted a 3rd-and-15 situation and led to another touchdown. “In the beginning of the year, I was a little bit nervous out there but things are going better now,” Holden said. \nTwo-way debut good for Guerro . Pen Argyl head coach Paul Reduzzi noted that Saturday was a big day for senior wide receiver and defensive back Nick Guerro . “This was the first time he started both ways in a game,” Reduzzi said. “He had been starting on defense but not on offense, and he stepped up nicely.” Guerro had a key interception in the end zone to deny a promising Wilson drive. \nNo Salisbury re-run. Reduzzi had watched his team take a two-touchdown lead at home against Salisbury on Oct. 3 and wind up losing 35-14. Saturday, Pen Argyl led 12-0, then trailed 13-12, but didn’t go down the same path. “We saw the kids respond the way we wanted them to today,” he said. “Salisbury, we didn’t respond, and this was the same situation on the same field today. And they responded. We came out and played really well in the second half.” \nNo longer down and out. It was only natural for Pen Argyl to feel a bit blue after two straight losses to Saucon Valley and Notre Dame by a combined 109-6 over the last two weeks. “We were down a little bit,” Holden said. “But we didn’t hang our heads and we kept working hard in practice this week. We couldn’t let those losses affect us going into this game. And now we have our first win, and that’s huge. It will make practice a lot more fun this week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:16:16.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
