I had a lot of the Alabama guys hate me. It was fun.” One of those Alabama guys was Dabo Swinney, whom Young met in the fourth grade in their Pelham, Ala. neighborhood. The pair would go on to walk on to the Alabama football team together. Young never got on the field between 1989-90 –“it was Rudy with a bad ending,” Young said – but Swinney went on to coach for the Crimson Tide staff, and today leads No. 12-ranked Clemson into its first meeting with Notre Dame in 36 years. Which circles back to Young, who today lives in Chattanooga, Tenn. where he’s worked for 23 years in business solutions for Coca-Cola, recently married his new bride, Connie and has switched his primary allegiance to Alabama. But Young still pulls for his Fighting Irish, since he lived in Indiana until he was six and his father insisted they root for Notre Dame. That rubbed off on Young’s childhood chum. “Keith was the biggest Notre Dame fan you’ve ever met in your life, so I learned a lot about them,” Swinney said at his Tuesday press conference. “I learned to not like Notre Dame because Alabama was always a great program under Coach (Bear) Bryant, and Notre Dame was a great program back in the ‘70s. Four horsemen and Knute Rockne and Win one for the Gipper and all that stuff, that’s what I grew up on.” Although a nephew’s wedding will force Young to record both the Georgia-Alabama and Notre Dame-Clemson games on television Saturday to watch later, Young will attempt a rarity: rooting against the Fighting Irish. “It’s surreal to see Dabo on TV and to see the fan support,” Young said. “He’s such a fantastic person, all the way from fourth grade on.” Rain, rain, go away Hurricane Joaquin is slowly descending on the eastern coast of the United States, and local weather forecasts indicate a probable chance of driving rain slamming Clemson during the day Saturday. Swinney doesn’t plan on altering the gameplan, clear skies or not. “We’ve played in a couple monsoons. They got the same weather we got. So I don’t worry about that, I can’t control that,” Swinney said Wednesday evening, adding he “never even asks about the weather” in the locker room before kickoff, “because it just doesn’t matter.” Split kicks Redshirt freshman Greg Huegel, 4-of-5 on field-goal tries this year, will retain his placekicking duties Saturday vs. Notre Dame. But senior Ammon Lakip, the team’s leading scorer last year, will handle kickoffs after serving his three-game suspension for an offseason cocaine possession arrest. “I think that takes a little pressure off of Greg,” Swinney said. “As far as the field goals, we’ll keep on rolling (with Huegel.) Hopefully he’ll keep performing. But if not, we feel good about Ammon.” The Tigers rank 120th in opponents’ kickoff return average, allowing a 100-yard touchdown to Louisville’s Traveon Samuel. Injury report Senior center Ryan Norton remains out with a knee injury; while Swinney is “encouraged” by his rehabilitation, he anticipated it’s likely Norton will be out at least until the team’s Oct. 17 game against Boston College. Swinney had no further updates on junior receiver Mike Williams, who suffered a small fracture in his neck making a touchdown catch in the Sept. 5 opener vs. Wofford. The initial prognosis was Williams would be out until mid-October, minimum. “That’s just all on how he heals,” Swinney said. “If he’s back, that’d be gravy. But I don’t have any expectation for Mike Williams.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T14:56:03.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
