This is just lazy writing on Kiper’s part. Towles looks like an NFL QB, but has none of the skills. Actually, it probably isn’t lazy writing on Kiper’s part. He is a TERRIBLE judge of NFL talent based on his mock drafts. \nTowles is no Woodson. And Woodson couldn’t even make it in the NFL. That’s not a disparaging remark towards Andre. Not many QBs CAN make it in the NFL. gobgblu37 October 8, 2015 at 11:46 am | Permalink \nESPN considers him to be a fair judge of talent. I don’t think they pay him to guess on recruits!

Bluecreeker October 8, 2015 at 12:08 pm | Permalink | Reply \nDelk, I would be willing to take that bet. \nPatrick Towles has every physical attribute need to be a successful NFL QB if he continues to improve mentally. \nMuch of what you see as weakness has a lot to do with the offense they are trying to run. Let’s just say the 4th quarter of last weeks game is what the offense SHOULD look like. I saw a difference, did you? KT October 8, 2015 at 12:20 pm | Permalink | Reply \nBackup qb always popular. Towles is kind of becoming our football version of Andrew Harrison. He’s awesome but some people will never like him for whatever reason. He should be our starting qb. Barker would be getting reps if this team could win by more than one score but that’s not their style. We are a young talented team that can beat anyone on the schedule or lose as well(even to Charlotte). There will be a LOT of close games because offense is young and defense has overacheived to this point. Stay patient, we all see progress though. Still say 7-5 this year but defensive effort makes me believe we could sneak another win or 2 in there if we play well. Consistency on offense will continue to improve last half of season. I just hope our line stays healthy. CatsfaninFL October 8, 2015 at 1:14 pm | Permalink \nInjuries too. We’ve steered clear of them but with us being young any key player injury could seriously put us in trouble. Agree that 7-5 is quite doable…. Charlotte, Louisville, and Vandy (although Vandy at Vandy w/ that defense will not be the cake walk everyone is assuming) are our best shots for that but certainly not out of the realm to add in UT or Auburn given how they are playing. \nI also think with each win we have to be better at not letting it get to the young guys heads… every week will be a dogfight (as our 5 games decided by <9 has shown). jman3715 October 8, 2015 at 12:24 pm | Permalink | Reply \nNot sure about Towles but that dude’s hair is epic!

DesignatedDrinker October 8, 2015 at 3:58 pm | Permalink \nPeople who dislike Towles have been purposefully misspelling it. It is juvenile and if these are the type of people who disapprove of him being the QB, then he definitely should be. But getting Barker a drive in the first half here and there through 5 games you would think would’ve been planned no matter the score. Towles starting and Barker getting some reps are what’s best for the program. Shannon Dawson leaving is also what’s best for the program. Nothing creative, nothing unpredictable. Should be 5-0, but ecstatic about 4-1.

RockyMountainWildcat October 8, 2015 at 3:28 pm | Permalink \nI’m confused. If you’re implying that Towles is the starter bc he’s an in state kid (like Willis), that point is kind of null and void, since Barker is also from Kentucky. Not trying to be obnoxious about it, you might be making a perfectly valid point, I just don’t know what it might be. Care to clarify a bit? JT October 8, 2015 at 3:49 pm | Permalink \nI think what the DW is implying, is Barker is better than Towles and should be playing. Its no secret that Patrick family donates a lot of money to the university and has a lot of influence. Plus you throw in Stoops who is still pissed off at Barker for off field stuff and that’s why patrck is playing.

Dieter October 8, 2015 at 4:33 pm | Permalink | Reply \nYes, Stoops must be playing the inferior QB because his parents donate money, as opposed to the assuredly better, completely untested and unknown backup QB! It makes perfect sense, after all, for Stoops to jeopardize his job by knowingly electing to play the inferior player for a few Booster dollars… In Cal’s words, “you people are crazy.” If Towles is playing, it’s because he honestly believes their best chance to win is with him. He’s the professional. We are not. Dieter October 8, 2015 at 4:37 pm | Permalink \n“he” being Stoops and “him” being Towles.

If it gets to the point where we may not make a bowl, then you can start calling for Towles head, but until then how about you all actually give him some support.

Andy October 8, 2015 at 9:43 pm | Permalink | Reply \nDoes Towles have the physical tools to be a NFL QB- Yes but so did Josh Freeman. There are other aspects such as the mental aspect, accuracy and being able to read defenses. That’s what separates great QBS from back ups. Time will tell if he can be consistent in those areas. Until then the Jury is out. MattInTN October 9, 2015 at 4:44 am | Permalink | Reply \nYou all are all absolutely insane. We’re 4-1!! Let me repeat, 4-1, 4-1, 4-1, 4-1. You seriously want to make a quarterback change when the only game we have lost is to a team that is much better than everyone predicted?? Get off Patrick’s back. The guy loves this program as much as any one of us reading this blog, and he’s playing good football. Anybody who things the backup that has NEVER TAKEN A COLLEGE SNAP is going to be better is completely off their rocker. If you would have told me Matt Roark would be our QB all year and we’d start 4-1, I’m taking it every single time! Just take a step back and look how far this program has come. Patrick is a guy that we can all get behind. He’s a Kentucky kid that bleeds blue and wants this program to be the best that it can be. We’re trying to make it to bowl games not win national titles. QB’S sit for 2-3 years at every major program. Drew will have his time and be great here, but Patrick is our guy right now and if you can’t get behind him then start cheering for that red team down the road!
