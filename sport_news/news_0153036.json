Women’s magazines described rompers in terms befitting maritime exploration – a high risk, high reward endeavour into uncharted waters. Friends would lean in close and ask in hushed terms “But how do you go to the bathroom?”\nBut slowly, season by season, jumpsuits started crawling out into the open. It began with teenage girls buying little playsuits and rompers, often in Liberty prints, held up with spaghetti straps. First from vintage shops, then on the high street. These garments are now festival classics, worn best with wellingtons and battered straw hats.\nRelated: Jumpsuits: 10 of the best – in pictures\nFashion people started wearing jumpsuits to formal functions, and celebrities followed suit . In Australia, Jessica Gomes has taken to the style, wearing Bec and Bridge jumpsuits on more than one occasion . Meanwhile, Lover’s take attracted international attention.\nThen grown women discovered more casual shirtdress jumpsuits, which work best when they recall Yves Saint Laurent’s safari jackets, with big pocket detailing at the bust and hips, to help define the body.\nFrom there, ‘How do you go to the bathroom’ stopped being a question and became a running joke. Sitting mostly naked on a public toilet was a cheerful shared aspect of life in a jumpsuit.\nThat jumpsuits are no longer quite so exotic is good news for everyone. Informal playsuits are the perfect piece of clothing for spring – they work at picnics, on weekend excursions and even in the office. Now they’re not ‘risky’ or ‘daring’ – there are plenty of options around.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fashion stylist Lina Matluma wearing a vintage jumpsuit during London Fashion Week spring/summer 2016/17.

You can simply throw them on and go. They also have the same stretching effect as dresses. If it fits you properly, a full length jumpsuit can make you look several inches taller and a little bit slimmer than you actually are. But, like trousers, jumpsuits have that louche kind of cool. You can sit with your legs spread in them. You can climb fences (sort of). They look far more appropriate in an office environment than a maxidress, and are literally and figuratively cooler to wear than suits.\nIf you’ve been avoiding them up until now, the style to jump in with is something wide-legged. If you’re short and curvy, try a culotte leg that could pass for a little A-line dress, like this one by Adelyn Rae . A style with pinafore straps will be the easiest to alter, so the torso neither pulls, nor swamps your crotch. A long-sleeved style, with short bottoms, in a slightly heavier fabric, like this sell-out style from Cue , can also work.\nIf you’re taller or slimmer, a full-length or midi style looks especially fun. Swishy and kooky, they still have a feminine grace. Alpha60 has been making an excellent cut, the Rasia , for several seasons in different prints and fabrics.\nMeanwhile, Hanneli Mustaparta made an excellent case for lace inset overalls at Hamilton Island race week earlier this year. That piece, by Zimmermann, is now sold out everywhere, but the Australian sisters are prolific jumpsuit creators, so there are still several similar styles to choose from.\nIf you’re concerned jumpsuits are nearly done with their day in the sun, don’t be. They made several appearances at Milan’s spring/summer 2016 showings last week. Giorgio Armani’s looked like pretty silk mini dresses, while Max Mara paired a pinafore jumpsuit with a super skinny skivvy. Layering under a jumpsuit works well on crisper spring mornings. Borrowing this straight off the runway styling note has an extra advantage: when you wear a jumpsuit with a skivvy underneath, you don’t have to go totally nude in the toilette.", "external_links": ["http://www.alpha60.com.au/products/13075c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f208c959748b4f10f3a0e3b765a8483374fb35ec/78_183_1770_2658/master/1770.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=e0a77bd81e0575a4889ef10083c9967e", "http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/adelyn-rae-pleated-culotte-jumpsuit/3977079?origin=category-personalizedsort&contextualcategoryid=0&fashionColor=&resultback=4246", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/212513676139679678/", "https://www.cue.cc/Shop/Product/Slit-Sleeve-Jumpsuit-C20298-S15/271427", "http://www.styloko.com/womens-fashion/spotted-hayden-panettieres-lover-lace-top-jumpsuit/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f208c959748b4f10f3a0e3b765a8483374fb35ec/78_183_1770_2658/master/1770.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=7c03f4eda1b6dbf202cc5e15f8c52346", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f208c959748b4f10f3a0e3b765a8483374fb35ec/78_183_1770_2658/master/1770.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=68d784e38d6df74370c7af0666bd82ac", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Jumpsuits%3A+not+just+for+the+brave%2C+daring+or+those+willing+to+sit+mostly+naked+in+the+toilet&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffashion%2F2015%2Foct%2F02%2Fjumpsuits-no-longer-for-the-daring-brave-or-those-willing-to-sit-mostly-naked-on-the-toilet&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ff208c959748b4f10f3a0e3b765a8483374fb35ec%2F78_183_1770_2658%2F1770.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f208c959748b4f10f3a0e3b765a8483374fb35ec/78_183_1770_2658/master/1770.jpg?w=380&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=a6582a91ecb763b3f8795aaf7cecda98", "https://instagram.com/p/6g4usHwSaF/?taken-by=hannelim", "http://us.zimmermannwear.com/readytowear/clothing/jumpsuits-playsuits", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Jumpsuits%3A%20not%20just%20for%20the%20brave%2C%20daring%20or%20those%20willing%20to%20sit%20mostly%20naked%20in%20the%20toilet&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cqy2%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cqy2%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cqy2&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ff208c959748b4f10f3a0e3b765a8483374fb35ec%2F78_183_1770_2658%2F1770.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f208c959748b4f10f3a0e3b765a8483374fb35ec/78_183_1770_2658/master/1770.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=4ddcd59aaed8283032a366b8b95f99b2", "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/26/250F407C00000578-2926260-Smouldering_Jessica_Gomes_wears_sexy_sheer_jumpsuit_to_Heidi_Klu-a-1_1422249831541.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:29:33.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
