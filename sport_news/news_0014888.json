Even before he assumed office as president, he had identified three key goals for China--to qualify for another World Cup, to host a World Cup and to win a World Cup championship. He played soccer in high school and liked to watch soccer matches when he was serving as an official at government. Soccer has been part of his diplomacy, take a look at the many jerseys he received over the years from world leaders and friends...in 2012, when he was still vice president and visited Ireland...he showed his well-honed skill, last year in Germany, he cheered on the Chinese children who were being trained there...On the internet, there were cartoons of Mr.Xi playing soccer and they went viral. Xi said it is the unpredictable nature of the sport that attracts him. And his passion for soccer has won him lots of fans in the country. \nQ2, So what are new momentums in Chinese   now. Will X's football dream come true? \nJin: Well, so much is going on right now.The Chinese government announced this year a plan to reform the way the sport is governed and managed in China. Chinese leaders have grouped the revival of football with the dream to rejuvenate the Chinese nation. The plan involves almost all aspects. There will be greater focus on schools and facilities to encourage world class athletes at a young age...and there are even football textbooks rolled out for physical education classes in elementary and middle schools. There are also projects to send children to be trained abroad and also inviting world football stars to play in China. One key highlight is on separation of government and football associations. It's a dramatic shift of strategy now because China has always relied on a small handful of professionally trained footballers to win games, but now the nation wants to popularize the name, and start from the bottom up. Actually right before Xi's visit to the United Kingdom, he told Reuters News Agency that in the next five years, football training will be introduced to 20,000 Chinese schools.
