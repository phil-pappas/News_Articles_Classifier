They haven't had proper treatment in the prison,\" he told AFP, adding that holding them while the trial was ongoing was \"like punishing them in advance\".\nA New Zealand bar manager is also among the list of prisoners after he was jailed for two-and-a-half years in March for \"insulting religion\" by using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks night.\nSurging Buddhist nationalism and religious violence has sparked international concern in the country with fears growing over the abuse of religious sentiment in the current election campaign.
