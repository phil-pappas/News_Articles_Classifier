Sometimes the story they tell is hard to interpret, but here are a few from the first half of the college football season that caught our attention.\nThe nation's leader in all-purpose yardage probably isn't on many Heisman short lists, but maybe he should be. Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey's huge day against UCLA last week helped, of course, but there's more to his total average of 253 yards a game. His solid rushing numbers are augmented by the fact that he also shags kickoffs, averaging 30 yards on 16 returns. He hasn't brought one of those all the way back yet, but he's certainly a candidate to do so.\nAdChoices Baylor's Corey Coleman doesn't just lead the country in touchdown receptions. His 16 scores are the most touchdowns , period. A couple of other guys have found the end zone 14 times, including a fellow at LSU you might of heard of named Leonard Fournette, but Coleman and the Bears' offense don't show any signs of slowing down.\nHow much of a tackling beast is Missouri linebacker Kentrell Brothers? Through seven games, he has a total of 91 stops, 13 per outing. Of those, 42 — or six per game — are solos. No one else in the FBS is averaging more than 12 total tackles a game. Throw in a couple of blocked kicks along with those stops, and you have a guy that keeps opposing offensive coordinators awake at night.\nIt hasn't helped much in terms of wins, but Georgia Tech can at least take pride in being the least penalized team in the country. The Yellow Jackets have drawn only 21 flags, an average of three per game. No other FBS squad is averaging fewer than four fouls.\nPenn State and Michigan don't meet until Nov. 21, but one statistical category in particular doesn't bode well for the Nittany Lions. The Wolverines, despite last week's agonizing outcome against Michigan State, boast the nation's No.-1 third-down defense. Opponents have converted just 19-of-98 for 19.39%. The Penn State offense has a conversion rate of only 27-of-96 for 28.13%, the least efficient among power-five conferences.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/big12/2015/10/17/baylor-wr-corey-coleman-three-touchdowns-record-pace/74128292/", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/pac12/2015/10/16/christian-mccaffrey-and-stanford-run-through-ucla/74034614/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:01:45.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
