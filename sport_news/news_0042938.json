All deny wrongdoing. \nThe club itself was charged last year with tax fraud in the signing of Neymar from Brazilian club Santos and paid $18.6 million in what it called a \"complementary tax declaration\". \nThey said they remained \"convinced the original tax payment was in line with their fiscal obligations\". \nBarca's legal problems have come on top of a FIFA ban for breaking rules on the signing of minors and president Josep Maria Bartomeu complained last year of what he called a concerted campaign to damage the Spanish and European champions. \nHe was repeatedly asked who was behind the alleged campaign, including if it might be arch rivals Real Madrid, but he declined to provide any names. \n\"FC Barcelona condemns the accumulation of totally inadmissible and external decisions that have been going on for some time and that have nothing to with strictly sporting affairs,\" Barca said on Thursday. \n\"They are damaging to the smooth running of the club, its stability and that of the players that form part of it. \n\"The club shall be working with more determination than ever to defend its legitimate rights and is ready for any new challenges that might arise.\" \n($1 = 0.8829 euros)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:37:30.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
