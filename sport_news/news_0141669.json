After Corning took its first lead of the game with 6:50 left in the game on a 2-yard sneak by John Dobson, the Hawks defense needed to stop no less than four 2-point conversion tries by Vestal over the game’s final 2:17. Vestal tried to tie the score the first time after a TD with 2:17, but was turned back twice on 2-point tries. Following what appeared to be an insurance 47-yard touchdown by Corning’s Devon Sullivan with 1:58 to got, Vestal found the end zone again with 9.6 seconds left. This time, the Hawks were penalized on the first 2-point try, before forcing quarterback T.J. Wegmann to overthrow his receiver on the Golden Bears’ next try. Sullivan, who was held to just 22 yards on the ground in a first half, finished with 142 on the ground, including TD runs of 30 yards in the third quarter and 47 in the fourth as Corning outscored Vestal 21-12. The Hawks’ defense was in the spotlight in the first half, as Corning’s unit held as Vestal got to the Hawks’ 9-yard line on its opening drive, only to be held scoreless following a missed field goal attempt. The Golden Bears were more successful their next two possession – driving 54 yards in three plays as Wegmann ran away for a 42-yard scoring run in the first quarter. Following Corning’s second consecutive three-and-out, Vestal made the score 14-0 with an 11-play drive that ended with a 32-yard touchdown throw from Wegmann to Rusty Virkler on a 4th and 9 play – pushing the Golden Bears lead lead to 14-0. Corning got on the board with 55 seconds left in the half, by moving the ball 63 yards on 13 plays before Luke Trussell popped into the end zone with a six-yard run. Trussell finished with 39 yards rushing, while Jason Rodriguez closed the game with 60 yards on 10 totes. Wegmann led Vestal with 113 rushing yards and another 154 yards through the air. Corning kick Vitor Mourao was good on all four of his tries to help provide the final margin of victory.
