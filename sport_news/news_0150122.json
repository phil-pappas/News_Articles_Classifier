Coincidentally, here they are: \n1. Iowa has played in 20 other stadiums since its last game at Wisconsin, in 2009. Legends and Leaders. Never forget. \n2. Boise State (.972) is the only FBS team with a higher winning percentage at home than Wisconsin’s .910 (71-7) since the start of the 2004 season. \n3. The home team has lost six of the last eight games in this series. \n4. Iowa has lost its last nine games against ranked teams. \n5. Wisconsin has won its last nine trophy games. \n6. The Sagarin Ratings (of FBS and FCS teams) rank Wisconsin’s strength-of-schedule in games already played at 138th. And that includes a game against Alabama. \n7. Iowa is one of just two FBS teams that has yet to allow a rushing touchdown. Navy is the other. \n8. Wisconsin players have rushed for 100 yards in a game 36 times since the start of the 2013 season. That covers 31 games. \n9. Iowa is the only Big Ten team that hasn’t missed a field goal. \n10. The Hawkeyes have allowed just three first-quarter points this season. \n11. In Wisconsin’s 26-24 win at Iowa last year , Iowa quarterback Jake Rudock completed seven passes for 20 yards or more and had rushes of 21 and 11 yards ... in the second half alone. \n12. In Paul Chryst’s last 15 games at Camp Randall —12 as offensive coordinator and three as head coach — the Badgers have averaged 51.2 points per game. \n13. Chryst’s father, George Chryst, played on the 1958 Wisconsin team that was cost a Rose Bowl bid when it lost at Iowa, 20-9. The Hawkeyes won the Big Ten and went on to a 38-12 win over California in Pasadena. \n14. George Chryst went on to be the head football coach and athletic director at Wisconsin-Platteville. He hired current Badgers men’s basketball coach Bo Ryan to be his basketball coach at Platteville and Ryan won four NCAA Division III titles there. \n15. Iowa fullback Mason Plewa is from Franklin, Wis. Hawkeye quarterback C.J. Beathard is from Franklin, Tenn. \n16. Wisconsin senior fullback Derek Watt and sophomore linebacker T.J. Watt are brothers of J.J. Watt, the former Badger who was the NFL’s Defensive Player of the Year for the Houston Texans in 2014. \n17. Brock Huard is ESPN’s color analyst for this game. He and Damon Huard were the first pair of brothers to start at quarterback in the same NFL weekend, on Nov. 26, 2000. Brock Huard had six career touchdown passes in a pro career that stretched from 1999 to 2004. \n18. Mike + Ruthy perform Friday night at CSPS Hall in Cedar Rapids. Saturday night, they’ll be at Three Brothers Farm in Oconomowoc, Wis.
