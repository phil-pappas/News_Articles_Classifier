Two others fled, according to prosecutors. Five years later, testimony began Wednesday at Marcus Floyd's trial at the Leighton Criminal Court Building. He is the third and last defendant to go to trial for Wortham's killing.\nProsecutors have alleged that Wortham, 30, was fatally shot as four men tried to rob him of his new motorcycle in front of his parents' home in the Chatham neighborhood. Wortham drew his gun, identified himself as a cop and exchanged gunfire with the two Floyds, according to prosecutors.\nJury finds man fit to stand trial in 2010 killing of Chicago cop Steve Schmadeke A Cook County jury deliberated a little more than an hour Thursday before deciding that a man charged with killing off-duty Chicago police Officer Thomas Wortham IV was mentally fit to stand trial despite his alleged amnesia.\nThe decision came after an unusual three-day hearing at the Leighton Criminal...\nA Cook County jury deliberated a little more than an hour Thursday before deciding that a man charged with killing off-duty Chicago police Officer Thomas Wortham IV was mentally fit to stand trial despite his alleged amnesia.\nThe decision came after an unusual three-day hearing at the Leighton Criminal...\n(Steve Schmadeke) Toyious Taylor, the driver of the getaway car, and Paris McGee, whom the elder Wortham said fired a shot at him before the two fled, have already been convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\nA separate Cook County jury decided in August that Floyd was mentally fit to stand trial even though he allegedly can't remember what happened that night. Floyd suffered \"retrograde amnesia\" when his brain was deprived of oxygen after losing massive amounts of blood, his attorneys contended. He also suffered two heart attacks and spent a week in a coma.\nWith no available tests to prove or disprove whether Floyd had amnesia, the jury decided Floyd was able to help his attorneys in his defense and understood the criminal charges and the basic elements of courtroom proceedings.\nFloyd's lawyers made no mention of his alleged amnesia during opening statements Wednesday.\nsschmadeke@tribpub.com\nTwitter @SteveSchmadeke\nDefendant in cop killing alleges he's mentally unfit because of amnesia Steve Schmadeke A Cook County jury has been asked to decide a most unusual issue: Is a defendant who is charged in the killing of off-duty Chicago police Officer Thomas Wortham IV mentally unfit to stand trial because he can't remember any details from the incident?\nMarcus Floyd, wounded in a shootout with Wortham...\nA Cook County jury has been asked to decide a most unusual issue: Is a defendant who is charged in the killing of off-duty Chicago police Officer Thomas Wortham IV mentally unfit to stand trial because he can't remember any details from the incident?\nMarcus Floyd, wounded in a shootout with Wortham...\n(Steve Schmadeke) Homicide Chicago Police Department", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55d62b0c/turbine/ct-chicago-cop-killing-defendant-amnesia-met-0821-20150820", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561eb4bb/turbine/ct-chicago-cop-killing-trial-met-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55d3935b/turbine/ct-chicago-cop-killiing-defendant-amnesia-met-20150818"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:22:46.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
