Mike Krzyzewski will become a \"special advisor\" for the team after the 2016 Olympic Games. \n“I'm extremely humbled and honored to have the opportunity to represent our country as the coach of the USA National Team,” said Popovich, a 1970 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy. “What the program has accomplished over the last decade under the leadership of Jerry Colangelo and Mike Krzyzewski is truly impressive. I will do my utmost to maintain the high standards of success, class and character established by Jerry, Coach K and the many players who have sacrificed their time on behalf of USA Basketball.” \n… \n“I am honored, and thrilled, to continue with USA Basketball in the role of special advisor. Since Jerry Colangelo invited me to play a larger part in the USA Basketball program in 2005, this experience has been so rewarding professionally and personally,” said Krzyzewski. “Some of the most exhilarating moments in my coaching career have occurred because of that association, so I am humbled to continue the affiliation with USA Basketball in this capacity. Until then, we have significant work to do to properly prepare our team for the challenges we'll face in Rio at the 2016 Olympics. \n“Gregg Popovich is the ideal choice to take over as head coach of the USA program. His long track record of success – both in terms of winning championships and creating a culture of excellence – are well documented and, rightfully so, he is considered among the very best coaches in the world. Because of his military background in which he selflessly served his country, coupled with his unique ability to bring out the best in his teams, this leadership appointment makes perfect sense. Undeniably, he will incorporate the highest of standards, which are unique to him, that will only enhance the USA Basketball program. I look forward to working with and learning from Gregg and Jerry Colangelo as they lead Team USA into the future.\" \nEssentially, this means Popovich will coach the team at training camps in 2017 and 2018, the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China and the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo will stay in his role until 2020. \nHere are three things to know about this decision: \n1. Popovich was the obvious choice here . The press release leads by referring to his five NBA championships, but it's more than that. He's created arguably the most successful culture in professional sports, one that just about every organization in the NBA has tried to emulate. As well as being perhaps the NBA's best tactician, he has the respect of all the league's stars and the ability to make talented players think team-first. While he said he was humbled to represent his country, USA Basketball should consider itself lucky that he decided to add to his workload. \n2. It remains to be seen what this means for the construction of Team USA . Under Krzyzewski, rosters weren't always pure All-Star teams -- while most of the players had high profiles, he also wanted guys who he knew would be willing to accept lesser roles. One guess: that will continue and perhaps intensify with Popovich, who often talks about the Spurs looking for people who have \"gotten over themselves.\" Everybody knows that Kawhi Leonard will represent America in the future -- could someone like Danny Green get an invite, too? \n3. In the meantime, Coach K isn't quite done . Krzyzewski, who came aboard in 2005, has had an extremely successful run with the national program. Before he arrived, the United States was having trouble in international competition, failing to medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indiana and going 5-3 en route to a bronze medal at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. \nAfter losing one game at the 2006 FIBA World Championship and earning a bronze medal, Team USA won gold at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey, the 2012 Olympics in London and the 2014 FIBA World Cup in Spain. Krzyzewski will get a chance to cap his tenure off at the 2016 Olympics in Rio before giving the reins to Popovich. \nGregg Popovich is the new coach of Team USA. )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:47:51.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
