(AP) â€” The Detroit Lions have signed defensive tackle Andre Fluellen and put defensive tackle Tyrunn Walker on injured reserve. \nWalker is out for the season because of a dislocated ankle and broken leg, and the Lions confirmed Wednesday they have signed Fluellen. \nThe 30-year-old Fluellen has played off and on for the Lions since they drafted him in the third round in 2008. He's played 75 games for Detroit, including eight last season. \nLinebacker DeAndre Levy participated in practice on Wednesday. Levy has not played in the Lions first four games but could possibly return to action on Sunday against Arizona. \nTight end Brandon Pettigrew also returned to the practice field for Detroit. Pettigrew has not played since Week 1 in San Diego. Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc. The Associated Press contributed to this report. All rights reserved.
