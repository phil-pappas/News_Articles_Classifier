(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) \nKAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) — Germany’s Jan Frodeno won the Ironman World Championship on Saturday, pulling away in the bike leg in scorching conditions. \nThe 34-year-old Frodeno completed the 2.4-mile ocean swim, 112-mile bike leg and marathon run in 8 hours, 14 minutes, 40 seconds. He was second after the swim and took the lead for good 95 miles into the bike leg. \nFrodeno finished the swim in 50:50, the bike ride in 4:27:28 and the run in 2:52:22. \nGermany’s Andreas Raelert was second, followed by American Timothy O’Donnell. \n“Thank you so much. I’m sorry to take it from an American again. I’m glad T.O. didn’t have any garlic last night. He was breathing down my neck again. I am just over the world. It would be nothing without you guys.” \nFrodeno, who was third last year, also is the reigning Ironman 70.3 world champion and won the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
