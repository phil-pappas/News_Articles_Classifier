Monmouth-Roseville senior Sam Gillen missed going to state by two shots his junior year. Then on Monday, Gillen missed by only one shot with a 78 at the Lincoln Class 2A Boys Sectional. He had a steady day of golf with a 38 on the front and a 40. He had no birdies, but parred 9 of the 18 holes (1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13). His only really tough hole was a triple bogey on No. 10 hole. \"It was a solid round,\" Gillen said. \"I just enjoyed being around them (the team) every day, a good group of guys.\" M-R senior Nate Bizarri finished up the day strong with an 84. Bizarri shot a 10 on the No. 3 hole (par 4), but bounced back to eagle No. 18 (par 5). Bizarri shot an even-par 36 on the back nine. Added Reece, \"It was a pretty tough day and the wind picked up. He (Gillen) had a pretty strong year. He's always fighting to stay in it and keeps his mind right.\" Titan junior Brayden Reece shot a 84 (42-42), freshman Nick Corman shot an 86 (41-45), senior Nathan Corman shot an 88 and sophomore Lane Frieden added a 90. M-R coach Mark Shrader, meanwhile, was pleased with his team's season. \"It was a great experience for the guys who will be coming back and I'm very happy with how we played. They seniors did a nice job for us this year.\" Earning medalist was Springfield's Bailey Gill with a 68. Galesburg news: Sean Peterson had a pretty good strategy going into Monday's Lincoln Sectional. \"When I was on the greens, I was thinking I have to make this to go to state,\" he said. \"I said that every time. I'm just happy I shot good.\" Peterson went on to shoot a 34 on the front and a 37 on the back nine of the Lincoln Elks Country Club, finishing the day with an even-par 71. He rattled off five birdies on the day (3, 5, 10, 11 and 13). One shot back was Silver Streak teammate Noah Benbow at 72, with three birdies on the day (5, 16 and 18). \"I had a lot of good looks at birdies, but nothing fell,\" Benbow said. \"I putted well and am happy with how I played. A lot of positive thoughts going on.\" As far as his strategy, Benbow said, \"Hit fairways and go from there. One shot at a time. I knew I could play well.\" The cutoff mark for individuals was a 77 or lower of a non-qualifying team and GHS coach Steve Cheesman said the golfers would need a 76 going into the sectional. Morton was the overall winner with a sizzling 301. Also advancing to state as a team were Normal U-High (314) and Dunlap (317). Rounding out the Galesburg individuals at state were senior Mark Mangieri (91) and freshman Lucas Watson (93).
