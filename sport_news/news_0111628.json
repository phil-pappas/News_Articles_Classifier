The Bears chewed up yardage like a Tasmanian devil in a 34-7 road victory. New Bern accumulated 349 yards rushing and four touchdowns, led by senior Ray’shi Bolds’ effort of 189 yards and three touchdowns. “I was just seeing grass and the end zone,” Bolds said. “I have to start with my offensive line, no running back can do it all themselves. It was really just another game to me and now that we got this one out of the way, I’m already thinking about C.B. Aycock.” Junior D.J. Howard piled up 118 yards and a score on the ground. “Our run game and power game is what got us jumpstarted this season,” New Bern coach Bobby Curlings said. The Bears have now reeled off four straight wins after beginning the season with three losses. “It’s amazing the way the kids have stayed together and how it made them closer,” Curlings said. “They never hung their heads, never let it get them too down and kept working.” Though he only completed one pass for 25 yards, that pass was for a touchdown to Tyjeer Hicks. The passing game was the only place Eastern Wayne could find any success against the Bears’ defense. The Warriors’ K.K. Best threw for 146 yards, as the team managed just 41 yards on the ground. “We can play with anybody for 2 1/2 quarters, then we just get tired and lose it,” Eastern Wayne coach Philemon Gray said. “We wanted to try and open up the pass with New Bern tonight and then Rose Friday.” New Bern led just 14-7 at the half, but was able to string together more substantial drives over the final two frames. Linebacker Charles Nobles led the defense with a fumble recovery and two interceptions. “Our guys got kind of re-focused at halftime,” Curlings said. “Halftime couldn’t get here soon enough as we were playing pretty sloppy but Eastern Wayne has some athletes over there and they can make plays.” Wide receiver Austin Hite had three catches for 68 yards to lead the Warrior pass catchers. New Bern improves to 4-3 and remains unbeaten in the Eastern Carolina Conference at 3-0, while Eastern Wayne falls to 2-4, 0-2. The Bears are off with an open date Friday and will host C.B. Aycock Oct. 23.
