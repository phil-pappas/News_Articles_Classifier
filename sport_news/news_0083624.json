(Image Source: David Banks/Getty Images) \n(13) Northwestern at (18) Michigan – 3:30 on BTN: \nBased on rankings alone, the Ohio State Buckeyes and Michigan State Spartans are the top two teams in the B1G. Based on the body of work and the play of the teams this season, the two most impressive schools in the conference are the Northwestern Wildcats and the Michigan Wolverines. Those two defensively elite teams clash in the “Big House” on Saturday afternoon in Ann Arbor. \nSince losing to Utah in the opening week of the season, the Michigan Wolverines have outscored their four opponents 122-14 and are fresh off of back-to-back shutouts (first-time since 2000 for that) against BYU and at Maryland. The Wolverines are now the third-ranked team in the advanced stats-based S&P+ rankings and they are only surrendering 7.6 points per game. Their lone loss on the season looks significantly better today than many anticipated it would as Utah has turned out to be an unbeaten, top-10 team. \nLinebackers Joe Bolden and Desmond Morgan lead the way for this elite defense that is playing with the kind of physicality and edge that we have come to expect from a Jim Harbaugh led team. The offense is attempting to play with the same identity but, so far, results have been a bit less inspiring. The passing game is not explosive but Jake Rudock is starting to do a better job of taking care of the ball. Rudock is mainly charged with handing the ball off to the running backs. De’Veon Smith is the best of the bunch and he should be back from a foot injury that kept him from playing against Maryland. This is a borderline top-50 unit that appears to be improving each week. \nThey’ll have their hands full on Saturday going against a defense that is almost equal to the one they deal with each day as the Northwestern Wildcats enter Michigan Stadium. The Cats have surprised by stunning Stanford in week one, winning at Duke and drilling Minnesota last week. Much like Michigan, they’ve relied on a stingy defense (ranked 6th in the country per S&P+) and a ball control offense. \nSophomore linebacker Anthony Walker has played at an All-B1G level and the safety duo of Traveon Henry and Godwin Igwebuike has helped shutdown opposing passing attacks. The Northwestern offense relies on the outstanding Justin Jackson and supporting backs Warren Long and Solomon Vault . Much like Rudock, quarterback Clayton Thorson is mostly charged with taking care of the ball and being efficient. In my opinion, these teams attempt to do things in a very similar fashion but I think Michigan is going to be better at those things on Saturday. \nNorthwestern’s defense is incredibly strong against the pass but teams have been able to have a bit of success on the ground. Duke ran the ball for 177 yards and 5.1 yards per carry and Ball State churned out 181 rushing yards and 5.3 yards per rush. That’s not to say the Cats are weak against the run but if you are looking for a way to attack this very strong defense, on the ground would be the way to go. The “Big House” will be rocking and I expect this to be a very low-scoring and physical contest between two teams with B1G title aspirations. \nTo Read More From Sammy Jacobs, TJ Inman & Nick Holmes of HoosierHuddle.com , click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:29:36.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
