He thinks about Union High School, where he starred at quarterback for three years under coach Bill Blankenship. He thinks about Tuttle Stadium, the best high-school stadium in the state, where he spent one summer helping lay down new field turf.\n\"That turf's long gone,\" Fuente said with a grin, \"but that's got some pretty good memories.\"\nFuente's home has changed a few times over the past 15 years, as job opportunities have bounced him from Normal, Illinois, to Fort Worth, Texas, and now to Memphis. But his roots are, and always have been, in Tulsa. His parents, Jim and Lynn, still live in the area. So does his sister, Jamie, her husband and their three kids. Fuente has aunts and uncles in Tulsa. Grandparents. Friends.\nSo when Fuente returns there Friday night for No. 18 Memphis' game against Tulsa, it will be a true homecoming. It will be his first game in his hometown as a collegiate head coach. It will be special.\n\"It's special because I love Tulsa, Oklahoma,\" Fuente said. \"It's special for non-football reasons, just for me.\"\nMemphis' fourth-year coach tries to visit Tulsa twice every year to see family and friends — once in the summer and once in the winter. \"This is kind of a bonus,\" he said.\nHis father said about 60 tickets have been set aside for family and friends at Friday's game. Many will cheer in the rain as Fuente leads the Tigers, who have won 13 consecutive games, into the second half of the season.\nWatching his son's game will be a full-circle moment for Jim Fuente, but mostly it will be something else.\n\"Stressful,\" he said. \"All his games are stressful. We've been living with Justin's football career ever since he was in the fifth grade.\"\nThat's when Justin Fuente tried to convince his father to let him play tackle football for the first time. They went to a game. \"I think you'll be all right out there,\" Jim Fuente said.\nJustin Fuente was on the field a year later. He wanted to be a tight end.\nBy high school, it had become apparent that plan would not work out. Fuente had an arm. He was a quarterback. He took over the starting job as a sophomore upon the arrival of a new coach, Blankenship, who was and continues to be one of his most important mentors.\n\"He was special enough early that my first year, the senior quarterback and the junior quarterback both moved positions on their own. They volunteered to move,\" Blankenship said in an interview earlier this season. \"It was just clear — everybody saw it.\"\nFuente threw for 2,934 yards and 32 touchdowns as a senior, leading Union High School to the state championship game in Oklahoma's largest classification. But he threw two interceptions in that game, a loss to Midwest City , and admits the memory of that night probably sticks out more than any other over the course of his high-school career.\n\"It's not a pleasant memory,\" he said, \"but I do remember it.\"\nSoon thereafter, Fuente committed to the University of Oklahoma, choosing the Sooners over Oklahoma State, Texas A&M and Tulsa. \"It came down to OU and Tulsa,\" he told The Oklahoman at the time.\nFuente spent two years at Oklahoma before the school changed coaching staffs and he decided to transfer to Murray State. He set 11 school records for the Racers, then played briefly with the Oklahoma Wranglers of the Arena League.\nFuente's focus shifted to coaching in 2001, when he began tutoring quarterbacks at Illinois State. It was a move those who know him always saw coming.\n\"Justin was a guy that learned really fast. He loved the details of the game. He loved to be coached,\" said Blankenship, who is now an offensive analyst at Memphis. \"So I'm not surprised. But I also thought, kind of like a parent, that he has enough stuff about him that he'll go be a doctor or a lawyer or something, some other kind of leader. But once he got into coaching, it didn't take long.\"\nFuente's journey from Illinois State quarterbacks coach to Memphis head coach took him barely more than a decade. Now, it's brought him back here, to Tulsa, near the house where he grew up and the high-school field where he laid down field turf. Now, he is one of most popular up-and-coming coaches in the country. He's on a business trip — make no mistake about that — but a business trip with a personal touch.\n\"It's always nice to go home,\" Fuente said.", "external_links": ["http://newsok.com/article/2485692", "http://newsok.com/article/2490389"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:32:01.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
