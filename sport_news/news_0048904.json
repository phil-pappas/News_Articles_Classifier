At close, England had made 56-0, trailing by 467 runs.\nFor Pakistan, Shoaib Malik hit a career-best 245 while Asad Shafiq made 107 as England's bowlers toiled under hot conditions.\nStokes, who claimed 4-57 to spark a mini-collapse in the post-tea session, sympathised with Rashid who was selected for the tour with spin tracks in mind.\n\"It hasn't gone the way he would have wanted it to,\" said Stokes of Rashid whose figures were worse than Australian leg-spinner Bryce McGain's 0-149 in his debut Test against South Africa at Cape Town in 2009.\n\"We've been here for two weeks and know how well Rashid's been bowling in practice. Next time he has the ball in hand hopefully he can deliver something big,\" said Stokes.\n\"He doesn't seem to get down too much, or get too high. I've played a bit of one-day cricket with him and when he's done well he hasn't got outside of his box or celebrated over the top.\n\"I think he's a pretty level-headed cricketer, and I think he'll be able to put this behind him.\"\nBesides Rashid, off-spinner Moeen Ali also failed to claim a wicket in his 30 overs, conceding 121 runs.\n\"I think it's just to do with how good subcontinent players are against spin. We aren't looking into that deeply at all. It could have been the other way around, they could have got the eight wickets instead of the seamers,\" said Stokes.\n\"It was very tough day and a half. That's the longest I have ever spent in the field, 40 degrees doesn't help either but all the bowlers stuck at their task very, very well without getting much from the pitch or in the air.\n\"So we just had to plug away and not get bored. But credit to Pakistan, they played very well.\"\nStokes said skipper Alastair Cook (39 not out) and Ali (15 not out) did well to negotiate 21 overs before close.\n\"The two batsmen gave themselves time to get in. They didn't really look to change gears, they just knew they needed to go big because they know the pitch will deteriorate and that the first innings will be big.\n\"Cooky and Mo have set the tone for the next two days of batting, so to come off after what could have been a dodgy 25 overs, none down, is a great effort.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-15T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:04:01.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
