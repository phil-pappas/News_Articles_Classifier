At left are Millburn’s Niamh Freeman (23) and Phoebe Oxley (11).The contest ended in a 2-2 draw. \nHailey Mroczek, the first-year coach of Millburn High School’s junior varsity girls soccer team, exudes her players to \"raise the bar\" each time the play a match. \nThey have done that almost to perfection as the Millers entered this week’s action sporting an 8-0-1 record. \n\"The way the team plays as a whole, determines their success,\" said Mroczek, whose squad reeled off six consecutive wins to open the season before playing a 2-2 draw Sept. 26 with visiting Livingston High School. \n\"Captains Rachel Hubertus, Kathleen Cioffi and Sara Bressler say that one of the biggest reasons that our team is so successful this season is because all the players have such good chemistry together and it shows in the game,\" Mroczek said. \nThe Millers commenced the season Sept. 9 with a 6-2 defeat of visiting Nutley High School. \nA 3-2 defeat of host Montclair High School on Sept. 11, the team’s lone match to be decided by a single goal, was followed by a 6-1 rout Sept. 16 of visiting Morristown High School. \nMillburn posted shutout wins in its next two outings - a 5-0 defeat Sept. 18 of visiting Glen Ridge High School and a 2-0 win Sept. 21 at Caldwell High School. The local booters improved to 6-0 with a 6-2 win over West Essex High School Sept. 26 in North Caldwell. \nFollowing the draw with Livingston, the Millers posted a 4-0 win Sept. 29 over host Nutley High School and a 3-1 defeat Oct. 1 against visiting Montclair. \nPhoebe Oxley and Emily Kanter are the team’s leading goal scorers according to Mroczek. \n\"With Phoebe’s determination and Emily’s speed, these girls are unstoppable in the attacking one-third,\" Mroczek said. \nHubertus \"is the ultimate playmaker,\" added Mroczek. \"She has a vision for through balls and is the focus of the attack. With the ball at her feet she can be a real electrifying player.\" \nThe team’s strength, according to Mroczek, is a strong center. \n\"The players that contribute to this strength are, but not limited to, Nikki Mahendru, Yenna Ji, Rachel Kanter, Tori DeFilippo and Gina Saggio,\" Mroczek said. \n\"The center position is one of the most pivotal positions on the field,\" Mroczek said. \"Niamh Freeman has done an excellent job thus far due to her decisions on the ball and her vision of the field. In this position, Niamh plays an instrumental role in the team’s offensive attack.\" \nNot to be overlooked is the role of the squad’s defensive players. \n\"These girls work hard each day to improve their communication and defensive craft,\" Mroczek said. \n-Jim Connelly © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:17:26.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
