The final scene in the movie, the one with all of the dusty crates.\nOregon has a place sort of like that â€“ a government warehouse of rare historical antiquities and artifacts in a secret location. More than 85,000 items are cataloged in the Oregon Historical Society's warehouse.\nHere's a quick rundown:\n35,000 books. Six million photographs. 12,000 linear feet of manuscripts. 30,000 maps. 1,000 periodical titles. 16,000 reels of newspaper microfilm. 5,500 vertical files of clippings and other information. 8.5 million feet of film and video. 6,000 items of oral history. Last week, executive director Kerry Tymchuk and library director Geoff Wexler gave me a brief tour of the facility. In reality, you could spend days inside and not see everything. I was there for about an hour.\nOne condition of my visit: I couldn't divulge the address. But they allowed me to take as many pictures as I wanted.\nI decided to use 10 of the shots for this week's Throwback Thursday quiz. Have fun. There are a couple gimmes. And good luck.", "external_links": ["http://app.contenttools.co/trivia/1121/embed.js?show_name=yes&show_description=yes&show_sharing_options=yes&show_cover_image=yes", "http://giphy.com/gifs/indiana-jones-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-not-quite-my-tempo-x7j4iKzPCz1m0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fdjf4lMmiiI"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:10:52.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
