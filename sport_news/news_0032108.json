The boys soccer draw highlighted the announcements for the county. \nAs, River View (7-6-1) was voted into the 7th seed and will host county-rival and 11-seed Coshocton (4-5-4) at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 20. Hosting the contest could be to the Black Bears' advantage, but they lost both regular season matches by a score of 2-0, including the most recent game Saturday. \nBlack Bears coach Mike Burr said though his team is the higher seed that they have nothing to lose in the matchup. \n\"If this game was on the board in Vegas, Coshocton would probably be the favorite,\" Burr said. \"We’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain.\" \nThe way the draw is done gives each team a chance to choose where they want to be placed on the bracket in order of the seeds. Because the Black Bears held the seventh seed, they had the choice to avoid a potential matchup with undefeated and one-seed Minerva and move to the bottom of the bracket, which they did. \nCoshocton, with the 11th seed, had many matchups to choose from with half of the bracket filled out already, but coach Brian Dunlap said he chose the River View matchup because of familarity. \n\"The concerns I had with some of these teams were with the field conditions and I haven’t seen very many of these other teams play,\" Dunlap said. \n\"Apparently they are pretty confident they can beat us I guess,\" Burr said. \nDunlap said the thought that they beat River View twice already did cross his mind when picking the matchup. \n\"Sure, I feel confident that we can play with them and hopefully take care of business. They are a good team. it will be a battle to beat a team three times in a season,\" Dunlap said. \"But the main thing was the field, I felt like it is similar to what we are playing on.\" \nWhile many parents, students and players may be looking ahead to this matchup, the regular season isn't over yet. Coshocton has two games left and River View has one. Nothing the teams do now will impact their playoff position, but both play talented and capable teams, so it can impact their confidence entering the matchup. \n\"Our mission is to get better for the playoffs. Each game is a stepping stone for the playoffs. This week is just as important as the last one,\" Dunlap said. \n\"We will have to use the next game to get ready for the postseason,\" Burr said \"We don’t want to go into the tournament on a two-game skid.\" \nGirls Soccer Seedings \nCoshocton received a three seed in the Division III East District and will host five-seed Edison on Oct. 22 with the time to be determined. \nRiver View received a four seed in the Division II East District and will host the winner of Steubenville and Dover at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 21. \nRidgewood received an 18 seed in the Division II East District and will travel to second-seed John Glenn on Oct. 21. \nVolleyball Seedings \nRidgewood received a three seed in the Division III East District and will host Newcomerstown at 6 p.m. Oct. 20. \nRiver View received a nine-seed in the Division II East District and will host Carrollton at 6 p.m. Oct. 20. \nCoshocton received an 11 seed in the Division III East District and will travel to play seven-seed Sandy Valley at 6 p.m. Oct. 20.
