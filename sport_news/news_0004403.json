But they had only two tight ends, which was a source of \"uneasiness\" for the coaching staff.\nSo the Saints agreed to deal Hicks to the New England Patriots for tight end Michael Hoomanawanui .\n\"I would say (it came about) fairly quickly,\" Payton said Wednesday. \"It's not unusual, a trade like this, where we've been looking for some depth at the tight end position and at the same time we felt like we had a handful of young defensive linemen. Having had a chance to practice with (the Patriots), both teams are familiar with the other player. So it was really over a matter or two or two-and-a-half days.\"\nHicks was already losing reps to Bobby Richardson, one of the three undrafted rookies who made the club out of training camp, and he had referenced being \"benched\" in Week 2. At the time, Payton bristled at that term, saying the Saints were simply looking for more pass-rush production.\nBut Hicks' discontent had nothing to do with the trade, Payton said.\n\"No, not at all. He's been fantastic as a teammate and as a guy that works. I mean that,\" Payton said. \"We've had good visits up in the office, talking about the position, the offseason, the weight we wanted him at.\n\"He's been fantastic to coach. It was really a decision based on the younger players we were wanting to get more work with. And I think it has a chance to be a real good fit for him. That was the main reason for the trade.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:05:07.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
