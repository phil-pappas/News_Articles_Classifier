(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- In the District championship showdown that proved to be all it was hyped up to be, the Strafford Lady Indians held on for back-to-back District titles against the Fair Grove Lady Eagles on Tuesday night in a three-set battle. It was the third meeting of the season for the two rivals, with Fair Grove handing Strafford two of the team’s just three regular season losses in the previous matchups. Both schools anticipated a fight to the finish in a repeat of last year’s title match and the game didn’t disappoint.“I knew going into it, having been beaten by Fair Grove twice, that we would really have to step our game up,” Strafford coach Ashley Bough said. “They competed and they showed composure on the court and that’s something we’ve been working on all year. That’s what I’m most proud of.” CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE MATCH Fair Grove took the first set 25-16 and it seemed the match was headed to a very different outcome. Then Strafford came out firing in the second and went up 4-1 before the Lady Eagles’ seven-point run put them up 8-4. Momentum shifted back to the Lady Indians who regained the lead at 17-16 and scored the next seven of nine points. The Lady Eagles fought their way back to tie it at 23, but Strafford reached the first game point. Fair Grove tied it back up at 24 before the Lady Indians put up two straight points to win 26-24 and sent the match into the tiebreaker round.“The game’s not over until it gets to 25,” Bough said. “If we get down 10 points, if we battle back and have the mentality of one point at a time, we can come back and that’s what they did. I never felt like tonight that we were losing or that we had lost.” With momentum on their side, the Lady Indians jumped to an early lead in the final set. Fair Grove couldn’t stop the Indian attack and Strafford took the third set 25-16 to claim their second straight District title.“Of course we knew this was going to be a dogfight—the third time we’ve seen Strafford,” said Fair Grove coach Tonya Peck. “We won the first two and to beat a good team three times in a row is extremely difficult.” Chloe Rear led the Indian attack with 16 kills and 3 blocks. Logan Eden had 19 assists and Grace Myers came up with 20 digs. Kaylee Larimer put down 2 aces.“Once we got into that second set and that third set we started clicking and everything went into place and we were playing Strafford volleyball,” Larimer said. Leading the Eagle offense with 9 kills each were Jorden Stacey and Alana Findley. Stacey had 21 assists as setter and Findley came up big with 5 blocks. Haley Stallings had 37 digs. Coach Peck said the team executed extremely well the first game, but failed to take advantage of opportunities in the later sets.“I feel like the second game slipped through our hands,” Peck said. “I feel like that’s the game we should have taken care of business and won, but you can’t sit back on your heels against a good team like Strafford.” It is the end of the road for the 30-4 Lady Eagles who are feeling more the loss of seven seniors than the loss of a potential District title.“It’s not all about the volleyball,” Peck said. “It’s about the memories, it’s about loving each other and having fun while you’re working hard and these seven seniors definitely taught our kids, so the rest of my group is going to have to step up.” The Lady Indians, now 30-3-1, will have home court advantage in the Sectional round of the State tournament when they face Liberty at noon on Saturday, October 24.“We’re hungry for more,” Bough said. “We’re never satisfied here.” Filed Under :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:40:06.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
