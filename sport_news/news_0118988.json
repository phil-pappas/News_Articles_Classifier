(Tim Schwartz/Howard County Times video) Tim Schwartz Contact Reporter Mustangs score 28 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to beat Oakland Mills, 28-15, and improve to 5-1 \nMarriotts Ridge sophomore Eli Turner practices one-handed catches everyday at practice. It’s an art he knew would need one day, perhaps in a big spot when his team needed it most. \nThat’s what he delivered on Monday, as he reached up with his left hand and pulled in a 44-yard touchdown pass from Mustangs senior quarterback Tyler Poole in the fourth quarter to cut Oakland Mills’ lead to 15-13. \n“I said to him, ‘can I get your autograph, Odell?’” said Marriotts Ridge senior wide receiver Chris Meekins referencing New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham and his knack for one-handed catches. “That was a crazy catch.” \nThe Scorpions fumbled on the next play and the Mustangs took advantage, getting the eventual go-ahead touchdown seven plays later on Troy Hensh’s 13-yard run in a 28-15 win over Oakland Mills. \n“Once Eli made that catch – it was a pretty good throw – I knew we were in business,” said Marriotts Ridge coach Marcus Lewis. “We had momentum, and then they turn the ball over, and we just kept building from there.” Eli Turner Photo courtesy of Lori Miller \nMarriotts Ridge sophomore Eli Turner runs the ball during the Mustangs' 28-15 upset win versus Oakland Mills on Oct. 12. \nMarriotts Ridge sophomore Eli Turner runs the ball during the Mustangs' 28-15 upset win versus Oakland Mills on Oct. 12. (Photo courtesy of Lori Miller) \nThe Mustangs scored 28 unanswered fourth-quarter points to beat their region rivals, who were playing without quarterback Tre Hopkins because of a lower left leg injury he suffered in the Scorpions’ loss to Howard on Oct. 2. He was not in uniform and was on crutches on the sideline. \n“It’s a good win for us. They weren’t playing with all their bullets, and they did what good teams do and came out short-handed and punched us in the mouth,” Lewis said. “Thank goodness we reacted well in the second half. If we keep doing what they’re doing and we keep doing what we’re doing, we’re going to see them again, and they’ll be fully loaded.” Marriotts Ridge football preparing for week 1 Marriotts Ridge head football coach Marcus Lewis talks about expectations for his team in 2015.

However, Oakland Mills’ defense stood tall and forced a turnover on downs at its own 16. \nAfter both teams went three and out, Oakland Mills quarterback Naquan Williams-Day and the offense found its groove. Williams-Day ran for 48 yards on four runs in the five-play drive, the last of which was a four-yard touchdown run. Shawn Harris caught a James Pindell pass for a two-point conversion and an 8-0 lead early in the second quarter. \nOn their next drive, the Scorpions once again stuck with the run and went 65 yards on seven plays to take a 15-0 lead after Williams-Day ran for another touchdown from eight yards out. \n“The first half, we didn’t play our best,” Lewis said. “We just kind of woke up in the second half.” \nThe second half, though, was a completely different ball game. \n“I actually think as soon as we walked out on this field after halftime, that was the turning point,” Meekins said. “We knew we could get the win, and if we did what we had to do we would come away with the win.” \nThe Mustangs stopped Oakland Mills on a fourth down and one, but Poole threw and interception as Dyllan Rankins tipped it and caught it himself. \nThe Scorpions gave the ball back on the very next play, though, when Jaden Ealey fumbled at their own 35. \n“The turnovers were big obviously. It’s going to be like that in a big game like this,” Lewis said. “They had them, and we didn’t. We got them at inopportune times and got short fields, and we used them to our benefit.” \nOn a fourth down and four, Trayvon Delk started the fourth-quarter rally with 29-yard touchdown catch and run down the right sideline to cut the lead deficit to 15-7. \nOakland Mills went three and out, and Delk ran for 15 yards on the Mustangs’ first play on the ensuing drive to the Scorpions’ 38. With the crowd roaring and momentum clearly on Marriotts Ridge’s side, two plays later Poole found Turner down the middle of the field for the one-handed touchdown catch. \n“Gutsy,” Lewis said of his quarterback. “He hurt himself a little bit in the first quarter, missed a series, came back and was all guts.” \nThe next play, Scorpions running back Paul Johnson fumbled and gave the ball back to the Mustangs with only 32 yards to go for the go-ahead score. \n“We had two turnovers in the second half, and that doesn’t help,” said Oakland Mills coach Tom Browne. “We just have to finish and put together drives. We’ve got to finish on defense, too. Guys put their heads down, and that was that.” \nPoole completed a nine-yard pass to Samie Costa on a fourth down and two, and Hensh, who is called \"Hammer\" by his teammates, finished the seven-play drive with a 13-yard touchdown run to give his team a 21-15 lead. \nWilliams-Day was stopped for a loss on fourth and four, and Marriotts Ridge scored a touchdown on its fourth straight drive to put a bow on the upset victory when Hensh ran in his second score from four yards out. \nLewis said this win is the biggest for the program “in a while. It means a lot to me because I went (to Oakland Mills), I taught there, I coached the state championship team that Tom (Browne) was on. So for me there are a lot of emotions because I still love that place, just not this time.” \nStill, he knows there is a lot of season left and a lot of good teams on the schedule. \n“This is a boost for us in the playoff race, but we still have a lot of good teams to play,” Lewis said. “We’ve still got Wilde Lake, Glenelg, Reservoir and Hebron.” \nFor Oakland Mills (4-2), it lost its second straight game after starting the season 4-0 and clearly missed its best playmaker in Hopkins. \n“We knew he wasn’t going to play all week, so we prepared for that,” said Oakland Mills coach Tom Browne. “I think we’re a good enough football team to win without him, and tonight we didn’t. Marriotts Ridge played great, and they made some good adjustments at halftime. My hat goes off to coach Lewis and Marriotts Ridge. They played a great game.” \nIn the game, Delk finished with 11 carries for 24 yards and a touchdown catch, while Poole completed eight of 12 passes for 135 yards and two touchdowns and an interception. Hensh ran for 35 yards and two touchdowns on five rushes. \nMarriotts Ridge (5-1) – 0 0 0 28 – 28 \nOakland Mills (4-2) – 0 15 0 0 – 15 \nSecond quarter \nOM: Naquan Williams-Day 4-yard run (Shawn Harris conversion) [0-8] \nOM: Williams-Day 8-yard run (Daniel MacKie kick) [0-15] \nFourth quarter \nMR: Tyler Poole 29-yard pass to Trayvon Delk (Zain Baig kick) [7-15] \nMR: Poole 44-yard pass to Eli Turner (conversion failed) [13-15] \nMR: Troy Hensh 13-yard run (Gunnar Barnard conversion) [21-15] \nMR: Hensh 5-yard run (Baig kick) [28-15] \nOther scores from Monday, Oct. 12 \nHoward (6-0) – 21 14 14 0 – 49 \nCentennial (0-6) – 0 7 7 8 – 22 \nFirst quarter \nHo: Malik Anderson 80-yard run (Gillespie kick) [7-0] \nHo: Casey Crawford 69-yard pass to Dylan Perez (Gillespie kick) [14-0] \nHo: Anderson 8-yard run (Gillespie kick) [21-0] \nSecond quarter \nHo: Crawford 5-yard pass to Donnie Place (Gillespie kick) [28-0] \nC: Klein 26-yard pass to Smith (Cooper kick) [28-7] \nHo: Jermaine Whittington 11-yard run (Gillespie kick) [35-7] \nThird quarter \nC: Klein 1-yard run (Cooper kick) [35-14] \nHo: Anderson 19-yard run (Gillespie kick) [42-14] \nHo: Whittington 1-yard run (Gillespie kick) [49-14] \nFourth quarter \nC: Klein 31-yard pass to Smith (Smith conversion) [42-22] \nHoward stats: \nPassing – Casey Crawford (4/6, 91 yards, 2 TD) \nRushing – Malik Anderson (13 carries, 234 yards, 3 TD) \nReceiving – Dylan Perez (1 reception, 69 yards, 1 TD) \nRiver Hill (3-3) – 0 14 7 14 – 35 \nLong Reach (2-4) – 0 6 0 16 – 22 \nScores from Saturday, Oct. 10 \nAtholton (3-3) – 0 14 15 6 – 35 \nMt.
