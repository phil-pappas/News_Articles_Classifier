We knew coming in that it was going to be an outstanding facility and we could get our work done and it wouldn't be any kind of a distraction\" said head coach Bruce Arians. \"I love it, I mean it's out here. It's peaceful, it's quiet nothing to do besides focus on football. Great facilites\" said DE Cory Redding. \nThey had a game in Detroit yesterday and will head to Pittsburgh on Sunday, and it all has to do with travel and the pressure in an airplane. \"You know the air does effect the body. You know a lot of have a lot of wear and tear and you know dealing with injuries every single week so swelling can take its toll and jet lagg takes it's toll you\" said Redding. \"Its a lot easier flying here rather then going all the way to Phoenix with all those guys that are hurt\" said Arians. \nCoach Arians also has ties to Virginia Tech as he played quarterback for them until he graduated in 78 and he says the Hokies are a lot like they are right now. \"They are just like us. They are good, bad, and ugly you know. I think the young quarterback is getting better and they have a lot of room to improve\" said Arians", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:35:34.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
