KING — State Journal \nUW wide receiver Alex Erickson celebrates a first-down catch against Miami (Ohio). He has 23 receptions for 320 yards this season. M.P. KING — State Journal \nThe West Division was supposed to be the shame of Big Ten Conference football. \nThat might still be the case — check back after the Big Ten Championship Game — but when the division races start in earnest today, the West figures to be far more interesting than the top-heavy East. \nA month ago, the University of Wisconsin was a slight favorite over Nebraska and Minnesota in the West. However, all three showed major flaws during non-conference play and many think they’ve been caught — if not passed — by Iowa and Northwestern, two unbeaten teams trying to recover from slumps in recent years. \nAlthough it’s hard to draw conclusions from non-conference results due to the uneven quality of the opponents, this much is clear: The West is wide open. The list of contenders has grown from three to five and it would surprise no one if any of the five earned a date opposite Ohio State or Michigan State in the Big Ten final. \n“I think there’s a lot of good teams,” UW quarterback Joel Stave said. “Now it’s time to see how good everyone is by playing each other.” \nThere’s no time like the present. Starting with today’s game between UW and Iowa at Camp Randall Stadium, the first three weeks of conference play are front-loaded with games matching the West’s big five. \nToday’s encounter between the Badgers and Hawkeyes might be the biggest of all, if only because UW and Iowa have the easiest schedules in the Big Ten. That will give the winner a leg up on the field, though anything can happen among five evenly matched teams. \nIowa and Nebraska have the hottest quarterbacks and, not surprisingly, the best offenses. UW, Northwestern and Minnesota have outstanding defenses. Northwestern and Iowa have the most impressive non-conference victories. UW and Iowa have the easiest Big Ten crossover games. Nebraska gets to play three of the other four contenders at home and Iowa must play three of them on the road. \nHere is how the West contenders shape up, with the teams listed in alphabetical order because it’s simply too close to call: \nIowa (4-0) \nWhy the Hawkeyes will win it: Coach Kirk Ferentz chose C.J. Beathard as his quarterback for a reason. Beathard is an accurate, mobile playmaker and the biggest reason the Hawkeyes are finally winning close games. Iowa is balanced, ranking third in offense and sixth in defense in the Big Ten. Its crossover games are Maryland and Indiana. It also is the healthiest of the contenders. \nWhy they won’t win it: Iowa has underachieved for years and its two wins over Power Five opponents were against so-so competition (Iowa State and Pitt). Offensive tackle, usually a position of strength, is suspect. Iowa must play UW, Nebraska and Northwestern on the road. \nMinnesota (3-1) \nWhy the Gophers will win it: Coach Jerry Kill has built an up-and-coming program around the old-school formula of running the ball and playing stout defense. The defense has remained strong despite a siege of injuries to the vaunted secondary. \nWhy they won’t win it: The offense struggled in three-point victories over Colorado State, Kent State and Ohio and the 19.2 scoring average is last in the Big Ten. Mitch Leidner is an inconsistent passer and the running game is last in the conference. Minnesota’s crossover games are against Michigan and Ohio State. Ouch. \nNebraska (2-2) \nWhy the Cornhuskers will win it: In a conference teeming with high-profile quarterbacks, Tommy Armstrong has been the best passer. Under first-year coach Mike Riley, the offense ranks third in scoring in the Big Ten. Electric wide receiver De’Mornay Pierson-El is due back from injury this week. The Huskers get Iowa, Northwestern and UW at home. \nWhy they won’t win it: And you thought ex-coach Bo Pelini’s defense was bad. Nebraska’s banged-up defense ranks 12th in the Big Ten and horrendous secondary play cost it dearly in last-second losses to BYU and Miami (Fla.). The Huskers are the only one of the five contenders that plays Michigan State. \nNorthwestern (4-0) \nWhy the Wildcats will win it: The defense, led by linebacker Anthony Walker, has been stellar, allowing a Big Ten-best 8.8 points per game. Tailback Justin Jackson leads the conference’s No. 1 rushing team. Non-conference victories over otherwise-unbeaten Stanford and Duke are looking better each week. \nWhy they won’t win it: Quarterback Clayton Thorson, though talented, is playing like a freshman and the Wildcats are last in the Big Ten in passing. If Minnesota is the Big Ten’s most banged-up team, Northwestern is a close second. It has Michigan and Penn State in tough crossover games and struggled to put away Ball State last week. \nWisconsin (3-1) \nWhy the Badgers will win it: The defense ranks second in the Big Ten with 9.5 points allowed and hasn’t given up a touchdown since the opener. Stave is improved and the inexperienced tailbacks show promise. The Badgers have Rutgers and Maryland in crossover games and both programs are a mess right now. \nWhy they won’t win it: The signature running game ranks ninth in the Big Ten while UW develops three new starters on the line and works to overcome the loss of tailback Corey Clement to sports hernia surgery. The defense couldn’t stand up to Alabama’s power running game and hasn’t faced Big Ten-level competition since. \nContact Tom Oates at toates@madison.com or 608-252-6172.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:03:07.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
