So Michigan State can reaffirm its status as one of the contenders for the national title with a convincing win this weekend. \nKEY MATCHUP \nMichigan State's offensive line vs. Purdue's defensive front. The Spartans came into the season believing their offensive line would be a strength, and although they still have plenty of talent up front, an injury to standout tackle Jack Conklin last week leaves the line looking a bit more vulnerable. Conklin's status is in question, with Dennis Finley ready to take his place if need be. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nPurdue: QB David Blough. In last week's loss to Bowling Green, Blough threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns and also ran for a score. The Boilermakers did not have an efficient day on the ground, and if that's the case again Saturday, Blough will need to beat the Spartans through the air. \nMichigan State: DL Shilique Calhoun. In an otherwise sluggish performance for Michigan State last week against Central Michigan, Calhoun was a force. He had 2 1/2 sacks and also blocked a field goal. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nMichigan State has scored at least 30 points for a school-record 12 consecutive games. That's the longest active streak in the FBS. . With a win Saturday, Connor Cook would become Michigan State's career leader with 28 victories as starting QB. He's currently tied with Kirk Cousins. . This is Purdue's first game against a team ranked in the AP top two since Oct. 23, 1999, when the Boilermakers lost to No. 2 Penn State 31-25. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:45:34.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
