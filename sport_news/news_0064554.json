The balance of the run game seemed to open things up on the outside for O’Connor.\nFor now, the focus is improving day in and day out for the Bulldogs, as they hope to finish the season at 11-1.\n“We are getting there,” Batchler said, “We are maybe a little ahead of where we were last year, and we were pretty good last season.”\nManasquan’s Parker Day ran for a 13-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.\nKey play: Mike O’Connor found Matt Vecchiarelli for an 18-yard touchdown pass to put the Bulldogs up 18-0 in the first quarter.\nOffensive game ball: Bryan Hess rushed for two touchdowns, including a 75-yard run in the first quarter.\nDefensive game ball : RFH’s Mike Ruane had two interceptions in the first half, including a pick six on the third play of the game.\nUp next: Rumson-Fair Haven will travel to Lakewood on Oct. 24, and Manasquan will host Matawan on Oct. 31.", "external_links": ["http://www.hudl.com/athlete/5282588/parker-day", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3531258/mike-oconnor", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3748351/mike-murdock", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3916083/bryan-hess", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/2789634/griffin-feinberg", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/4683349/chase-pfrang", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/4584183/elijah-mcallister", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3722232/mike-ruane", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3887429/matt-vecchiarelli"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:08:28.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
