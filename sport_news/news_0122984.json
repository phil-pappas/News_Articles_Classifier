The Indianapolis Colts helped the New England Patriots beat them Sunday night by running one of the most inexplicable, idiotic plays in National Football League history. And in case you couldn’t tell by watching the play, the ball was not supposed to be snapped.\nAdChoices Trailing 27-21 and facing a 4th-and-3 situation, Chuck Pagano called for a ridiculous formation that sent nine players out wide right. The Colts were clearly trying to confuse the Patriots, but they ended up confusing themselves. When Griff Whalen came to the sideline, you could see Pagano asking him why he snapped the ball.\nYou can see a video of the disastrous play here .\nAs if the play wasn’t already mind-blowing enough, Patriots broadcaster Scott Zolak said New England running back Brandon Bolden — who made the tackle — told him Colt Anderson was screaming at Whalen to not snap the ball.\nAgain, Bolden told me Anderson was screaming don't snap it! don't snap it!\n— Scott Zolak (@scottzolak) October 19, 2015\nSo why was the ball snapped? That remains as much of a mystery as Pagano trying to get cute when his team was only trailing by six.\nThe boneheaded play resulted in some fantastic memes, and we recommend you check them out . Personally, I think this further proves that Bill Belichick and the Patriots are so far in opposing teams’ heads that it helps them win games. Pagano obviously thought he had to try something absurd to beat New England at home.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/scottzolak/status/656141397788106753", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/colts-memes-fake-punt/278569"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:36:53.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
