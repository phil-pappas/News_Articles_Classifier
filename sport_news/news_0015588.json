It was a simple finish for Costa. \nThe striker next wanted a penalty when charging through between Kieran Richardson and Lescott, but referee Roger East ignored his appeal. \nThere was no reaction from a seated Mourinho, who is appealing against the Â£50,000 fine and suspended one-match stadium ban meted out by the Football Association after he said referees were \"afraid\" to give Chelsea a penalty in the wake of the Southampton loss. \nNemanja Matic was sent on at half-time for Loftus-Cheek and lasted longer than the 28 minutes he did as a half-time substitute against Southampton. \nFabregas was pushed further forwards and played a diagonal pass to Costa, who ran at Richards and Hutton before a shot ricocheted in off the Scot. \nCosta might have had his second but mis-timed his leap to meet a Fabregas cross. \nA Grealish foul on Cesar Azpilicueta prompted a frank exchange between coaches Rui Faria and Mark Robson, while Costa was involved in minor altercations with Richards and Ashley Westwood as the clock wound down in a welcome routine home win. \nTWEET OF THE MATCH \n\"In the relegation 6 pointer, Chelsea have gone ahead against Villa. Costa back in the goals.\" \n- Gary Lineker @GaryLineker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:12:46.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
