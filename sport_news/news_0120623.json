The Senators still have plenty of work to do and not all the news was good at the end of this night.\nWinger Clarke MacArthur left the game midway through the second after he collided with teammate Mark Fraser and Galchenyuk. MacArthur had a brief discussion with athletic therapist Gerry Townend and then went to the dressing room. He didn’t return and there is no timetable for how long he’ll be out.\nCoach Dave Cameron said the only move the club will make at this time is sending Fraser to Binghamton. Neither Shane Prince or Matt Puempel will be sent down because the Senators may need one or both if MacArthur is out for any length of time and that wasn’t clear.\n“It’s precautionary I have no update,” said Cameron.\nAs for their actual performance, the Senators weren’t pleased.\n“We’ve got to execute better, we’ve got to get more passes on the tape, we’ve got to make sure pucks get, we’ve got to be more crisp on the power play and there’s lots of aspects we’ve got to work on,” said Turris.\n“We wanted to treat tonight like the first regular-season game. Like I said, we were really sloppy and it was ugly hockey.”\nO’Connor had every right to be happy because there was no shortage of shots. Making his second pre-season start, he was pretty strong.\n“I felt like the team forced a lot of shots to the perimeter and allowed me to get my feet wet early on,” said O’Connor. “I felt in the zone with the adrenaline and home crowd. I felt good right off the bat.”\nWhat was amazing was how few opportunities the Senators were getting after being outshot 30-13 through 40 minutes, but still managed to lead 4-3. That’s partially because Tokarski wasn’t very good at all.\nStone ensured his club would have the lead after he held onto the puck just long enough to beat Tokarski on the stick side at 16:53. That’s two straight games where Stone has had a three-point effort against the Habs. He also had a goal and two assists in the club’s 5-2 win Thursday night in Montreal.\nAfter pulling out to a 3-1 lead in the first, the Senators couldn’t hold onto it.\nGallagher tied it up by deflecting a Tom Gilbert shot from the point by O’Connor at 11:02. The Habs started their comeback when Galchenyuk brought the club to within a goal by firing home a wrister at 7:18 on the power play.\nThe Senators pretty much picked up where they left off Thursday in Montreal in the first. They were outshot and badly outplayed, forcing O’Connor to make some big stops early, but Ottawa made the most of the few opportunities they had on Tokarski and had a 3-1 lead despite being outshot 19-8.\n“We didn’t play our best and execute the way we liked. (O’Connor) was able to hold us in there and we were able to get some timely goals,” said Stone.\nWideman scored his first of the pre-season by beating Tokarski through the five-hole at 17:04 to give Ottawa two-goal lead.\nOnly 19 seconds after Weise had tied it up 1-1 for the Habs on the power play, Hoffman, playing with Turris and Stone, gave the Senators a 2-1 lead on Ottawa’s third shot of the period. While Tokarski tried a poke check, Hoffman held onto the puck and put it home for his first goal of the pre-season at 9:36.Neil opened the scoring on the first shot at 4:43 of the first.\nCameron said there is a lot of work to do as the Senators get ready for the opener.\n“You never like to be outshot but it’s the quality of the shots. The upside of the last two games is we got a lot of practice playing in our own defensively. It’ll be good to start the year there,” said Cameron.\nTom Gilbert scored for the Habs in the mandated 3-on-3 OT at the end.\nTwitter: @sungarrioch\nOttawa Senators sweep Habs to end pre-season But Sens might have to play opener without MacArthur after forward suffers injury\nBy Bruce Garrioch , Ottawa Sun First posted: Saturday, October 03, 2015 09:53 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 03, 2015 10:54 PM EDT\nThe auditions ended Saturday night at the Canadian Tire Centre.\nThanks to some timely goal scoring, the Senators were able to close out their exhibition schedule with a second straight victory over the Montreal Canadiens to sweep the home-and-home series before the puck is dropped for real Thursday night against the Buffalo Sabres at the First Niagara Center.\nLed by a four-point night for Kyle Turris and three from Mark Stone along with goals from Cody Ceci, Chris Neil, Chris Wideman and Mike Hoffman, the Senators got a sparkling 33-save performance from Matt O’Connor to score a 5-4 victory over the Habs in front of 17,912 to close out the pre-season with a 3-3-2 record.\nMax Pacioretty, Brendan Gallagher, Alex Galchenyuk and Dale Weise scored for the Habs, who didn’t get much in the way of stops from Dustin Tokarski as the goalie faced only 15 shots from Ottawa.
