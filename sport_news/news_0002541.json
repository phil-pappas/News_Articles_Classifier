The former Yankees manager was vacationing with his wife in Italy at the time.\n\"It caught me off guard,\" Torre said. \"It's an honor to be considered for that, to be able to do it . . . It kept me up a lot [at night]. There are so many things that you wanted to talk about.\"\nTorre told a couple of Berra stories that evoked knowing laughs, such as when he told Torre he was recording a commercial for Amtrak when he meant Aflac.\n0:47 Yankees Yankees Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra dies \"He affected so many people in such a positive way,\" Torre said. \"The American treasure leaves behind a legacy of integrity, kindness and respect for all. Today we celebrate his amazing impact on others. We celebrate his uncanny ability to make people smile, even those who don't really care for baseball.\"\nBefore Torre spoke, the youngest of Berra's three sons, Dale, welcomed everyone and said, \"The last few weeks of my dad's life were spent kneeling in the on-deck circle of life\" before being called upon by God to join his team.\nCardinal Timothy Dolan of New York compared Berra to Pope Francis, whom he hosted in New York last week, noting their parents were from the same area of Italy. Dolan added: \"The smile, the open face, the innate courtesy, the aw-shucks attitude, the earthy grasp of heavenly and eternal values, even the big ears, are they not similar?\"\nDolan later evoked a couple of Yogi-isms in describing life's spiritual road, saying: \"We are on a journey back to Him for all eternity and there's no fork in the road on that journey, everybody, and that life ain't ever over.\"\nThe Yogi Berra Museum & Learning Center on the campus of Montclair State University will host a public memorial from noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.\nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s sports newsletter for stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js", "http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/1.0.0/handlebars.min.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=4x4&iu=/5819/cblvsn.nwsd.videogallery/sports&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url=/sports/baseball/yankees/yankees-hall-of-fame-catcher-yogi-berra-dies-1.10881010&correlator=1443811661673", "http://embed.sendtonews.com/player/sidebar.php?pkey=Wr18b6nt&width=300&cid=3547&sound=no&playlist=no&upnext=yes"], "published": "2015-09-30T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:48:08.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
