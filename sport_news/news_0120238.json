I’m sure those warmer feelings had something to do with the fact the Yanks usually got the best of the team from Missouri when it came to the postseason. \nAll of this is just prelude for something that’s become a little hard for me to comprehend: While I’ll always have an affinity for the Bronx Bombers, I find myself really liking the Royals these days. \nBefore you start to accuse me of jumping on a bandwagon, let me just lay out the facts for why I’ve started rooting for the guys from the City of Fountains. \nFirst, the contrarian point of view. \nI’ve now lived in Missouri for the better part of 27 years after spending my formative years in Iowa, so there’s an immersion factor at play. And while the common consensus would seem to be joining Cardinal Nation, that’s probably precisely why I didn’t. Those who know me are aware of my penchant for being a devil’s advocate, so falling in line with the legion of Cards fans was never an option. \nSecond, the underdog factor. \nWhile things are quite rosy now, for the bulk of my years in the Show-Me State, the Royals haven’t been much to write home about. (Or write columns about, if you prefer.) So they’ve been the living embodiment of the lovable loser, the scruffy dog who needs your love because nobody else was going to give it to them. \nThird, the financial factor. \nDespite being owned by someone who made his fortunes on the back of Walmart, the Royals have been reluctant to spend money for years and years. While this can be maddening for fans, in a way it helps make them easier to relate to. Most of us, especially these days, have to be aware of where our dollars and cents are going. So when you see somebody else trying to be fiscally responsible, it hits home. \nFourth, getting in on the ground floor. \nAs someone who has to follow the ins and outs of all the Missouri teams as part of his job, I was a vocal proponent when Glass hired Dayton Moore to be the general manager of the team in 2006. I was aware of his good work with the Atlanta Braves prior to his arrival in K.C. and thought he’d be the perfect guy for the job. It took awhile, but that’s proven to be correct, and it’s been fun to watch him turn around a team many thought would never be relevant again. \nFinally, old-school baseball. \nFor a good portion of the late ’90s and early 2000s, baseball became more and more about bulky sluggers and tape-measure home runs. It was even worse at the lower levels, where supercharged metal bats made multiple long balls and 16-12 scores way too commonplace. So this team, with its reliance on pitching, defense and stolen bases, is a comforting return to baseball of my youth. \nAnd yes, it has certainly helped the Royals become more palatable with their back-to-back trips to the World Series. I’m just going to sit back and enjoy the team’s renaissance for as long as it lasts. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:10:21.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
