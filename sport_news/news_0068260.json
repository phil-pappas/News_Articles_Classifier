Kane for Shaw Media) Minooka’s Ashley Tutt came in first place with a time of 17:41 to help lead the Indians to a first-place team finish at the IHSA Class 3A Minooka Regional on Saturday in Channahon Park in Channahon. By CURT HERRON cherron @shawmedia.com \nCHANNAHON – Minooka’s cross country program claimed its first sweep of girls and boys regionals since 2011 when it easily won both titles Saturday in its own Class 3A meet at Channahon Community Park. Related Links Paddock proud to host Chase opener \nCoach Kevin Gummerson’s girls team defeated Lincoln-Way Central, 22-62, for top honors and his boys squad prevailed, 40-69, over United Township for first place. As a result, both advance to next Saturday’s Normal Community Sectional. \nThe Indians also had the individual champion in each race, with Ashley Tutt taking first place in the opener and Soren Knudsen following that with a win in the finale. \nTutt (17:41) easily won the girls race, finishing 32 seconds ahead of teammate Mackenzie Callahan (18:13). Morgan Crouch (18:30) took third, Vivian Van Eck (18:35) was fourth and Katelyn Gall (19:33), Katelyn Egetimeier (19:38) and Emily Ellis (19:41) placed 12th to 14th. \n“Regionals are important, but we really want to be at our best at state,” Tutt said. “I feel like this year, since the summer, we’ve really come together since we all have the same goal. We’ve all been pushing each other since we all want a trophy. We just need to keep everyone healthy and work really hard these next two weeks.” \nThe Indians’ girls, who are ranked third in Class 3A, won easily despite not running one of their top individuals, Emily Shelton. As the lone senior regular on the team, Crouch is excited about what they might be able to accomplish during the next two weeks. \n“It’s been so exciting this year, especially since I’m a senior,” Crouch said. “We’re looking to do some big things at sectionals and at state. This team has been amazing this season by working together and the results are starting to come in, so that’s great. Even though we have a really young team, the dedication that everyone has put in is unbelievable.” \nThe Knights girls were led by Kelly Robbins (sixth, 18:59), Jenna Diers (eighth, 19:05), Madison Smith (ninth, 19:21), Gretchen Zirgaitis (11th, 19:28) and Dana Boucher (28th, 20:34). \nAlso advancing to the sectional were Providence Catholic’s Erynn Wakefield (30th, 20:42) and Savannah Baker (36th, 21:00). \nIn the boys race, Knudsen (15:32) trailed UT’s Kyle Riege and Dalton Martin during the late stages but made a big closing move to beat Riege by 13 seconds. \n“I knew that it wasn’t just going to be handed to me,” Knudsen said. “I knew that Kyle had some really good times, so I was just looking to key off of him. With about 1,200 meters to go, I felt comfortable so I just took it right there. I was feeling pretty good, but about four weeks ago, I got a bit of an injury. So I’m happy with where I’m at under the circumstances.” \nOther finishers for the Indians were Justin Tutt (fourth, 15:56), Miguel Lomeli (ninth, 16:06), Jordan Freese (12th, 16:20), Jack Sullivan (14th, 16:27), Ethan Milles (17th, 16:31) and Cody Hoshell (18th, 16:31). \n“Our goal coming in was to get a regional championship since we hadn’t won one in a few years,” Justin Tutt said. “The past two years have kind of been rebuilding ones for us but we’ve got some new kids who’ve stepped up, so it feels like we’re getting back in the game. All of us work hard and have so much determination. We’re striving to get back to state.” \nLincoln-Way Central took third with 96 points to also advance. Leading the Knights were Nathan Coppens (11th, 16:09), Nate Rittenbacher (13th, 16:25), Andrew Englert (22nd, 16:44), Zak Hutchinson (24th, 16:49) and Tony Brongiel (26th, 16:56).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:02:06.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
