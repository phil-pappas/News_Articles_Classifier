Lincoln College sweeps Carl Sandburg The Lincoln College volleyball team defeated the visiting Carl Sandburg College Chargers in straight sets Thursday: 25-17, 25-22 and 25-15.

That gives Lincoln College a 15-10 mark. ”Our block was solid all night long, which played a big role in our ability to stop Sandburg from gaining any momentum,” Lincoln College coach Mark Tippett said. “It is very satisfying to see the work our players have put in this season pay off with a strong start-to-finish performance like the one they gave tonight.” Lincoln College stats: Kenzie Cooper 8 kills, 5 points Katie Jordan 4 kills, 6 points Cassie Jennings 11 set assists, 5 points Gina Moore 2 kills, 3 digs Lauren Wendt 3 blocks, 12 points Ashley Robinson 6 points, 10 set assists Peyton Jones 3 kills, 6 blocks Kayla Dierker 8 digs Aira Hanson 5 kills, 3 blocks Brighton Robbins 13 digs, 7 points Lockenour visits state Lincoln senior golfer Rachel Lockenour posted a round of 104 at the Red Tail Run Golf Course in Decatur Friday in the first of two rounds of the IHSA Class 1A State Tournament.
