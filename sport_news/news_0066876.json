Cox, USA TODAY Sports Kelley L. Cox, USA TODAY Sports SACRAMENTO — There is, it turns out, a place that exists between uncomfortable and comfortable that is not the former but also not the latter.\nAdChoices LaMarcus Aldridge is there right now, somewhere on that path from Point A to Point B and hell-bent on getting there in this new life as a member of the San Antonio Spurs. And Thursday night at Sleep Train Arena, you see, was but a baby step.\nAfter working his way through the weirdness of it all — wearing an NBA jersey other than a Portland Trail Blazers for the first time since he entered the league in 2006 and having all that history come rushing back when he saw a recent Blazers-Sacramento Kings game on the Spurs’ locker room television before the game — the Spurs’ latest project went back to work on this tricky task.\nIt wasn’t about the numbers in San Antonio’s preseason-opening loss to the Kings, though for the sake of record-keeping he finished with eight points on 3-of-10 shooting with three rebounds in 23 minutes. On this night and the many more that are to come, this was about Aldridge learning to be his aggressive, ball-dominant self within the context of a system that has so long been known for its balance and selflessness.\nFor all of Aldridge’s accomplishments, this blending of styles has been a mental game of sorts for the four-time All-Star. It was one thing when coach Gregg Popovich and his crew told him during the free agency process in July that they didn’t want him to change, but it’s yet another still to put that plan into action. Truth be told, it will likely never be easier than it was in his opener because of who didn’t take part: No Popovich, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili or Boris Diaw, meaning Aldridge could conceivably have his run of the place.\n\"They’ve been trying to get me to (be aggressive), and now I’m just getting back to it because I didn’t want to come in being aggressive and then be too aggressive,\" Aldridge told USA TODAY. \"I think it’s better to be passive (at the beginning), and then kind of get into it more, so they’ve got me back to (thinking), 'You’ve got to still be yourself, but take the good pass and make the great pass,' and that’s what I’ve been doing.\n\"I think tonight showed that. They gave me the ball on the block a pretty good amount of times. I got pick-and-pops. I wasn’t making my shot tonight, or I probably would have got it more, but I don’t think I was overlooked tonight. I thought I got good shots all night.\"\nRest assured, there are some Spurs fans back in San Antonio who will remain skeptical of this marriage until the wins start piling up.\nWhile the Aldridge addition (along with David West and the re-signing of Danny Green) made the Spurs the offseason champions, the question of fit and whether he might be frustrated by the Spurs’ way was front and center during all that late-summer downtime when such answers are unattainable. Specifically, Aldridge’s honesty during an interview with USA TODAY Sports in July led to hours of scrutiny on a San Antonio sports talk radio show that includes former Spurs guard Antonio Daniels.\nThe center of the debate, it seemed, was this comment: \"So I was like, 'Maybe I’m not a Spur, because I’ve been averaging 23 (points per game) for the last three to four years, and maybe I don’t fit into y’all’s system of let’s all average 17 (points per game),\" Aldridge had admitted saying to the Spurs during the recruitment process.\nYet as his longtime friend and Spurs assistant coach Ime Udoka told him at the time, things have changed in San Antonio. The old heads like Duncan, Parker and Ginobili need help of his kind more than ever before, and he now finds himself leading the way alongside 24-year-old small forward Kawhi Leonard. That new dynamic, as they see it, has led to an opportunity that’s tailor-made for Aldridge.\n\"People told me that I’m not going to fit in because I’m ball-dominant, I’m a ball-stopper, so I’m not worried about that,\" Aldridge told USA TODAY Sports. \"I feel like if the Spurs didn’t feel like I fit in, then they wouldn’t have gotten me. I think the things that they wanted was someone who could play in pick-and-roll. I do that. Someone who could score on the block. I do that.\n\"I can make the extra pass, which I’ve done. I think every guy on the team would say that I’ve made the extra pass more than I have probably in my career. In my last practice, Pop told me to shoot it, because I wasn’t looking to shoot because I’m trying not to be that guy, so I made the extra pass.\"\nIf anything, Green said, Aldridge may need to work on being more selfish.\n\"Be aggressive, especially for LaMarcus,\" said Green, who has been with the Spurs since 2010 and signed a four-year, $45 million deal to return in July. \"He’s used to making his moves. He knows where guys are when he was in Portland, and now he’s still getting used to where the double-team is coming from and where guys are going to be at for his outlets. He’s not used to that yet.\n\"(Aldridge and West) are trying to adjust, but they’re adjusting very unselfishly. From my perspective, I think they should be more aggressive, and make us adjust around them. I tell them, 'Be aggressive, go make your move, and we’ll adjust to you guys’ games.' But that’s just them.\"\nBy comparison, West’s challenge should be a breeze. At 35 years old, having left $11 million behind in Indiana to sign a veteran’s minimum deal in San Antonio, he’s fully prepared to play whatever role they so desire. But Aldridge is still 30, with many years still ahead and no plans to lose his status as one of the game’s best. But the comfort, they’re convinced, will come.\n\"So far, I think he’s blending right in,\" Green said. \"Same high character, high quality guy, similar personality to a lot of guys here. Very laid back, very easygoing. Everybody here gets along, and I think that chemistry will continue to build and get better just like it was in the past. I don’t see any personalities here that will clash, so I think we’ll be good.\"\nFollow Sam Amick on Twitter @sam_amick .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/spurs/2015/08/24/lamarcus-aldridges-move-san-antonio-got-unlikely-assist/32211597/", "http://twitter.com/sam_amick", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:22:15.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
