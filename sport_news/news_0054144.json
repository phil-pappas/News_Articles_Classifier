The slugger had the injection on Thursday and was told not to participate in baseball activities for 24 hours, Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said. Cespedes was not at Friday's voluntary workout at Citi Field.\nMets manager Terry Collins says: \"We've got it taken care of. The doctors, they said, look, he'll be OK, and so tomorrow we'll find out.\" Collins said he didn't ask how Cespedes got hurt, adding: \"He didn't do it playing golf. He didn't have a bad sand shot or didn't get stuck in the side of a bunker. ... He either did it on a swing, or did it on a check swing or something else.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:02:58.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
