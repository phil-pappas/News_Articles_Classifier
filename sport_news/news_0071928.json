Austin Caffrey (29 carries) rushed for a career-high 359 yards and five touchdowns and Killingly ran over Bacon, 40-7, by totaling 480 yards on the ground, handing the Eastern Connecticut Conference’s last remaining unbeaten team its first loss. When Caffrey didn’t have the ball, Spencer Lockwood (23 carries, 120 yards) did. “I can have all my confidence in the running backs to make it through the holes, even when the holes are clogged,” Killingly left guard Conner Lemley said. “I can tell that they can make it through anything.” Lemley and his fellow offensive linemen — Collin Byrnes, Justin Lasher, Alex Fontaine and Josh Angel — controlled the line of scrimmage throughout. Once Caffrey got to the second level, the Bobcats found him almost impossible to bring down. “I think we were where we had to be, we just didn’t wrap up,” Bacon Academy coach Erik Larka said. “(Caffrey) made us miss, (Caffrey) ran us over. He’s a good running back.” The senior didn’t take long to leave an imprint on the game. After rushing for 20 yards on his first three carries of the Redmen’s opening drive, Caffrey broke free down the left sideline and raced 65 yards to the end zone. The Bobcats (4-1), who relied on the ECC’s best aerial attack to win their first four games, were sharp on their opening drive. Sean Kelly threw a 29-yard touchdown to Peter Kazibwe for the game’s first score. But Bacon struggled from that point forward. Kelly (14-for-33, 127 yards) threw a pair of interceptions (Chace Wood and Vasileios Politis) and the Bobcats punted twice over their final four drives of the half. Nothing slowed Killingly (3-1). Lockwood’s 15-yard TD run gave the Redmen their first lead early in the second quarter. Caffrey added a 29-yard score on Killingly’s next possession and then broke a 35-yard run to Bacon’s 23-yard line on the following drive. With Bacon’s coaches still yelling about Caffrey’s last run, Killingly quarterback Kyle Derosier snapped the ball and handed it to the senior again to go right up the middle. Page 2 of 2 - “Our linemen just opened up the hole so big and I saw that gap, and I just hit it as fast as I could,” Caffrey said. He ran between the hashes, untouched 23 yards to the end zone. With pressure mounting on the Bobcats sideline, the yelling continued and Bacon’s receivers dropped pass after pass as Bacon attempted to climb back into the game. “It was a perfect storm of not working out,” Larka said. “I have to watch the film, but we probably set a school record for most dropped passes. We drove the ball almost every drive and then dropped pass or penalty, dropped pass or penalty, so you can’t beat a good team when you can’t catch the ball and you’re a passing team.” Neal thought his team’s physicality played a factor in the Bacon mistakes. “The way our guys hit, I thought that set the tone. That led to some of those drops. Our linebackers can hit with anybody,” Neal said. That included Caffrey, who was all over field defensively. He added touchdown runs of 47 and 20 yards early in the fourth quarter. “We talked about it, it’s high noon and you know what happens at high noon, right?” Neal asked, referring to the game’s start time. “Somebody’s got to come out when the dust settles with a win and I’m proud of our guys for doing that (Saturday). It was a big win for our program.” By Brett Poirier The Bulletin The Bulletin By Brett Poirier The Bulletin Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 7:17 PM Updated at 9:59 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:51:33.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
