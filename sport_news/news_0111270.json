ECU defeated Tulsa Saturday, 30-17, and is 2-1 in the American Conference. Temple is unbeaten at 6-0 and 3-0 in the league. McNeill was very proud of the win over Tulsa and the way his defense harassed and hampered a powerful Golden Hurricane offense. “It was one of the best wins I’ve had as a head coach, period,” he said. “You saw the kids play and compete as a team, fight, scrap and play with no panic.” The Pirates held Tulsa to just 17 points and scored a defensive touchdown on a 100-yard pick-6 interception return by Josh Hawkins. Tulsa was averaging over 35 points per game coming into Saturday. “We knew we had to get after and affect an experienced quarterback in Dane (Evans of Tulsa),” McNeill said. “We had to have coverage changes and blitzes and a blend of both.” Temple presents a different challenge than the Golden Hurricane. The Owls are more run-oriented with the conference’s leading rusher in Jahad Thomas. He has run for 756 yards and 10 touchdowns on the year. Quarterback P.J. Walker has passed for 1,063 yards and eight scores. “They are a well-rounded team and deservedly in the Top 25,” McNeill said. “Their defense is one of the best in the conference and in the country.” Temple is a program that has risen quickly under head coach Matt Rhule. Rhule has them at 6-0 midway through the year in just his third season in Philadelphia. “Teams progress differently and it takes time to get your philosophy, players and staff in,” McNeill said. “They are in a definite ascending mode.” With this week’s game coming on Thursday night, the Pirates have to turn around and play just five days after their last outing, a task they have done before. McNeill says his focus this week is just keeping his guys as fresh as possible. “Making sure your players are fresh is big, but at the same time, it’s about quality not quantity,” he said. “That’s our thought process. Cloudy minds make slow legs and clear minds make fast legs.” Page 2 of 2 - ECU and Temple will kick off from Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium Thursday at 7 p.m. and will be televised on ESPN2.
