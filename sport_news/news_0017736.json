No. 18 ESU overcomes early deficit, knocks off No. 13 Pitt State By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 1 comment \nBrandon Gentz fell to the turf, partly in disbelief and partly in awe at what his No. 18 Emporia State football team accomplished. \nThe Hornets overcame a 14-0 deficit to knock off No. 13 Pittsburg State 46-42 at Welch Stadium Saturday afternoon. \nUpon a Pitt State fourth down pass attempt falling to the turf incomplete, Gentz went down with it to celebrate, as ESU was able to knee it out from there. \n“I couldn’t believe it,” Gentz, an Emporia native, said. “It was emotional. I had some tears falling. We just put in so much work and I couldn’t be more proud of a group of guys. I just love the hell out of these guys.” \nTo improve to 6-0, the Hornets got yet another career performance from quarterback Brent Wilson to go with ESU’s most forced turnovers (5) since a 2013 win against Missouri Western. Not to be forgotten was a fake field goal that set up the Hornets’ first score of the game. \n“It just tells you we have a lot of maturity as a program,” Wilson said of his team’s comeback win. “Against Central Missouri we were down 14-3, so this was a similar game. It just says a lot about our team, our coaching staff for staying calm and the maturity of our guys on both sides of the ball.” \nWilson’s day consisted of throwing for 336 yards and four touchdowns to one interception, running for a career-best and game-high 108 yards for another score, while also recovering from a potentially devastating turnover to lead the Hornets on a game-winning touchdown drive. \n“He played outstanding,” ESU head coach Garin Higgins said. “He just played the way a three-year starter should play. He made throws. He scrambled when he needed to. The thing that really impresses me about Brent is he never gets rattled.” \nA season-long 36-yard touchdown run from Wilson put ESU up 39-35 in the fourth quarter, and the Hornets’ Gabe Cleveland recovered a Pitt State fumble on the ensuing kickoff return. \nESU, which collected 559 yards of total offense, then moved the ball near the goal line, eventually facing a fourth-and-goal from the Gorillas’ 1. The worst case scenario for ESU occurred when, in an attempt to put the game away, Wilson fumbled the snap and Pitt State recovered it in the end zone to move the it out to the 20. \n“I take full responsibility for that,” Wilson said. “That could’ve really came back and haunted us.” \nPitt State went 80 yards in about three and a half minutes, scoring on a 2-yard run from John Roderique Jr. with 4:44 to play to take a 42-39 lead. \nWilson showed poise after the fumble, leading ESU down the field with his legs and right arm. The senior ran for 35 yards on the drive that ended with him connecting with Kavaski Ervin for a 14-yard pass across the middle of the end zone to reclaim the lead with 2:06 to play. \n“He’s the best in the country, in my opinion,” Gentz said of Wilson, who completed 26 of his 43 pass attempts. “I’ll go to war with him any day, and we got a lot of great playmakers over there helping him.” \nESU’s defense intercepted four of Roderique's passes — the Hornets’ most since picking off four passes twice in 2013. \n“We’ve dropped some in the past few games, and we just took advantage this game,” Gentz said. “We knew if we could get some pressure on them we’d have some opportunities. I think we’ve just started to gain more confidence back there in the secondary.” \nTre Dickerson intercepted two passes on the day, and Gentz laid out for one in the third quarter, which led to a 56-yard touchdown pass from Wilson to Jordan Reed to give ESU a 32-28 lead. \n“We just knew we had to stick together, be resilient, have each other’s backs” Gentz said. “I know if the defense is struggling, the offense has picked us up, and if the offense is struggling, the defense picks them up. So for us that’s big: being resilient, staying together and fighting until the end.” \nESU defensive end Dominique Jones tied for a team-high seven tackles and also accounted for the team’s other pick, taking the senior back to his days of playing tight end. \n“He threw it right to me…I had to catch it,” Jones said, laughing. “That was a gimme.” \nThe Hornets turned Jones’ interception in the third quarter into a 29-yard field goal from Austin Morton, who also hit a 36-yard attempt as the first half ended with ESU trailing 28-22. \nNine different Hornets caught a pass against Pitt State (4-2), with three of them pulling in a touchdown from Wilson. \nErvin led ESU with 88 yards on six catches and two touchdowns, his first score coming in the first half. He also helped set up ESU’s first score on a fake field goal when he slyly stood on the outside uncovered. Wilson, the holder, stood up and lobbed an easy throw to Ervin for 24 yards to the Pitt State 2, where Antonio Brown bulled in on the next play on a direct snap. \n“We just put it in this week,” Wilson said of the fake field goal. “We thought it would be a great way to start the game if we needed a field goal.” \nMitchell Foote recorded six catches for 53 yards that included a 4-yard touchdown grab, his sixth of the season, in the second quarter. \nThe win snapped Pitt State’s 22-game road win streak in the regular season, dating back to a 2010 loss at ESU. It was also the first win for ESU when trailing to start the fourth quarter since the same 2013 game against Missouri Western. \n“It was real emotional, real emotional,” Jones said. “But we’re a tough team. We’ve been through a lot, so we just take it one play at a time and that’s how we play. We can’t take anything for granted because there’s going to be ups and downs throughout the game, but we just got to stick it out and weather the storm.” \nPittsburg State (4-2) 14 14 7 7 – 42 \nEmporia State (6-0) 7 15 10 14 – 46 \nPSU — Swartz 17 pass from Roderique Jr. (Levin kick) \nPSU — Roderique Jr. 29 run (Levin kick) \nESU — Brown 2 run (Morton kick) \nPSU — Seybold Jr. 32 pass from Roderique Jr. (Levin kick) \nESU — Ervin 6 pass from Wilson (Morton kick no good) \nESU — Foote 4 pass from Wilson (2-point try no good) \nPSU — Copelin 29 pass from Roderique Jr. (Levin kick) \nESU — Morton 36 kick \nESU — Reed 56 pass from Wilson (Morton kick) \nPSU — Seybold 1 run (Levin kick) \nESU — Wilson 36 run (Morton kick) \nPSU — Roderique 2 run (Levin kick) \nESU — Ervin 14 pass from Wilson (Morton kick) \nGAME IN FIGURES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:48:45.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
