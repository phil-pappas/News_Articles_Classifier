(AP) -- Kentucky State has promoted Darnell Williams to head coach after three seasons as Antwain Banks' assistant. \nWilliams takes over a Thorobreds team that went 9-18 last season after going a combined 30-26 the previous two years. He expressed confidence in getting a young and undersized KSU squad back to its winning ways, saying Monday in a release, \"my goal is for this to be not only one of the most well-conditioned teams, but one of the most disciplined teams, both offensively and defensively.\" \nWilliams surpassed 1,000 points and earned all-Atlantic 10 Conference and honorable mention All-American selections during his career at Xavier from 1995-99. He tried out with the NBA's Sacramento Kings and played professionally in the U.S. and overseas through 2005. Related Stories Get This \nSEX TIPS-UNIVERSITY \nMADISON, Wis.
