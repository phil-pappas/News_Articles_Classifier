Senior quarterback Matthew Mazurkiewicz (6-of-14 for 109 yards) also contributed with two touchdown passes from 9 and 3 yards. \nThe Wildcats did get on the board in the second quarter when Lovelle Houston (10 carries for 30 yards) got past the goal line on a 5-yard run. Central also was able to put up two late touchdowns, but they were not nearly enough. \n“The seniors played well and they didn’t quit on me,\" Central coach John Jackson said. \"I’m proud of the seniors and I hope they have a good career in whatever they’re going to do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:30:04.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
