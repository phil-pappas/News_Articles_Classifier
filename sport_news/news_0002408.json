(AP) â€” A western Pennsylvania youth football league has canceled the rest of it season after receiving a disturbing threat: bullets with the names of league officials written on them. \nPolice haven't charged anyone with leaving the bullets at the gate of the field used by the Mount Pleasant Area Junior Football League on Tuesday. \nParents tell reporters that some parents were arguing about various issues earlier in the season and that one game already had to be canceled because of threats. \nThe league sent a letter to parents saying the cancellation is happening \"with the advice of the state police, FBI, school administration and league officials.\" \nThe league, and others like it throughout western Pennsylvania, serves as a feeder system to its school district. Mount Pleasant is about 35 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
