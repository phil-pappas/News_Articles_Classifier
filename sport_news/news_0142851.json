Inside the UCLA women’s volleyball team was warming up off to the side of the gym and practice was over for the day for the Raptors, but head coach Dwane Casey was not happy. \nThe focus his team showed through much of training camp disappeared and Casey wasn’t about to let that go unnoticed. \n“Today was a tough practice just because there are a lot of distractions with a different gym,” Casey said. “I don’t know if we got a lot out of today but there’s a lot we got to pick up. I don’t know if we got caught up in LA or whatever but we have to get our focus back in training camp mode.” \nCasey, though, also wanted to clear up a little misconception about the defensive scheme changes he has made this year. \nThrough camp it has been reported that it’s being done primarily to keep Jonas Valanciunas closer to the basket and out of the high pick and roll defensive coverage. \nCasey says the intent was never about making those changes to help Valanciunas. They are being made to help the whole team. \n“The key is all of our bigs have to go and get the ball,” he said. “All of them have to focus on rebounding. We are not changing our defence for one guy. We are changing it to make sure we take advantage of an offensive system and all of our big guys have to go and rebound.” \nValanciunas is averaging 11 rebounds in about 21:45 this pre-season. For the season last year he average 8.7 over 26.2 minutes. \nHAYES CHECKS IN \nKyle Lowry is back, slimmed down but just as feisty as ever and looking to get his team over the hump. \nIn essence he’s already done that once helping them get back to the playoffs two years ago after an five-year absence. They were back again a year later, only this time they fell flat on their collective faces, bowing out in four straight games to the Washington Wizards. \nNow the barrier to overcome is that first-round playoff win. \nLowry was as guilty as anyone in the collapse against Washington and has come back radically physically altered to take another run at it. \nGood friend and former teammate Chuck Hayes has certainly noticed the difference. \nHayes is now with the Los Angeles Clippers and having been through that collapse with Lowry last spring knows exactly how the Raptors point guard felt about it. \n“He was hot,” Hayes said. “He was more upset that he was having an all-star year and it ended like that. And he knows he didn’t play well. As you can see he re-dedicated himself to his body. He even grew out his hair a little bit. Obviously that four-game sweep really did motivate him to come back with the attitude he has now.” \nHayes made that assessment before Lowry went off for 26 points in 21 minutes in the win in Vancouver against his Clippers. \nROOK GETS SOME LOVE \nThe Raptors practice at UCLA’s Wooden Recreation and Sports Complex drew a handful of curious onlookers. But it wasn’t until after the practice with the team walking through campus on their way back to the bus that heads really started to turn. \nDeMarre Carroll and UCLA alum Norman Powell seemed to attract the most attention with a large group trailing them/walking with them back to the bus. When Carroll stopped to chat the group broke into two, half staying with the tenacious Carroll and the other half trailing the rookie Powell. \nOLD HAT NOW \nGoing into his seventh year in the NBA, the excitement about playing at home has mostly worn off for DeMar DeRozan. \nThe Compton native is always happy to get on the court against one of his basketball hero’s Kobe Bryant, but playing in front of the home fans — it won’t be the Staples Centre this time but out in Ontario, Calif., for this pre-season exhibition with the Lakers — has lost some of its lustre over the years. \n“Not like I used to,” DeRozan said of anticipating another game close to home “Now I treat it like another game. It’s kind of different now. I really don’t pay attention to all the tickets and stuff. As long as my daughter is at the game and my parents are there, that’s all I worry about. Everything else I don’t even pay attention to.” \nQUICK HITS \nTonight’s game will be played at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario Calif. The Raps will take on the Los Angeles Lakers at 10 p.m. EST. The Lakers are just back from a two-game exhibition series in Honolulu with the Utah Jaz and now boast reigning NBA Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams, who won the award while playing for the Raptors last year. Citizens Business Bank Arena is home to the Ontario Reign, the LA Kings AHL farm club and the Ontario Fury of the Major Arena Soccer League. The Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA D-League have also played there on occasion. It seats just under 11,000 for basketball.
