REX WOLF/SPECIAL TO THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL Coach Craig Schurig By Rick Peterson Jr. richard.peterson@cjonline.com \nNeeding a spark to prevent Central Missouri from pulling away, Washburn created turnovers on three different occasions to swing the momentum to the Ichabods. \nEach time, Washburn’s offense did literally nothing to capitalize. \nThe Bods failed to put up points off any of the turnovers they forced, as the Mules continued to protect a comfortable lead before sealing up a 38-28 win Saturday at Yager Stadium. \nWashburn linebacker Alec Steuber forced two fumbles, and the Ichabods also recovered a muffed punt. But WU couldn’t take advantage of great field position after the turnovers. Washburn (3-3, 3-3 MIAA) missed field goals from 34 and 36 yards and also had an interception in Mules’ territory, wasting the opportunities. \n“As bad as we played, in the second half we got a couple turnovers and we got all the momentum, and we don’t do a damn thing with it,” Washburn coach Craig Schurig said. “It’s just really frustrating. \n“You got to capitalize. You get those short fields and you come up with no points. We could never dig into the lead. Just a few points there and we can get right back in it.” \nWashburn’s last chance to get within striking distance came after the Ichabods recovered the muffed punt at Central’s 21-yard line. WU gained just two yards before freshman Perry Schmiedeler missed from 36 yards. \n“When the defense made plays and made turnovers, the offense didn’t capitalize,” WU receiver Bryce Chavis said. “We need to take it upon ourselves to finish better. It’s been kind of the story of every loss this year. We’ve had chances but we’re not finishing and we got to get better at that.” \nCentral Missouri (4-2, 4-2) led 24-14 at halftime and never let Washburn get closer than 10 in the second half. A 3-yard run from Markel Smith put the Mules up 38-21 with 10:24 left. \nWashburn put up 407 yards, but struggled to complete drives. \n“There were points when we were really executing and really playing well,” Chavis said. “We just kept stalling out. Really, a good team finishes drives, and we have to finish drives if we want to be the great team that we can be.” \nWith Central Missouri gearing up to stop the run, Washburn was content to air it out. WU quarterback Derek McGinnis completed 22 of 50 passes for 264 yards with three touchdowns and one interception. \n“We just seemed like we were a little off,” Schurig said. “They were another team that centered around the ball and tried prevent the run game, so you have to take advantage of some big plays in the pass game. We just didn’t do it when we needed to. \n“Again, the second half was better. We gave ourselves a chance. The defense really provided a spark and so did the special teams. But we just couldn’t get back into the game.” \nAnthony Daniels scored Washburn’s first and last touchdown passes on receptions of 34 and 30 yards. Jake Horner also hauled in a 26-yard pass for his first career touchdown reception. \nChavis finished with eight receptions for 81 yards, while Hayden Groves rushed for 74 yards on 14 carries for the Ichabods. \nSteuber recorded six tackles, including two for loss, with two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. WU sophomore safety Peter Pfannenstiel logged a career-high 15 tackles. \nUCM quarterback Garrett Fugate led the Mules with 295 yards passing and 72 on the ground while Mules’ receiver Jaylen Zachary caught seven passes for 107 yards. \n“We can play so much better, that’s what is so frustrating,” Schurig said. “We’re not even close to our potential. That’s the thing that hurts.” \nCentral Mo. (4-2, 4-2) 7 17 7 7 — 38 \nWashburn (3-3, 3-3) 7 7 7 7 — 28 \nFIRST QUARTER \nWU — Daniels 34 pass from McGinnis (Schmiedeler kick), 7:30.
