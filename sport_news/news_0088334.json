Russell will see a specialist this week, the school said. \nNo further information was immediately available about the specific injury or any timetable for a return. \nIn his first season as a full-time starter, Russell guided Baylor to just its third 7-0 start in school history and a 4-0 Big 12 record. Many analysts had suggested Baylor was playing as well as any team in the country, with Russell one of the key reasons. \nThe Bears had scored 60 points in a national record-tying five straight games before Saturday. Russell entered this weekend as the passing efficiency leader in the Football Bowl Subdivision, directing an offense that leads the nation in scoring, total offense and yards per play. \nBaylor's next game is a Thursday night road game at Kansas State on Nov. 5. If Russell cannot play, freshman Jarrett Stidham would move into the starting spot. \nEven before the news was announced, coach Art Briles seemed worried about Russell. \n\"First and foremost, it's about his health and then football,\" Briles said. \"He's a tough guy, and it's hard to see tough guys hurt.\" \nRussell was hurt on a 4-yard run during the fourth quarter with Baylor up 35-20. Briles said Russell would not have been able to continue. Facing a fourth-and-one, Briles opted for a 34-yard field goal by Chris Callahan to give Baylor a three-score lead again. \nHow good has Russell been directing the offense? \nBaylor players sound frustrated and apologetic on Saturday after an 18-point victory in which they led 35-0 in the first half. With two touchdown passes and another rushing, Russell has accounted for 35 TDs this season. \nShock Linwood, who ran for 171 yards and joined Walter Abercrombie as the only 3,000-yard rushers in Baylor history, was hoping for the best. \n\"I'm concerned because that's my No. 1 quarterback,\" Linwood said. \"So I'll just say whenever they look at him later on tonight or tomorrow, we'll see what's wrong with him. And hope we correct that.\" \nFormer Baylor quarterback Bryce Petty, now with the New York Jets, missed just one game last season with two cracked transverse processes in his back. Russell's injury seems potentially far more serious. \nIf Russell is sidelined for an extended period of time, Stidham would step into the starter role. \nHe's not a normal freshman. As a senior at Stephenville High School, Stidham was ranked as the top dual-threat prospect by 247Sports and second by ESPN. Originally a Texas Tech commit, he changed to Baylor late in the process. \nIn limited playing time after games have been decided, he has completed 24 of 28 passes for 331 yards and six touchdowns. His passing efficiency rating of 255.7 is actually higher than Russell's total of 189.7. \nEarlier this month, Briles had talked about the importance of Stidham playing early. \n\"It just accelerates his process,\" Briles told Waco Herald-Tribune. \"Stidham is so far along mentally and physically and in maturity, so he's ready to go. He's going to be on a fast track.\" \nTwitter: @ChuckCarltonDMN IN THE KNOW \nJarrett Stidham \nBreaking down Baylor freshman quarterback Jarrett Stidham, who could step into the starting position if injured Seth Russell is not available: \nYear: Freshman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:30:33.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
