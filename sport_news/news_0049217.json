Those with roster space in 10- and 12-team leagues may want to consider adding Mark Sanchez and stashing him away, just in case . . . Yes, the Chargers gave up 356 yards and two TDs to Josh McCown last week, but please avoid the temptation to play Michael Vick against San Diego this week. Took a bunch of questions in yesterday's chat from folks who are considering him ahead of guys like Eli Manning and even Derek Carr. \nRunning back: Christine Michael is the No. 3 running back in Dallas now that Lance Dunbar (knee) is done for the season. Earlier this week, Cowboys coach Jason Garrett affirmed that Joseph Randle was the No. 1 guy. Handle Randle with care. If the Patriots, the Cowboys' opponent this week, run out to a big lead, it's feasible Dallas will work Michael in to see what they have in him . . . Of the 146 yards Todd Gurley ran for against Arizona last week, 106 came in the fourth quarter. Think the Rams want to establish the run this week at Green Bay? Gurley's an RB1. \nWide receiver: Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) is trending toward getting back in the lineup for the first time since Week 1. The Bears are at the Chiefs, which seems like a tasty matchup given that KC has given up a league-worst 10 TD passes. But five of those were at Green Bay where everybody gets torched. Consider Jeffery a WR2 if he plays . . . Steve Smith's back injury, which includes (yeesh) four microfractures, has made Kamar Aiken a popular pickup this week. In the last three games, Aiken has five, zero and five catches respectively . . . DeSean Jackson's impending return from a hamstring injury (either this week or next) probably hurts Washington rookie Jamison Crowder, who has seen 18 targets over the last two weeks, including 12 against the Eagles on Sunday. Keep an eye on Crowder should Jackson have any setbacks. Week 5 rankings \n1. Aaron Rodgers, Packers: vs. Stl \n2. Peyton Manning, Broncos: at Oak. \n3. Tom Brady, Patriots: at Dal. \n4.
