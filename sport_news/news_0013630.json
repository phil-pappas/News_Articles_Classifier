Ouch. That puts us at 11-14 overall and in the bottom third of the 1727 participants, our work certainly cut out for us. \nThe top consensus plays ended up at 2-2-1 after Cincinnati -3 was able to push in their game against the Seahawks. New England and Arizona were easy winners while the Giants failed to cover through in their comeback victory. The Texans were the other loser, many using that game simply because of the locked in, bargain price of minus-1 with Houston. That Thursday nighter closed at Houston -5 when it was announced that Luck would miss his second consecutive game. Indy’s win had the strategy blowing up on 427 entries, ours included. On the season, consensus plays now stand at a stellar 17-7-1 through five weeks. \nTwo teams are tied for the overall lead in the contest, having scored 21 covers in 25 attempts. One of them, a team called EJOC had a 4-1 week when the Titans, Redskins, Eagles and Cardinals all cashed in while the Rams failed to do so. The other leader that goes by the name TD Love Machine went a perfect 5-0 in Week 5 with the Titans, Eagles, Browns, Redskins and 49ers all coming through. Of course, all selections in the Westgate SuperContest are made against the pointspread. \nODDS AND ENDS \nMany wonder what sport has the biggest handle when it comes to North American sports. Any bookmaker will tell you that it’s not even close. The NFL rules and to illustrate, Scott K., sportsbook director at thegreek.com explains that “our lowest handle of the day was on the Jacksonville-Tampa Bay game. Even so, neither of the American League Division Final games came within 30% of our take on the Jag/Bucs game.” \n- Three of the 12 games played on Sunday ended up in overtime but there was little effect on the pointspread or totals on any of them. The Browns were covered as a six-point dog before upsetting the Ravens. Atlanta’s overtime touchdown still did not allow for a cover as the Falcons winning by six as a seven-point choice, the game staying under 48 even with the OT touchdown. Cincinnati’s comeback win ended up a push as the Bengals were favoured by a field goal in a 27-24 win, surpassing the 44 point total in regulation when tied at 24-24. \n- Survivor poolies who used the Chiefs this week are less than pleased with the underachieving club. At home and leading the Bears 17-6 with just over three minutes to play, Kansas City not only looked like a cinch to win the game but bettors who spotted nine points were also hopeful of a cover. Neither happened as QB Jay Culter led his mates on two scoring drives and an eventual 18-17 upset. \n- While the Bills-Titans game was not the most heavily bet game of the afternoon, that game offered a rewarding opportunity for those savvy enough to spot it. The Bills were as much as a three-point favourite when the lines first came out early in the week. By game time, depending on where you shop, the Titans had become a one-point pick. That is known as a middle as sharp bettors were able to take three-points with Tennessee and then take one point with the Bills as kickoff neared. With a middle, you cannot lose both bets but if the game falls in the ‘middle’ of the two pointspread, both bets are winners. With Buffalo ultimately winning by one point, that’s exactly what happened, making a select few extremely happy. \n- Five weeks completed and we find six teams that are undefeated. That’s a record number since the league introduced bye weeks back in 1990. Not only are the Broncos, Falcons, Packers, Bengals, Panthers and Patriots all without a loss, but they’ve also been money makers, collectively going 23-4-1 versus the spread.
