Ovechkin said Trotz then told the team captain he would not play in the game for violating team rules. \n\"I just messed up with my alarm clock ... made a mistake,\" Ovechkin said. \"We talked. We have a conversation. It's [the] rules.\" \nTrotz said he understood what happened, but the rules are the rules. \n\"It was an honest mistake,\" Trotz said. \"But we have certain accountability rules, and everyone's accountable in that room.\" \nFLYERS 3, BLACKHAWKS 0 (at Philadelphia) — Michal Neuvirth made 30 saves to black Chicago. \nSam Gagner and Claude Giroux scored second-period goals to make it 2-0. \nMatt Reed capped the scoring with 2:35 remaining in the game. \nSENATORS 7, BLUE JACKETS 3 (at Columbus) — Bobby Ryan, Mika Zibanejad and Kyle Turris each had a goal and an assist, Erik Karlsson added a career-high four assists for Ottawa. \nMarc Methot, Milan Michalek, Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Mike Hoffman also scored to help Ottawa improve to 3-0-0 on the road for the first time since 2007-08. Ryan Stone had two assists and Craig Anderson made 37 saves.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:52:14.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
