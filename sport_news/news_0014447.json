RUSSOAP College Football Writer \nHalfway through the college football season the contenders have become fairly clear and the most meaningful games are pretty easy to spot. \nOf the top 11 teams in the latest Associated Press college football poll, 10 play each other in upcoming regular season games. \nNo. 5 LSU is at No. 8 Alabama on Nov. 7. No. 9 Florida State also plays at No. 6 Clemson that day. On Nov. 21, No. 7 Michigan State is at No. 1 Ohio State. No. 2 Baylor is at No. 4 TCU the day after Thanksgiving and No. 11 Notre Dame is at No. 10 Stanford that Saturday. \nThere will be upsets, no doubt. Other games have potential to shake-up the College Football Playoff race and other teams will no doubt be in contention. But there is also a good chance the winners of those games will comprise most if not all of the final four. \nThis is also the point in the season where most teams have built up enough of a resume that ranking teams on one or two big wins doesn't quite fly. A team can show itself to be very good even if its competition isn't. The AP voters have had their say. Time to heat check their work, but remember: This stuff will work itself out. \nNo. 1 Ohio State (7-0) \nWhen the Buckeyes don't turn the ball over and convert their red-zone trips into touchdowns, they are that unstoppable team they were expected to be this season. Still might be the best team in the country. Still looking for that centerpiece victory. \nNext: at Rutgers. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 2 Baylor (6-0) \nIf it was this easy to score 60 every week, other teams would do it. But we reserve the right to be a little skeptical. \nNext: Iowa State. Smells like another 60. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 3 Utah (6-0) \nAgainst one of the tougher schedules in the country so far, the Utes are unbeaten. It might feel weird to vote them No. 1 but it would be the right thing to do. \nNext: at USC. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 4 TCU (7-0) \nThe Horned Frogs have played only three games at home and outscored the opposition 176-51 there. \nNext: West Virginia. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 5 LSU (6-0) \nQB Brandon Harris and the passing game are coming around. But the Tigers have played only two road games \nNext: Western Kentucky. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 6 Clemson (6-0) \nThe Tigers have dusted a couple of inferior conference foes the last two weeks at home. That's what big-time teams do. The resume win against Notre Dame makes up for the lack of road credentials. \nNext: at Miami. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 7 Michigan State (7-0) \nSo this is weird: The Spartans played one of their best games of the season at Michigan and had they lost Heat Check would have endorsed not dropping them far. That they won in such a bizarre manner leaves Heat Check reluctant to reward Michigan State too much. Voters seemed to have had a similar reaction and left the Spartans right where they were. \nNext: Indiana. \nHeat check: Just right. \nNo. 8 Alabama (6-1) \nMake it two convincing road wins. Similar to Ohio State in that the talent makes it easy to overlook the flaws. In the Tide's case, the flaw is a home loss to an Ole Miss team that hasn't played well since beating 'Bama. \nNext: Tennessee. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 9 Florida State (6-0) \nThe Seminoles' resume is lackluster, like Ohio State's, but they seem to be getting better. By the way, Everett Golson has zero interceptions. How about that? \nNext: at Georgia Tech. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 10 Stanford (5-1) \nNorthwestern over Stanford is becoming 2015's Virginia Tech over Ohio State. Christian McCaffrey and the Cardinal are crushing foes. \nNext: Washington. \nNo. 11 Notre Dame (6-1) \nNo team has a better loss and the Irish have flashed dominance in their wins. \nNext: Temple, Oct. 31. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 12 Iowa (7-0) \nThe Hawkeyes are the classic example of a good team that catches a couple of breaks early, gains confidence and now thinks it's better than it is. That's a good thing. They played their best game against Northwestern, beating the heck out of the team that beat Stanford. Heat check is starting to warm up to Iowa ... a little. \nNext: Maryland, Oct. 31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:23:18.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
