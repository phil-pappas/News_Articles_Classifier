The team is 1-4 after a 50-7 loss against TCU, and players are currently sniping at one another via the media and on Twitter . There are fires raging all over the Texas program right now, but apparently not on Charlie Strong's seat.\nAccording to a report from ESPN.com's Joe Schad , Strong still has plenty of support in Austin from school officials and booster.\n\"Charlie has a lot of breathing room,\" according to the report. \"There is nowhere near the pressure to remove him at this time that there was with Steve Patterson or even Mack Brown.\n\"Charlie has the support of the people he needs to be supported by right now. The last thing they want to do is make a change.\"\nTexas has already seen plenty of changes within the athletic department this season, as the man who hired Strong, Steve Patterson, was relieved of his duties as athletic director in September. Interim athletic director Mike Perrin reportedly isn't looking to make any other major changes, and Strong is well-liked by those in the administration that matter.\nAnd that's a good thing. \nThere are a lot of things going wrong with Texas football these days, but I'm not sure any of them are Strong's fault. It's only his second season with the Longhorns, and any coach should be given at least three seasons to make progress before the possibility of being fired.\nStill, with all that said, as I wrote on Saturday , there have been plenty of times when logic and common sense don't really mean anything when it comes to coaching decisions. Hopefully cooler heads will prevail in Austin, and Strong will be given more time to put out the fires raging around him.\nCharlie Strong's job doesn't seem to be in danger at Texas.
