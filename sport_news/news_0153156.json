Under Armour, the Baltimore-based sportswear company, agreed about three months ago to pay for synthetic soccer fields at two Portland parks in exchange for displaying the company's logos. City Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who oversees parks, and Mayor Charlie Hales celebrated the agreement, which would bring needed investment to Lents Park in East Portland and Duniway Park in Southwest Portland, next to the building that will house Under Armour's new Portland office .\nProblem is, that ruffled the feathers of a certain local sportswear giant, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive's Brad Schmidt. To be fair, Nike is the one who installed a track made out of recycled sneakers at Duniway Park back in 1995, when Under Armour was just an idea in the mind of its founder, Kevin Plank, then a special teams captain for the University of Maryland football team. The Nike swoosh has remained on the scoreboard long after Nike's original sponsorship deal expired, as Willamette Week noted.\nWhile Nike is much larger than Under Armour, the two are locked in fierce competition for market share, athletes to wear their gear and even employees, now that Under Armour is basing some operations in Portland.\nIt all was enough to make Hales, who incidentally is running for re-election, uncomfortable about annoying Nike, which incidentally donated $2,000 to Hales after his last election.\nSo, Hales suggested a do-over . He asked Fritz to put the deal before the City Council as a whole to vote on rather than authorize it on her own as the parks commissioner. Fritz, however, turned down his request . While Nike might not be happy with the decision, Fritz wrote in an email , she believes \"it is the most ethical choice, honoring both corporations and also park users.\"\n\"I take full responsibility for this decision. I will shoulder 'whatever disgruntlement might attach to' my choice,\" she wrote in her email, quoting Hales' message.\nUnder Armour's $5.5 million donation is a boost for a parks system with about a half billion dollars worth of needs, she said. But Nike can take comfort in one change: You won't see the Under Armour logo all over the place, after all, as Fritz decided it was best that the donation be made \"without recognition\" and that the parks belong to the people, not to corporations.\nA good compromise, in the end, from someone whose views don't change with the political season.\nValley\nIn the rough at the coast: The withdrawal by Chicago-based golf developer Mike Keiser of his plan to build a new course on state-owned land along Oregon's coast is a disappointment.\nThe project had its complications: the sale of dunes land given to the state by a federal agency that had insisted use of the land forever be for the public's benefit, a nonprofit operating plan that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management wanted to restructure, pushback by some folks concerned with environmental protections.\nBut the proposed golf course – a downscaled companion to Keiser's celebrated but pricey Bandon Dunes Resort 15 miles to the north – would have functioned as a municipal facility, expanding access to local golfers while providing a much-needed jolt to the south coast economy. Bandon Muni, as Kaiser had referred to it, would have opened gorse-covered land at Bandon State Natural Area to wider public access in such a way that posed no threat to nearby beach-nesting snowy plovers, a federally protected species resurging in number since 2000.\nKeiser's spotless development record in Oregon suffered with the recent disclosure his workers reportedly had, without notifying state officials, entered the site of the proposed golf course to cut trees and roads. That alone is a disturbance in need of full review by the Oregon Parks Department.\nBut the inability by Keiser to make the land purchase and change his plan of operations following federal review is a deeper disturbance in need of examination. Few such projects come along that match the will of so many locals, not to mention elected officials: to honor and protect the contour of wildlands and expand the public's benefit in their use while creating economic activity.\n— The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:38:38.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
