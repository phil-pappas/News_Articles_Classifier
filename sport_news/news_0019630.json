The couple was facing a maximum of 30 years in prison — 15 years for each death.\nJose Encinias\nDistrict Court Judge Abigail Aragon accepted the plea deal on charges of negligence of a resident resulting in death last Thursday. A sentencing date has not yet been set.\n“Mr. Encinias, in our opinion, was more culpable in that he was the one who switched out the gas line that ultimately led to their deaths,” Flores said, adding that the families of both men who died in the storage shed agreed to the deal. “By the same token, I had to take into account that this was not an intentional death.”\nThe day Chocise Bayham, 56, and Alex Montoya, 61, were released from the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute in Las Vegas, the men took up board in a recently purchased 12 feet by 32 feet garden shed in the Encinias’ backyard. Bayham and Montoya were paying a total of $1,100 a month in rent and for caretaker services when they died.\nDenise Encinias\nFlores said he’ll have more to say about the case after sentencing. Boarding people released from the state’s only mental health facility has become a commonplace cottage industry in the Las Vegas area.\n“The more I’ve looked into the case, the more I’d like to make a strong statement regarding mental health. This area needs to be looked at more and possible regulation,” the DA said.\nAlex Montoya\n“Something needs to be done. There are too many individuals who are given meds and then the gate is opened and they are out there. There’s a lot of potential for incidents like this to happen.”\nAlbuquerque attorney Rafael Padilla, who represented the Encinias couple, did not return phone messages from the Journal.\nCochise Bayhan\nWhen the electric heater the Encinias’ provided in the shed proved to be inadequate, Jose Encinias installed a propane-fed heater and draped the inside of the shed with plastic as insulation. Three days later, Bayhem and Montoya, who both suffered from schizophrenia and had been in and out of the state’s only mental health hospital many times, were found dead.\nAutopsy reports deemed the deaths were caused by “the toxic effects of carbon monoxide,” with concentrations in both men well above generally accepted fatal amounts. Building inspectors found 27 construction code violations with the shed, 11 of them gas code violations.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20140411019-175x175.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20140411016-134x175.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20140411017-640x480.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20140411018-640x480.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:42:08.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
