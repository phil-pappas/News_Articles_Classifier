Log in and start commenting \nJackett will still consider a move into the loan market for a centre-back to cover the gap but hinted he may now hold back, unless anything happens to his first-choice pair. \n“We have to be aware of what centre-backs are in the market and who we could get quickly if one of our first-choice centre-backs was injured,” said the head coach. \n“Being aware of exactly what is out there and what we can do very quickly is the most important thing. \n“Should we need to move at least we know we have the type of player who can come in, whether it be short-term or long-term to help our team.” \nSurgery would have kept Ebanks-Landell sidelined for between 12 and 15 weeks. \n“Having visited the consultant, it is the better of the two potential scenarios for Ethan in that the fracture is considered small enough not to require surgery,” said the club’s head of medical Phil Hayward. \n“We will carefully manage the recovery process which will initially involve reducing the amount of load the bone is exposed to, but if all goes well he is expected to be on the sidelines for between four and six weeks.” Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
