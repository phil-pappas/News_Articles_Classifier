(AP) â€” Ross Martin kicked three field goals to help Duke beat Boston College 9-7 on Saturday.\nThomas Sirk passed for 195 yards for the Blue Devils (4-1, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), who won their first two league games for the third time in the last 34 years.\nDuke has started 4-1 or better through five games in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1962-65.\nBoston College had two good opportunities to take the lead late in the fourth quarter.\nColton Lichtenberg's 45-yard field-goal attempt with 3:35 remaining came up short, and Jeff Smith's fourth-down completion to David Dudeck at the Duke 43-yard line was short of the first down with 2:16 left.\nTroy Flutie passed for 129 yards for Boston College (3-2, 0-2).\nFlutie accounted for the game's lone touchdown with a 66-yard pass to Thadd Smith late in the third quarter.\nMartin kicked field goals of 36, 38 and 53 yards in the first half to give the Blue Devils a 9-0 halftime lead. His 53-yarder with 3:40 remaining in the second quarter tied a career long.\nDuke won despite struggling to run against Boston College, which entered the game with the nation's No. 2 rushing defense. The Blue Devils had just 33 yards on 35 rushing attempts.\nDuke's problems on the ground were especially evident in the third quarter. Leading 9-0, the Blue Devils had a chance to build a cushion after Boston College's Sherman Alston muffed a punt that Duke's Johnell Barnes recovered at the Eagles' 15.\nTwo runs set up Duke with first and goal at the Boston College 1, but the Eagles stiffened. Duke came up short on four consecutive rushes, the last of which was a blast into the middle of the line by Jela Duncan from the 1.\nBoston College outgained Duke 305-228, getting its offense going in the second half.\nThe Eagles amassed just 100 total yards in the first half after failing to complete any of their nine passing attempts. Flutie misfired on both of his attempts before being replaced by Smith, who was 0 for 7.\nOne of those incompletions was particularly painful for the Eagles.\nOn third and 12 from the Duke 25, Smith lofted a pass toward the front left corner of the end zone. Smith leaped over Duke cornerback Alonzo Saxton II and got both of his hands on the ball. The ball popped out after the players fell to the ground, and officials ruled the pass incomplete.\nWhen instant replay upheld the ruling, Boston College coach Steve Addazio was emphatic in expressing his disagreement with the call.\nThe Eagles lined up for a field-goal try but came away with no points when holder Bobby Swigert was tackled after struggling to corral a low snap.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
