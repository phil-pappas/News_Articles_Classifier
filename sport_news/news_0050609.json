Stephen Hodge , an outside linebacker on the Fordham football team, stands 6-foot-2 and weighs less than 200 pounds with his helmet and pads on. He walked onto the Rams three years ago, willing to compete for playing time as the fifth wide receiver on the depth chart. Unable to crack that unit, Hodge hedged his bet, accepting a role on defense in order to make it onto the field. Since then, he’s developed a unique ability to leverage his way into opponents’ backfields, shedding blocks and lowering his shoulder.\n“He doesn’t look like a football player all the time,” defensive coordinator David Blackwell said. “You walk up to the guy and say, ‘That’s a linebacker?’ He looks more like a safety, or, God forbid, a kicker.”\nNow a junior and named the Patriot League defensive player of the week Monday following a 15-tackle performance in a 32-30 win over Holy Cross, Hodge and Fordham (9-0) have come full circle. Once forgotten as few fans found their way into the stands at Coffey Field for home games, Hodge and the defense have been charged with maintaining leads established by an explosive spread offense.\nIn rebuilding on the Rose Hill campus, coach Joe Moorhead has called for “bare knuckle” and “back alley” mentalities as the Rams prepare to play Bucknell Saturday afternoon.\n“We like doing that dirty work,” Hodge said. “There’s no selfishness.”\nHodge’s path to Rose Hill wound through New Jersey and Pennsylvania before landing him in the Bronx. He helped win two New Jersey state championships at Shawnee High, then starred under former Jets quarterback Glenn Foley at Valley Forge Military Academy, waking up at 4:30 a.m. most days and running Hell Hill for punishment. “If your room was out of order, they’d run you until you threw up or passed out,” Hodge said.\nAt Valley Forge, he served as a captain for a team that claimed a national prep championship. Fordham afforded him the only opportunity to play in college, but could not give him a scholarship. It was Fordham or Kutztown University near Valley Forge. He chose the Rams, and credits Blackwell with putting him in position to make plays on attacking schemes and in coverage. Blackwell considers Hodge “a dynamic blitzer,” and likes the comfort level Hodge has found this season.\n“He’s a very instinctive player, very aggressive and playing downhill in the run game,” Blackwell said.\nMoorhead counts Hodge, who has also seen snaps at safety and on the defensive line during his career, as a reliable upperclassman, and wants his men ready for battle against Bucknell. In practice Wednesday, Hodge and the defense dressed in maroon from helmet to toe, shooting gaps and “sharpening the axe,” as one coach’s shirt said. Moorhead told the players to be ready to hit, imploring them to make sure their chin straps are on and bodies prepared to exact revenge for last season’s 27-24 loss to Bucknell.\n“Last year they kind of took it to us a bit,” Hodge said. “I think this year will be a little different.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:45:28.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
