(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) \nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Anibal Godoy slid in a goal early in the second half and the San Jose Earthquakes beat Sporting Kansas City 1-0 on Friday night to move into a fifth-place tie in the Western Conference. \nSan Jose (13-12-8) is tied with Portland and Seattle with 47 points, while Sporting KC (13-10-9) is alone in fourth place with 48 points. \nIn the 47th minute, Shea Salinas sent a cross to Chris Wondolowski, who one-touched it across goal to an open Godoy at the far post. \nSan Jose is undefeated at home in its last five games and has not lost to Sporting KC at home since Aug. 16, 2000. \nDavid Bingham recorded his 12th shutout of the season to tie Vancouver’s David Ousted for second-best in the MLS. \nSporting KC’s best scoring chance came when Benny Feilhaber chipped the defense, but Mikey Lopez’s wide open header went just over the crossbar in the 71st.
