And it is getting ready to play arguably its biggest game since 2008 on Saturday against Saddle Brook.\nThere are plenty of reasons for the Owls’ impressive 3-0 start, which includes their first victory in 18 years over longtime rival Hasbrouck Heights.\nExperience. Maturity. A new, exciting, wide-open offense.\nBut the biggest reason all the little things suddenly are working in Park Ridge’s favor has to be senior quarterback Evan Matthews. He’s emerged as one of the top all-around signal callers in North Jersey, sparking one of the best program revival stories this season.\n“He’s done everything and then some,” said Park Ridge coach Tom Curry Jr.\nThe 5-foot-11, 175-pounder has always had a good arm, but he’s begun to do more on the ground this season. He’s completed 43 of 62 passes for 809 yards and five touchdowns, while rushing for 226 and four touchdowns.\nThat has the Owls averaging 26 points after averaging 20.9 in 10 games last season.\n“Ultimately, it’s his intelligence,” said new offensive coordinator Angelo DeSalvo. “The game can slow down for him because of how smart he is.”\nThis is Matthews’ third season as a starter, and he really has grown into the job.\n“I’m just a lot more comfortable,” Matthews said. “The past two years, I’d get down on myself if I threw an interception or did something wrong. Now, I just move on and focus on the next play.\n“I’m trying to be a leader. I want the kids to see me being positive and staying up.”\nMatthews also has learned how not to force the issue, looking for opportunities and taking what defenses give him. It helps that DeSalvo’s offense immediately was validated as the Owls scored on their first three drives during last month’s 26-0 opening day win over Harrison.\nWhich brings us to Saturday, one of those big games that Matthews and the Park Ridge upperclassmen have been waiting years to play. A win against the Falcons (3-0) not only would provide a nifty power point boost in North 1, Group 1, but it also would allow Park Ridge to take first place in the NJIC Meadowlands Division.\nThis will be a big challenge for Matthews on several levels. Saddle Brook has been playing solid defense, allowing only four touchdowns in three games – including last week’s shutout against Secaucus.\nAll the rain and wind preceding the possible arrival of Hurricane Joaquin will make for a sloppy field, and it will be interesting to see how Matthews adjusts.\n“I’ll be ready for that,” Matthews said. “This is only our second year with turf here, so I’m use to playing on a muddy field. You just deal with it, and go out and do what you have to do.”\nMatthews, who also plays baseball for Park Ridge, doesn’t know if he wants to play football in college. DeSalvo sent his early-season highlight film to Division III Union in upstate New York, so some sort of opportunity could materialize.\nFor now, however, Matthews is just reveling in Park Ridge’s success, hoping for an opportunity to play some December football.\n“The playoffs are our main goal,” Matthews said. “It’s just a lot more fun playing games that have meaning. I remember what it’s like being 2-8 and feeling like we’re just going through the motions.”\n“Right now, I think he’s enjoying himself,” DeSalvo said. “That’s the bottom line.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:28:02.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
