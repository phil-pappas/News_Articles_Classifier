Cycling in June, on his first day in charge, all pumped up to salvage an organization that had been muddied by Lance Armstrong and one of the biggest, ugliest doping scandals in sports history.\nAs the new president and chief executive, he swings open the front doors of the headquarters in Colorado Springs and takes an initial stroll. The décor makes him cringe.\nSome of the photos on the wall are of past champions, including Levi Leipheimer, an Armstrong teammate who admitted doping, and Bobby Julich, another Armstrong teammate who admitted doping. There’s even at least one photo of Armstrong, who in 2012 was barred from Olympic sports for life, for doping.\nBouchard-Hall knew those photos had to go.\n“Those are symbols of an appalling past and appalling behavior, and even though I can understand it and sympathize with it, those pictures don’t inspire me,” he said. “In fact, it’s the opposite.”\n Related Coverage A Drug Hits Cycling Before It Hits the Market JULY 29, 2015 Sports of The Times: Cycling May Turn Armstrong Into a Sympathetic Figure Yet JULY 17, 2015 Sports of The Times: Executive’s Ride Into Sunset Signals Brighter Day for U.S.A. Cycling DEC. 16, 2014 So, weeks later, down those pictures came. And into the hall closet they went. (You know a sport has a doping problem when that closet was already called the Hall of Shame, home to a photo collection of past dopers.)\n Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nBouchard-Hall, 45, said some of his friends and colleagues warned him that removing the photos from the walls might look as if he were trying to bury cycling’s dirty past. But from my perspective, there’s no chance of that, as Bouchard-Hall appears to be the exact opposite of his predecessor, Steve Johnson, who finally retired from U.S.A. Cycling after nearly a decade as the leader of the sport in the United States.\nJohnson didn’t like to talk about doping. Blinders on, he pushed forward past the scandals year after year, never speaking out — as a good leader should have — against the drug use that was corroding his sport, damaging his organization and embarrassing clean athletes who were often lumped in with the dopers.\nFor a sport trying to win back the public, it should be a relief that Johnson is gone. Good riddance: His final official duty for U.S.A. Cycling was working at last month’s World Road Cycling Championships here.\nAdvertisement\n It was there I met Bouchard-Hall. Tall and wispy and dressed in a spiffy suit, he looked so businesslike that he could have just walked off Wall Street and into the hotel lobby where we spoke for nearly two hours.\n Related in Opinion Opinion: How to Fight Doping in Sports AUG. 1, 2015 Bouchard-Hall gave up a top job at the British sports retailer Wiggle, taking a sizable pay cut, so he could help U.S.A. Cycling turn around and win back sponsors. That includes changing the public perception of cycling in the United States, which, because of Armstrong and his teammates, took a nose dive to the pavement and has yet to climb back onto its feet.\nBouchard-Hall is passionate about his mission, so much so that he left his wife and two daughters in London, where he had been working and where they will stay until the girls finish this school year.\nI asked him, Why do this to yourself? Why leave a lucrative position at Wiggle to take over a sport constantly dinged by doping cases, including a recent one involving Tom Danielson, a top American rider who testified in the Armstrong doping investigation? In August, before the Tour of Utah, Danielson’s initial urine sample tested positive for a steroid .\nAdvertisement\n Bouchard-Hall answered, “I love the sport that much.”\nHe added that he couldn’t bear to watch cycling flounder, post-Armstrong.\nSports of The Times A collection of columns offering opinion and analysis from the world of sports.
