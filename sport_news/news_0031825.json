Even though we had some bumps in the road today with injuries and things, we pulled together as a team to win.”\nO’Hayer was referring to Saints’ libero Avery Grimm, who injured her thumb early in the fourth set and missed the rest of the match. She was headed to the hospital for X-rays after the match.\nThe fourth set started with a personal milestone for SVA’s junior outside hitter Sarah Stewart, who notched her 1,000th career kill off a set from Sydney Sanders. But after Grimm went down, the Knights took control of the set and cruised to a 25-17 win to force a deciding fifth set to 15.\nPace Academy looked good early in the fifth set, but the Saints stayed close behind the hitting of Stewart, who had 21 kills, 14 digs and four aces on the day.\nThe Knights led 9-6, when the Saints got a break when a Pace Academy player touched a ball that was clearly out. Stewart followed with a big kill. Trailing 11-10, SVA got some great defense on a tip by Pace Academy star Summer Brown to keep a rally alive, with Stewart putting another kill away for the point.\nPace Academy had match point leading 14-13, when Sanders back set Stewart beautifully for a vicious cross-court kill that tied it at 14-14. Pace had another match point leading 15-14, but missed long with an attack. SVA middle blocker Grace Friday then made a key kill at the net, setting up the game-winning ace by O’Hayer.\n“I was shaking at the end of the match,” Stewart said. “I was nearly crying, we wanted to win it so bad. We showed we had the power to come from behind to win against a team that was well rounded with their hitting and passing.”\nThe Saints (29-13) had their hands full trying to slow down Brown, a 6-foot-4 junior outside hitter/middle blocker who has committed to Duke. Brown was a force at the net with 17 kills and a 65 percent kill percentage. But the Saints stuck to their game plan. Sanders had 34 assists, 10 kills and 12 digs, while Friday added 10 kills. Grimm had seven digs, three assists and three aces. Hannah Routon, who stepped in at libero when Grimm went down, added nine digs.\n“We’ve worked with our hitters all season on seeing the block, and finding what works,” SVA coach Jennifer Fleming said. “We did a good job at finding our angles.”\nPace Academy setter Meghan Botsch played well with 25 assists and four kills, as the Knights were focused on beating an SVA team that took them down in five sets in a thrilling quarterfinal last season.\n“It was the same situation as last year,” Brown said. “We had a lot of energy this time and we wanted to win, but in the key moments — they were able to pull it off.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837917.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837917.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:19:15.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
