Bulldogs claim 3rd straight tennis sectional title By Rick Teverbaugh The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin \nANDERSON — Having now amassed two straight Madison County titles and three straight sectional crowns, the Lapel boys tennis team is clearly the dominant area team of its sport. \nThe Bulldogs defeated Frankton 5-0 at Highland Middle School on Friday for that third straight sectional title, the first time that feat has been accomplished by any team in school history. \n“Our four seniors have been the core of that team’s run,” said Lapel coach Justin Coomer. “People don’t realize how much time and work went in to getting to this level. It is a really big deal to us to put this run together.” \nSenior Garrett Fensler and sophomore Joseph Conrad got things going Lapel’s way early with a pair of 6-0, 6-0 victories at No.1 and No. 2 singles respectively. Fensler got past Keegan Freestone and Conrad topped Wesley Garrison. \nThe most competitive match was at No. 1 doubles where Lapel senior tandem Daniel Conrad and Daulton Fensler defeated the Eagles pairing of Landon Weins and Mitchell Wiley 6-3, 6-1. \n“The wind made it a little hard to put shots away,” said Fensler of the doubles match. “Our idea against them was to go cross court. In the second set we played a lot smarter. We went down the lines when they would poach.” \nAt No. 3 singles, Sophomore Austin Lyons defeated Ethan Blake 6-2, 6-1. In the No. 2 doubles match, Samuel Parkison, a senior, and Zach Krebs teamed to top Dayton Stanley and Trent McFerran 6-0, 6-1. \n“Brett (Frankton coach Sanders) has always got a scrappy team and they play hard,” said Coomer. \nNext up for Lapel will be a Tuesday trip to Marion High School for regional competition. The Bulldogs will play the host Giants at 4:30 p.m. \n“The past two years, Marion knocked us out of the regional and we drew them again,” said Coomer. “We just played them last Monday and beat them 5-0. But some of those matches were pretty close. We will need to be ready and play well.” Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:39:07.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
