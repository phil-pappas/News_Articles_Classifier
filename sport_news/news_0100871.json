A 2–0 loss to Honduras on Saturday means the Catrachos will represent CONCACAF at Rio 2016, and the U.S. will have to win the tournament’s third-place game and a playoff against Colombia to join them.\nHonduras opened the scoring through Alberth Elis in the 24th minute, as he pulled down a cross from Kevin Álvarez on the right wing and calmly hit his shot inside the far post. The U.S. struggled to cope with Honduras’s organized defense, leaving goalkeeper Luis López relatively untroubled throughout the first half.\nLópez came up huge the one time he needed to, though.
