They're no juggernaut yet but it's a start.\nQuote: OF THE NIGHT\n“I was glad for the guys. You could just see air out of a big balloon going out. And it was the same for the people in the stands. That’s why I think they cheered for so long after that goal. They wanted to see a goal as bad as we did.”\n- Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau on Cam Fowler’s goal.\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT\n- Eight players recorded their first points of the season, including Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry and newcomer Carl Hagelin.\nPLAYER OF THE GAME\n- Rickard Rakell was going from his first shift and Boudreau realized it in continuing to throw the 22-year-old center on the ice. Rakell had three shots on goal and was doing what he could to get linemates Jiri Sekac and Chris Stewart going. His willingness to be at the net was rewarded when he tipped in Hampus Lindholm’s shot from the point in the first period. The only thing the Swede struggled at was faceoffs, where he lost 10 of 15 draws.\nANALYSIS\n- Some head scratching was in order when Bruce Boudreau opted to go with Anton Khudobin in goal instead of Frederik Andersen with his team desperately needing a win before it headed out on the road for five tough games. Boudreau’s call paid off as Khudobin delivered 34 saves in an effort that saw the veteran getting better and looking more confident as the game went on. It was risky but Boudreau also knows he needs Khudobin to play well and not lose the 29-year-old from a mental standpoint, especially in the first third of the season so that they don’t burn Andersen out early. The Ducks are getting there with their overall game but they still look disjointed at times offensively and aren’t coming at teams in waves, which is their hallmark under Boudreau. Maybe that should be expected for a team that’s still working in a number of new pieces.\nKEY MOMENT\n- A team in dire need of confidence got a heavy dose of it with one shot. Relief and joy were eminently visible among the Ducks and the restless fans at Honda Center when Fowler’s fling off a pass back from Getzlaf snaked its way through traffic and got by Minnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk, ending a 173-minute, 12-second scoreless streak.\nANY NEWS?\n- Ducks center Chris Wagner cleared waivers Sunday and remained with the team. The move to put him on waivers gives them the option to send him down to the AHL within their next 10 games or 30 days without him requiring the process again. Also, one side of the new $10-million scoreboard at Honda Center was out the entire game due to a technical issue that is fixable.\nMORE POSTGAME Quote: S\nCAM FOWLER\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-anaheimducks.logo.jpg.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-anaheimducks.logo.jpg.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:20:34.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
