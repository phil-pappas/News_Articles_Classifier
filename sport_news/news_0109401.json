The 22-year-old was also named Player of the Year after becoming the youngest golfer to claim the FedEx Cup and its US$10 million bonus. \nSpieth will be skipping the Farmers Insurance Open on the PGA Tour in favour of the Singapore Open, which features a prize purse of at least US$1 million. \nThe 50th Singapore Open will be played at Sentosa Golf Club's Serapong Course from Jan 28 to 31. - CNA/ek", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:23:38.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
