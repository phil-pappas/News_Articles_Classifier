Mod title, Brunnhoelzl wins Charlotte Pit road tangle ruins Charlotte race for Busch, Larson \nJoey Logano made a statement in Sunday's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Charlotte Motor Speedway - he and Team Penske will be major players in the Chase for the Sprint Cup. \nLogano dominated the race, which had been pushed back from Saturday night due to rain, leading 227 of the 334 laps, the most in his career. It marked his 12th career victory, and punched his ticket to the Eliminator round of the Chase, meaning he won't have to worry about the unpredictability of the cutoff race at Talladega in a couple of weeks. \nLogano spoke to the media afterwards, talking about the win and the Chase implications. We also heard from car owner Roger Penske, along with second place finisher Kevin Harvick and third place finisher Martin Truex, Jr. \nAustin Dillon made a bold move for the lead of Friday night's NASCAR Xfinity Series race with a three wide move on Erik Jones and Kyle Busch with 54 laps to go, and went on to score the victory at Charlotte Motor Speedway. \nDillon beat out Jones by 2.8 seconds for the win. While Dillon moved away for the victory, the two strongest cars all night, Kyle Busch and Kasey Kahne, tangled after pushing each other around, with both cars slamming the wall, spoiling their nights. \nBut up front, it was all Austin Dillon, as he scored his sixth series victory. Dillon talked to the media about the win afterwards. We also heard from fourth place finisher Daniel Suarez. \nBoth the NASCAR Sprint Cup and Xfinity Series will be in action this weekend at Kansas Speedway. WDUN will have live coverage of Saturday's Xfinity Series race at 3:30 pm on 102.9 FM, while Sunday's Sprint Cup Series race can be heard at 1 pm on both 102.9 FM and 550 AM. \nTo keep up with the latest motorsports news anytime, visit our Around The Track page.
