A replay using goal line technology showed the ball had failed to fully cross the line by the slimmest of margins. \nPlaymaker Cesc Fabregas had a goal marginally ruled offside as Chelsea pressed hard for a first half equalizer. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:20:24.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
