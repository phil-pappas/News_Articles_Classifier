Only this time he got plenty of help from his backfield mates and his quarterback as the No. 5/7 Tigers improved to 5-0 and 3-0 in SEC play.\nFournette carried 20 times -- his second fewest in five games -- for 158 yards, his lowest yardage total of the season. But that was a good thing since he didn't feel the weight of the entire offense on his back for a change. The yardage total was his lowest this season. But LSU rushed for 396 yards and averaged 7.3 yards per carry.\n\"It's knowing I'm not the only one on the team,\" Fournette said when asked about other offensive players. \"It's not just the rushing but the passing, too. We got everybody involved. Travin, the tight ends, Tyron Johnson. They're stepping up and that's what we need.\"\nLeonard Fournette on RB teammate Derrius Guice: 'He's a man' | Video LSU running back Leonard Fournette talks to the media after Saturday's victory against South Carolina.\nFreshman backfield mate Derrius Guice outrushed Fournette with 161 yards on 16 carries, including his first career TD on a 4-yard run in the fourth quarter. Darrel Williams rushed for 61 yards and two touchdowns on 10 tries. Those three touchdowns were the first by an LSU running back other than Fournette this season.\nThe passing game finally busted out with it's best overall performance. Quarterback Brandon Harris completed 18 of 28 for 228 yards and two touchdowns, season highs on all four. He threw 23 passes in the first half as LSU tried to make the Gamecocks pay for stacking the line. Fournette had only 49 yards on 15 carries in the first half.\nHarris threw a 10-yard scoring pass to Malachi Dupre on a fade route in the second quarter and came back to hit Travin Dural with a 62-yard score in the third. The latter play came when Harris threw high for tight end DeSean Smith, who tipped the ball to Dural. he caught the ball without breaking stride and scored easily.\n\"The guy drilled me in the face when I was throwing that ball,\" Harris said of the South Carolina pass rush. \"Leonard was showing me the video. . . so I couldn't put anything on the ball. It was a hell of a play, a heads up play by him (Dural.)\"\nBut Harris' best performance resulted in a field goal when he moved the team into position just before the half. South Carolina had gotten back into the game at 14-10 on a 96-yard kickoff return.\nA John battle interception killed South Carolina drive and LSU had the ball at its 34 with 1:19 left. Harris took a checkdown pass to FOurnette on the first play and two plays later hit Malachi Dupre for 28. A key 8-yard completion to Tyron Johnson on third-and-7 pushed the Tigers closer.\nPass wasn't intended for him, but LSU's Travin Dural made the big play | Video He hauled in a 62-yard TD pass on a deflected pass\nHarris spiked the ball to kill the clock and then threw two passes away rather than try to force them into coverage in the end zone. It allowed LSU to go into halftime leading 17-10. Three plays after halftime Fournette did his thing with an 87 yard spring down the middle of the field.\n\"Those are important points at the end of the half,\" Harris said. \"We've done a good job of when a team comes down and scores, we answer back . Momentum is important and they had gotten the momentum right then.\n\"We haven't been behind in any games. There's no need to drop back and throw the ball 40 times a game when we have four animals in the backfield that can run the ball.\"\nThe backup animals took over. Fournette ran the ball only five times int he second half and didn't return after leaving midway in the third quarter.\nGuice, who has shown flashes of his ability, had his breakout game. He kept a TD drive alive with a daring 17-yard run on second-and-18. On LSU's next drive, he carried 13, 1 and 25 yards on the first three plays while Darrel Williams chipped in with a 27-yard run. One play later, Williams crashed over fromt he 1-yard line.\nGuice wasn't finished. He added runs of 20 and 39 yards as LSU ground out the clock and ground down the Gamecock defense.\n\"He's a man; he's wild,\" Fournette said of Guice, the freshman from Baton Rouge. \"He never likes going down, a beast.\"\nSaid Miles:\"He's pretty talented. Reckless might be the best (word). Angry. There are a number of ways to describe his running style. Efficient.\"\nEfficient isn;t quite the word for the LSU passing game. It still has some issues and the 62-yard TD came with a bit of luck. But the wide receivers appear to have overcome their drop problems that led to seven in the last two games.\nLSU offense comes together in 45-24 rout of South Carolina | Vlog LSU beat writer Jim Kleinpeter and columnist Ron Higgins break down the Tigers' victory on Saturday.\nMiles talked about shuffling the lineup and although Trey Quinn and John Diarse started the game, Dural and Dupre played most of the snaps. They combined for 10 catches for 183 yards and two scores.\n\"They worked so hard this week, every one of those guys,\" Harris said. \"We were out there 30 or 40 minutes after practice just working routes.\"\nSaid Miles: \"Last week was an unusual piece. We're really going to be a team that can count on being productive in the throwing game and count on those guys to make catches.\n\"It's what we're going to do. It's who we are. We had the opportunity to be pressed some. We will throw the football.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:58:54.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
