On Sept. 22, the student told a teacher “I have plan for everyone at the school.” On Oct. 5, a bus driver overheard the student tell another student, “You will die. I’m going to kill you,” according to a report from the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office. The threats were reported by the school. The student is a pre-teen who with a history of behavioral issues and does not necessarily have a clear way of acting out his anger, said Deputy Rob Lyons. Lyons said the school most likely reported the threats because of a heightened sensitivity following a mass shooting plot at Summerville High School uncovered last week. Investigators have taken the threats under evaluation to determine whether the incident is a criminal matter.
