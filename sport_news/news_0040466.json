Taylor got his yards — 201 in fact — to keep his offense on the field for a large portion of the contest. \nBut when it came down to it, the Jays’ defense proved up for the task. \nJefferson City (8-1) forced five turnovers in its first win against Rockhurst (4-5) since 2011. Defensive backs Dennis Barnes and Gavin Strobel each picked off Rockhurst passes. The Hawklets fumbled six times, losing three of them. \nThe first quarter got off to a slow start. Rockhurst deferred to the second half and the Jays went three-and-out on their first possession. \nRockhurst lit the scoreboard first with a Jackson Terry 22-yard field goal. \nThe Jays countered with a 10-play drive, capped off with a Denzel Wilson 2-yard rushing touchdown. \nTerry connected from 31 yards out to put the Hawklets within one late in the first quarter. \nBarnes raced the ensuing kickoff back for a touchdown, starting an onslaught of four-straight scores. They Jays head a commanding 35-6 halftime lead. \nFollowing the Barnes return, Taylor fumbled away the ball right back to the Jays. Four plays later, Joseph Bustamante punched in a 2-yard score. \nOn the Hawklets’ next possession, defensive lineman Mekhi Burnley recovered a fumble that was stripped by linebacker Jalen Martin. Two plays later, Jays quarterback Gunnar See flushed to his left and found Ellinger streaking down the sideline, connecting for a 28-yard touchdown. \nRockhurst faltered after driving, giving the ball right back to See, who connected with Huff for an 68-yard score with 2:14 left before half. \nTo open the second half, Rockhurst quarterback Chance May threw a 16-yard touchdown to Chris Teahan on the opening possession. \nThe Jays wasted no time extending its advantage with another See to Ellinger score — this one was a See pump fake to Huff and 42-yard fade to Ellinger. \nTaylor dashed for his lone touchdown of the game from 36 yards out with 6:06 left in the third. Then Huff showcased his speed with an 83-yard return for a touchdown. \nThe Jays scored off a Rockhurst turnover for the third time when Wilson ran for his second touchdown of the game to wrap up the scoring at 55-20. \nThe Jays had lost 16 of their last 17 meetings to Rockhurst. \nJefferson City hosts Rock Bridge at 7 p.m. Friday at Adkins Stadium. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:16:00.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
