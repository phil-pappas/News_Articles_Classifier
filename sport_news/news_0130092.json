The team’s bye – early as it may be in a season in which the team has jumped out to a 3-0 start – affords the Patriots that luxury. “There’s things that have come up along the way that we need to clean up, go back, talk about it a little bit, do a better job of coaching, do a better job of executing them on the field, understanding the situations and in a way taking care of some problems behind us but also trying to move forward into things that we think will benefit us in the future,” said Belichick. “So that’s kind of where we’re at today.” Hooman reportedly dealt: The NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday night that the Patriots have traded tight end Michael Hoomanawanui to the New Orleans Saints in exchange for defensive lineman Akiem Hicks. Watson, Thompkins cut: The team released four players, linebacker Dekoda Watson from the active roster and a trio, including wide receiver Kenbrell Thompkins, from the practice squad. Watson played the last two games and was credited with one tackle on special teams. Along with Thompkins, guard Chris Barker and defensive tackle Joe Vellano, were released from the practice squad. An inside job: The Patriots remained indoors Wednesday, practicing inside the Empower Field House, a decision that was influenced by the upcoming schedule more than the day’s inclement weather. Belichick said the move was made “so we can work on our timing and our execution a little bit. “We’ve got a couple games coming up inside,” he pointed out. When the Patriots get back to work following this week’s bye, they’ll face trips to Dallas and Indianapolis to play at stadiums with retractable roofs. Kiss it goodbye: Quarterback Tom Brady on the team’s upcoming bye: “Before you know it, we’ll be back here Monday, be back to work.” No comparison: Care to compare Patriots teams present and past? The coach doesn’t. “We don’t compare ourselves to anybody,” Belichick answered when asked how he felt about people comparing this team to the 2007 squad that went 16-0. “We just try to go out there and improve, do a good job (and) get ready for Dallas next week.” Page 2 of 2 - Four downs of depth: Belichick said he believes that Jon Bostic, the linebacker the Patriots acquired from Chicago earlier in the week in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in 2016, could provide the team with depth on all four downs. “Jonathan’s been a productive player,” Belichick said. “He’s been productive in college (at Florida). (He) started a bunch a game for the Bears, has played both inside and outside in a 4-3, (is) athletic, runs well, (and is) smart. He can play in the kicking game, so I think he can potentially give us depth on all four downs.” A second-round pick in 2013, Bostic appeared in 29 games with the Bears over his first two years with the team, starting 17, and led the team in tackles with 127 in 2014. With a new regime (John Fox succeeding Marc Trestman as head coach) in place, a shift from a 4-3 to a 3-4 defensive scheme and slowed by an ankle injury, Bostic was listed as inactive for the Bears’ first three games of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:21:45.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
