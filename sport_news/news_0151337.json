The cleaning staff had done a good job of restoring the room, but for the heartiest partiers, cleaning out the personal cobwebs would take more time. \nSuch are the wages of the Blue Jays’ first celebration of a division championship in 22 years. But as manager John Gibbons observed, “it had been so damned long,” so they partied as if making up for lost time. \nThey also had a game to play. Or something resembling a game, like the one they played using a Triple-A lineup in the nightcap of Wednesday’s doubleheader. The regulars had routed the Orioles 15-2 in the opener, thereby clinching the American League East title. Gibbons rested his starters for Game 2, which Baltimore won 8-1, and then everybody went back inside and donned their goggles and Go-Pro cameras and got wet. \nOn Thursday, Camden Yards also got very wet. Officials had switched the game time from 7:05 p.m. to 12:05 to take advantage of an alleged rainless period, but midway through the the first inning, the forecast proved egregiously flawed. \nDrew Hutchison barely survived the first inning. By the time the rain delay began, he had surrendered four hits (all for extra bases), walked one batter and hit another. The Orioles led the Blue Jays/Buffalo Bisons 3-0 when the rain delay was imposed. Nothing like the post clinch rain delay….ugh! pic.twitter.com/fC0ne8bekr \n— R.A. Dickey (@RADickey43) October 1, 2015 \n*** \nHutchison was starting for the B team because the Jays decided to shut down their ace, David Price, for the rest of the regular season and keep him fresh to start Game 1 of the American League Division Series. That starts in Toronto next Thursday against an opponent and at a time to be determined. Instead of starting him in Tampa Bay this weekend, management wants to save its ace for more serious business. \nSome serious business does remain in the regular season, however. The Jays are one game ahead of Kansas City for the best overall record in the AL, which would give them home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. So Gibbons plans to start his regulars for the final regular-season series in Tampa. \nIt a measure of how far and how fast the Jays have come that on July 31, they were nine games back of the Royals. By Aug. 31, the deficit was 6.5 games. On Monday, Toronto slipped ahead by a game. \nThe Jays also hope shortstop Troy Tulowitzki is ready to play in a game or two before the season ends. He is recovering apace from a cracked shoulder blade suffered Sept. 12 and is scheduled to hit in a simulated game in Tampa on Friday. If that goes well, he may be in the lineup for Saturday’s game. \nMark Buehrle, who needs 8.2 innings to reach 200 for the 15 th straight year, is set to start Friday and may start again Sunday if he’s a couple of innings short, Gibbons said. \n*** \nMeanwhile, the Jays-O’s game resumed after a delay of three hours and 29 minutes. The official attendance was announced at 18,257, but the place was almost deserted. By the middle innings, fans clustered in the first few rows at field level were yelling directions to the two or three souls in the upper deck who were trying to find foul balls. And when one was found, and the finder raised his hand in triumph, his field-level assistants would raise a rousing cheer. \nOtherwise, the place was so quiet that Munenori Kawasaki’s dugout cheerleading was audible in the press box.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:32:50.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
