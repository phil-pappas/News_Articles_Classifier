(Photo: PTI) New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday tweeted a \"get well soon\" message for ailing BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu, a gesture which was used by NC leader Omar Abdullah to question him whether the \"cold blooded\" Dadri lynching incident does not merit his \"attention\".\n\"Dear @sherryontopp ji, get well soon. You are a fighter & will overcome the illness in your trademark style. Our prayers are with you,\" Modi said in a message to Sidhu, a party colleague and former cricketer. Sidhu is hospitalised here for a clot in his vein.\nDear @sherryontopp ji, get well soon. You are a fighter & will overcome the illness in your trademark style. Our prayers are with you.\n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 7, 2015 Sidhu responded by tweeting, \"@narendramodi Sir, your concern means the world to me. You are a Great example & inspiration to serve my Country selflessly. Jai Hind!\"\nHowever, the Prime Minister's message on Sidhu's illness was used by Omar, a National Conference(NC) leader, to take a swipe at Modi.\n\"What does it say about our Hon PM that Sidhu's DVT (blood clot) got more attention from him that #Ikhlaq's cold blooded murder did!!!!,\" tweeted the former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister.\nWhat does it say about our Hon PM that Sidhu's DVT (blood clot) got more attention from him that #Ikhlaq 's cold blooded murder did!!!!\n— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) October 7, 2015 Ikhlaq was lynched and his son injured critically by a mob in his house in Dadri in Uttar Pradesh on September 28 following rumours that they had consumed beef.\nThe lynching has sparked a massive outrage but the Prime Minister has not spoken publicly yet on the deadly attack.\nTags: Narendra Modi Dadri killing Navjot Sindhu Omar Abdullah Also Read Intensive follow up meetings scheduled post Modi-Obama summit BJP, Modi misleading people on J&K married women's residency: Omar Abdullah BJP takes campaign closer to people BJP, Congress spar over Narendra Modi's 'scam India to skill India' remark", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/abdullah_omar/status/651650939925848064", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://twitter.com/sherryontopp", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Omar_1_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ikhlaq?src=hash", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151007/nation-current-affairs/article/pm-says-get-well-navjot-sidhu-omar-abdullah-asks-why-no", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Omar_1_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/651633045506621440", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T14:33:04.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
