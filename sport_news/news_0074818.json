The Union, who play at PPL Park in Chester, are completing their sixth MLS season.\nA former professional goalkeeper, Sakiewicz founded Keystone Sports & Entertainment in 2006 and assembled the investors who eventually became the ownership group of the Union. \nThe Union are 9-15-7 this year and will be eliminated from the postseason with a tie or loss Saturday at Toronto. They have just three MLS games left. The team has qualified for the postseason just once, during its second season in 2011. \nFor the second straight year, the Union advanced to the final in the U.S. Open Cup. They lost, 7-6, in penalty kicks Wednesday to visiting Sporting Kansas City after the teams played to 1-1 draw through 120 minutes. \nLast year, the Union fell to the Seattle Sounders, 3-1, in extra time in the U.S. Open final, also at PPL Park. \nSakiewicz has been the target of mounting social media criticism for the Union's struggles. He was not available for comment on Thursday. \nThe Union have been the subject of other recent personnel rumors. The team denied a report earlier in the week by Empireofsoccer.com that said the Union would hire former MLS coach Octavio Zambrano as its technical director.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:43:53.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
