Photo: Getty Images\nLOS ANGELES: The New York Mets have advanced to Major League Baseball's National League Championship Series by winning 3-2 at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the decisive game on Thursday, with Daniel Murphy responsible for the tying and go-ahead runs.\nThe Mets will play the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS.\nNew York trailed 2-1 when the Dodgers somehow failed to have anyone on third base during a play, and Murphy stole it, and then scored on a sacrifice fly. Murphy then hit a solo homer in the sixth to put the Mets ahead.\nClosing pitcher Jeurys Familia made the first six-out save of his career as he worked the eighth and ninth in quick time.\nAdvertisement The big-spending Dodgers remain without a World Series title since 1988.\nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:43:07.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
