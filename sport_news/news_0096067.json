Related Content \nTwo - perhaps skill is involved. \nBut three in a row is the stuff dynasty's are made of. \nLewis Palmer’s volleyball team has a shot at the three-peat this year, thanks in part to a junior captain with quite the legacy. \n“There's been such a storied tradition of success in our program,” said head coach Susan Odenbaugh. “These girls come in want to maintain that legacy and work hard.” \nFor Lydia Bartalo, maintaining that legacy is as easy as signing her name. \nHer sisters Hannah and Abby helped lead the Rangers to their four total state championship titles. \nNow Lydia is picking up the torch. \n“[They were] able to ease me into it and just teach me the ropes of high school,” says Lydia Bartalo. “[They taught me] what Lewis Palmer volleyball really is.” \nLegacy is sort of a buzz word in the sports community, but as Lewis Palmer seeks their third title in just three years, the Bartalo family seemingly knows how to bring home the hardware. \nIn hopes of maintaining their winning ways, Coach Odenbaugh established this motto: \n\"Success comes from unity, and trust, and passion,” she said. \nIn Odenbaugh's 14 years as head coach - they've had plenty of success, which she credits to stressing the \"team\" mentality. \n“It's not just one person being the main person and everyone has their own specific role,” said Bartalo. “We all just have to play together or else we're not successful\" \nThe top ranked Rangers continued their quest for a third championship on Thursday against Cheyenne Mountain. \nCopyright 2015 KRDO .
