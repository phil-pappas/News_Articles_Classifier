His problems greatly exceed any win-loss record, even one as unexpectedly underwhelming as the Trojansâ current 3-2 mark.\nSarkisian is in the middle of a divorce, according to multiple reports, a development with which he apparently is struggling to cope.\nHe was said to be seeking treatment for an undisclosed issue in the aftermath of his âSalute to Troyâ embarrassment, which he later blamed on a mixture of alcohol and prescription medication.\nIn August, Sarkisian promised he wouldnât drink anymore this season, a promise that, again according to multiple reports, he broke over the weekend.\nThere is no question how much Sarkisian values his job at USC, the school he repeatedly has called âhome,â a job he more than once has labeled an âhonorâ and âprivilege.â\nOn the day he was introduced as the Trojansâ coach in December of 2013, he reminisced about watching USC games in his college dorm room and marveled at the remarkable fortune that now had him living a dream.\nStill, he was unable to prevent from happening what just happened. Thatâs how deep Sarkisianâs problems extend, these sorts of demons well known for their tireless commitment and unwillingness to die.\nNearly seven weeks ago, when he first publicly addressed the âSalute to Troyâ incident, Sarkisian refused to admit he had a problem. Hereâs hoping he is willing to admit his problem today.\nHe is in a very private fight, one that never should be played out in a place as public as the sidelines of a giant stadium. In that regard, Sarkisianâs situation didnât have to reach the awkward point that it did Sunday.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:24:37.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
