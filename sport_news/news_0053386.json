You're going to need sustained scoring all year, you can't rely on one line,” said Jets winger Blake Wheeler, who was skating with Bryan Little and captain Andrew Ladd and scored a goal against his former team. “We've played that game before and it doesn't get us very far. (Balance) is what you need to be a good team.”\nThe Jets continue this four-game road trip on Friday night against the New Jersey Devils at the Prudential Center after winning for the first time in Boston since Mar. 31 of 2007 and snapping a string of 13 consecutive defeats.\nThe Bruins came out flying, but Pavelec would only give up a goal to David Krejci at 5:36 of the first period to keep his team within striking distance.\n“We got the win, that’s all that matters at this point in the season,” said Pavelec, who made 29 saves. “Everybody was excited and we didn’t know what to expect from the first game. I just tried to stayed focused. I know how those games go... it’s the first game of the season.”\nJets defenceman Dustin Byfuglien made an excellent read to create a turnover in the neutral zone and found Mark Scheifele, who fired a laser-beam wrister past Tuukka Rask at 5:26 of the second period.\n“It just kind of makes you breathe a little bit,” said Wheeler. “As bad as the game had gone, we were tied 1-1. That's what (Byfuglien) does. He can kind of flip a game upside down with one play. That was a big moment to kind of get us some confidence and some momentum.\n“Looking back to last year, (Pavelec) has done that a number of times. He gave us a chance to win. We weathered the storm. We knew we didn't have our best in the first, it was about getting back to our game. We were able to create a couple of big turnovers and capitalize.”\nAlthough they were used sparingly in the first period, combining for just over six minutes between the three of them, the Jets' fourth line of Chris Thorburn and rookies Andrew Copp and Nic Petan delivered two goals – including the first of Petan's career in his NHL debut.\n“The main thing is playing the right way and all four lines did that, especially after the first period,” said Thorburn, whose breakaway goal restored the two-goal cushion at 5:17 of the third period. “To take some minutes off of the top lines is important, especially later in the season. We know that it starts with defence. Once coach trusts us defensively, he'll put us out there more, which will lead to more offence. That's our mindset now. We were fortunate to get two there, but that doesn't mean we're all offence now. We go back to Square 1, play well defensively and gain the coach's trust and go from there.”\nDrew Stafford and Alex Burmistrov each had a goal and an assist to pace the offensive attack.\nLadd, who pick-pocketed Bruins defenceman Matt Irwin and found Wheeler for the go-ahead goal during the second period, was happy with the final 40 minutes but quick to point out that his club was far from perfect in this one.\n“Similar to our last opening night and we lost four straight after that one,” said Ladd, referencing the 6-2 win over the Arizona Coyotes that the Jets failed to build on. “We've got to keep our heads level here. We didn't play a great game. We got better (after the first period), but there's a ton of room for improvement and hopefully we can do that (Friday) night.”\nKen.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter.com/WiebeSunSports\nWINNIPEG JETS\nBalanced scoring leads Winnipeg Jets to season-opening blowout over Bruins\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Thursday, October 08, 2015 09:39 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 08, 2015 11:59 PM EDT\nBOSTON – The Winnipeg Jets showed up late to the party, but it didn't prevent them from celebrating on opening night.\nFollowing an extremely slow start, the Jets erupted for three goals in the second period and pulled away in the third after the Boston Bruins made it interesting, skating to a 6-2 triumph at TD Garden on Thursday night.\nDrew Stafford led the way offensively, chipping in a goal and an assist as the Jets got at least a goal from each of their four lines.\nThe Jets continue a four-game road trip on Friday night against the New Jersey Devils.\nIt was a slow opening period for the Jets, who were lucky to be down only 1-0 after getting thoroughly outplayed by the Bruins.\nDavid Krejcis scored at 5:36 of the opening period after Jets defencemen Ben Chiarot and Dustin Byfuglien encountered some trouble handling the puck behind the net.\nDavid Patstrnak eventually found Krejci in front, but that was the only goal the Bruins could m\nAlso in this article Jets vs. Bruins About the author Ken Wiebe Ken Wiebe's Blog Follow Ken Wiebe on Twitter Other Stories Burmistrov has interesting return to NHL\nNEWARK, N.J. — Alex Burmistrov was all over the place as he made his return to the NHL after a two-year absence.\n0\nWinnipeg Jets rookies Nic Petan and Nikolaj Ehlers earned their spots on opening day roster\nTo say that Nic Petan never had a doubt he was going to make the Winnipeg Jets this fall would be stretching the truth.\n0\nSee more from Ken Wiebe »\n Hockey 0\nFantasy Fare: Three days of surprises 0\nEdmonton Oilers' Connor McDavid skill-set yet to include faceoffs\nWinnipeg Jets win second straight game to start NHL season 0\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/@WiebeSunSports", "http://blogs.canoe.ca/thebrawl/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-09T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:35:03.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
