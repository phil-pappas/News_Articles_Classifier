F.E. Castleberry If you venture to the banks of the River Charles this weekend to watch all of the beautiful people rowing during the Head of the Charles Regatta , you may notice a number of people wearing fancy blazers. Many of these jackets will look nice and polished, but some of them will be tattered, and some of the people wearing them will look like they could go up a size or two. What’s the deal?\nThe blazers comes from the U.K.’s Royal Henley Regatta. It’s one of the races that every rower wants to compete in before his or her career is over. At Henley, the dress code is super formal—men have to wear blazers, and women’s dresses must be below the knee (old Victorian habits die hard, it seems).\nRelated Links An insider’s guide to Head of the Charles, the essential autumn-in-New-England event At Head of the Charles, boats worth $50,000 try not to crash Given the required fanciness, when college and club teams qualify for Henley they have blazers made to wear at the event. Harvard, for example, sports crimson jackets at the regatta, as modeled by the Winklevoss twins, pictured above, made famous by Facebook. If you Google “ Henley Regatta dress code ,” you’ll get a good idea of what we’re working with here.\nPeople who’ve gone to Henley wear these blazers not just when they’re across the pond, but when they’re at other crew races and events as well, which is why you’ll see some this weekend.\nBut there’s a catch: As a rower, you only ever get one blazer per team or club you belong to. And you wear it to everything. So you can imagine that after several trips around the racing circuit (and ensuing parties), these articles of clothing get a little beat up. And considering what great shape these rowers have to be in when they first qualify for Henley, these blazers often don’t continue to fit as well as they once did as the years go on.\nSo if you see an older man walking around in a tattered jacket that he’s squeezed himself into this weekend, say congrats. He was once at the top of his game.\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Sports Why do so many people wear funny-looking blazers at Head of the Charles? 10.16.15 | 6:01 AM Patriots Patriots fans are not overconfident about beating Colts—but they have a right to be 10.15.15 | 8:27 PM Music RadioBDC Sports: Pats Prepare to Crush Colts 10.15.15 | 3:11 PM Red Sox Manny Ramirez is the Cubs’ not-so-secret weapon 10.15.15 | 2:14 PM Patriots The first rule of Deflategate: Don’t talk about Deflategate 10.15.15 | 1:50 PM Patriots Tom Brady on Deflategate, Gisele and Donald Trump 10.15.15 | 1:39 PM Red Sox Red Sox fans shouldn’t lament letting Anthony Rizzo get away 10.15.15 | 1:14 PM Patriots All 13 times Tom Brady has beaten the Colts 10.15.15 | 12:34 PM Patriots Colts too embarrassed about blowout loss to dwell on Deflategate 10.15.15 | 12:24 PM Baseball Watch Jonny Gomes take out a kid while celebrating the Royals’ ALCS berth 10.15.15 | 12:00 PM Patriots The more fans know about Deflategate, the more they disagree 10.15.15 | 11:23 AM Basketball Watch Scott Van Pelt set the record straight on Lamar Odom, basketball player not reality TV star 10.15.15 | 10:37 AM Baseball Wake Up With Wilbur: Bat Flip Brings Back Memories 10.15.15 | 9:21 AM Sports Morning Sports Update: Tony Romo tells Tom Brady, ‘See you in February’ 10.15.15 | 8:29 AM Technology Report: Feds questioning legality of daily fantasy sports 10.15.15 | 7:38 AM Baseball #TBT: 50 cent tickets and other things you don’t remember about the 1915 World Series 10.15.15 | 5:51 AM Sports An insider’s guide to Head of the Charles, the essential autumn-in-New-England event 10.15.15 | 5:41 AM Baseball Here’s Don Orsillo’s first day with the San Diego Padres 10.14.15 | 10:34 PM Music RadioBDC Sports: Bruins 0-3? 10.14.15 | 2:43 PM Patriots Oddly enough, hardly any noise has ever been made about the Colts’ cheating suspicions 10.14.15 | 1:50 PM Patriots Report: Nate Solder has torn biceps, will miss rest of season 10.14.15 | 1:33 PM Patriots Bill Belichick doesn’t do much grocery shopping 10.14.15 | 1:18 PM Patriots Tom Brady is the most handsome, and other highlights from Julian Edelman’s Reddit AMA 10.14.15 | 11:46 AM Basketball Rajon Rondo on relationship with new coach: ‘It’s not been going too well’ 10.14.15 | 9:10 AM Red Sox Morning Sports Update: Dave Dombrowski will look for an ace this offseason 10.14.15 | 8:27 AM Soccer Costa Rica shuts down US in friendly 10.14.15 | 12:00 AM Red Sox Springfield mayor opens stadium talks with PawSox 10.13.15 | 9:34 PM Patriots Tom Brady’s dog took an adorable ‘selfie’ 10.13.15 | 3:18 PM Patriots Boston ranks remarkably poorly in ESPN’s four-sport ‘Ultimate Rankings’ 10.13.15 | 3:10 PM Bruins The Bruins honored Travis Roy 20 years after his paralyzing injury 10.13.15 | 2:41 PM", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/search?q=henley&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMIuY2mp5vFyAIVVtNjCh3H1QnJ&amp;biw=1912&amp;bih=996#tbm=isch&amp;q=henley+regatta+dress+code", "http://www.bdcwire.com/radiobdc-sports-bruins-0-3/?p1=stream_", "http://c.o0bc.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BDC/Framework/img/bcom_logo_with_name.png", "http://www.bdcwire.com/radiobdc-sports-pats-prepare-to-crush-colts/?p1=stream_"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:06:27.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
