England manager Roy Hodgson heralded Ross Barkley's improving form after the Everton playmaker was named man of the match following a 2-0 win over Estonia in Euro 2016 qualifying. \nBarkley created Theo Walcott's 45th-minute opener in yesterday's Group E game at Wembley with a beautifully weighted pass and went close to adding a second with a couple of mazy runs and shots before Raheem Sterling got on the score-sheet late on. \nBlooded by Hodgson in the run-up to the 2014 World Cup, Barkley experienced a dip in form last season, but the 21-year-old has made a positive start to the new campaign and the England manger was enthused by his latest display. \n\"I'm pleased Ross got man of the match. We saw what he can do today (Friday),\" Hodgson said. \n\"Like all his managers, I had to work hard on his decision-making as to when he struts his stuff, which is fantastic, and when he plays it more simply. \n\"But that's a coach's job with a very talented young player with lots of ability, (teaching him about) using that ability in the right moments. \n\"I'm quite proud of the fact Ross Barkley is still only 20 (sic), but has been in the national team for over two years, when he's quite often not been in the Everton team. That shows the faith I have in him.\" \nHodgson added: \"Things don't change overnight. It doesn't sink in overnight. He works at it. \n\"I'm sure (Everton manager) Roberto Martinez is working with him, talking to him, and giving him the same instructions. He's learning the lessons, not least by playing at the highest level with Everton and England.\" \nHodgson revealed after the game that captain Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart, Gary Cahill, James Milner and Michael Carrick will all skip Monday's game in Lithuania, when England will look to complete their qualifying campaign with a 10th straight victory. \nRooney missed yesterday's game with an ankle injury, but was present before kick-off to receive a commemorative golden boot from Bobby Charlton for scoring a record 50th England goal last month. \nOpportunities for Butland, Shelvey \nHis Manchester United colleague Carrick has a groin injury, while goalkeeper Hart, centre-back Cahill and midfielder Milner are all being rested. \n\"Gary Cahill has to some extent an occasional back problem,\" Hodgson explained. \n\"We were a bit concerned with a) the flight and b) the artificial pitch (in Vilnius), so in a choice of taking him or (Chris) Smalling, I went with Smalling. \n\"Joe Hart is being left behind against his will because I want to see Jack Butland. And for James Milner, I want to play Jonjo Shelvey in this game. \n\"The rest will do him good and it's the right moment for Jonjo Shelvey to show what he can do again.\" \nCarrick was not included in England's match-day squad for Estonia after failing a fitness test, but Hodgson expects him to be fit for United's next game away at Everton on October 17. \n\"Whether it would have cleared up for Lithuania, I suppose that's open to debate,\" Hodgson said. \n\"We have other players I need to see in that game. From his point of view, and United's, the rest will do him good. I fully expect to see him and Wayne Rooney fully fit for United next weekend.\" \nDefeat left Estonia needing an improbable sequence of events to claim a play-off place, but manager Magnus Pehrsson said his well-drilled team would take heart from their qualifying campaign. \n\"If you look at the development I believe we've had in the last year, if we can have the same this year and even quicker, then we will definitely do everything to qualify for the (2018) World Cup,\" he said. \n\"We are not the favourites, but that should be the aim for us.\" – AFP, October 10,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:19:16.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
