(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) \nKIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Chelsea’s Champions League campaign hit more trouble Tuesday in a frustrating 0-0 draw against Dynamo Kiev in Group G. \nChelsea dominated the game and was unlucky not to score after hitting the woodwork twice through Eden Hazard and Willian. \nOn a chilly night in Ukraine, another good chance was missed by Nemanja Matic, who charged through the Dynamo defense but shot wide. \nThe Ukrainian team came close when Vitaliy Buyalskiy and Derlis Gonzalez forced saves from Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, who late on stopped a dangerous attempt by Junior Moraes. \nAt the halfway point of the group stage, Chelsea is third — one place behind Dynamo.
