It was just the second game Lynch missed in his six seasons with the Seahawks.But Carroll injected an element of optimism when discussing Lynch's status Wednesday.“We're going day-to-day on this thing,” Carroll said. “It will take us all the way to the end of the week before we know. He did make a lot of progress last week and was able to run around some and all that. He's worked really hard at that, so we'll see if we can get it done.”Lynch is one of two Seattle running backs whose status is questionable for Sunday. Third-down back Fred Jackson suffered a sprained ankle in Monday's game and his availability this week is also in the air, though again Carroll expressed some optimism.“Fred looks pretty good,” Carroll said. “He had what we would call a high ankle sprain, but he's getting around OK. It's a little bit of a surprise, we've got to see what that means. It's going to take him all week, too, to figure out whether he can run on it. But he's bouncing around a little bit and he's hopeful he can pull it off.”The only other running back on Seattle's roster is Thomas Rawls. Fullback Derrick Coleman would be next in line for carries should both Lynch and Jackson be unavailable.Seattle had one other starter miss Monday's game as defensive tackle Brandon Mebane sat out with a groin injury. However, Carroll said Mebane should be ready to go Sunday.Cornerback Marcus Burley, who suffered a broken thumb in Monday's game, was scheduled to undergo surgery Thursday. Carroll said Burley could potentially make a “very quick recovery,” though it will depend on how the surgery goes.Decisions on defensive end Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder) and linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis (hamstring), who sat out Monday, will be made later in the week. Cornerback Tharold Simon (toe), who also missed Monday, is not expected back this week.
