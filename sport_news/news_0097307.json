In July, the seven-year-old from Taber, AB joined Winnipeg Blue Bombers Rory Kohlert and Moe Leggett to film a new War Amps PLAYSAFE public service announcement. The PSA will begin airing Saturday, October 10 during TSN's football telecasts and will continue through the CFL® Playoffs and the Grey Cup®.\nFor more than 30 years, The War Amps and the Canadian Football League have shared a special tradition – the annual CFL PLAYSAFE PSA, saluting the League's support of The War Amps kids-to-kids safety program. The connection goes back to the days when the late Karl Hilzinger was The War Amps CHAMP Sports Consultant. \"Karlo\" was a CFL all-star who played for the Ottawa Rough Riders in the '50s. A car accident left him a double-leg amputee. He became an inspiration to Champs and was well-known as the silver-suited skier in War Amps public service announcements. The War Amps and the CFL have been working together ever since to increase awareness of The War Amps PLAYSAFE Program.\n©2015 PR Newswire.
