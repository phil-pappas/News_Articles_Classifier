Both of these teams have done everything to prove their Super Bowl mettle. Let's run down the checklist: \n1. Strong QB play? Check. \n2. At least a serviceable running game? Check. \n3. Excellent head coach? Check. \n4. Defense doing its part? Check. (Sort of. The Packers haven't faced a dynamic offense yet.) \n5. An owner who wears sneakers with suits? Check out Robert Kraft: Boston Globe \nCheck! \nWhile the Packers might have some question marks -- especially if they continue to get battered by the injury bug -- watching the Patriots this season almost makes the AFC playoff race a moot point. \nIs there a team that can block the Patriots' path to the Super Bowl? Lemme think on this: true \nThe Steelers? Sorry, their defense gives me nightmares. The Broncos? Solid defense, but still . . . we've seen the Peyton Manning vs. Tom Brady in the playoffs movie before. I'm taking Brady. \nThe Bengals? While I love how Andy Dalton has looked this season, don't forget they looked the part after four games in 2014 and we all saw how that ended. I need to see the Bengals win at least one playoff game before I even consider picking them to beat New England. \nBut . . . there is one team that intrigues me. What about the Jets? That defensive front seven with Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie on the outside? Now before you do a spit-take and laugh at me, the Jets are currently 3-1. If they actually reach the postseason, they would only have to be better than the Patriots on one day. And that would be the third time they would face each other this season. You start to figure out the way a team ticks after seeing them that often. \nA team with a defensive maven -- Todd Bowles -- as their head coach could certainly find a way to figure out the Patriots' formula. In fact, it's been done before: true \nAgain, I'm not saying it's going to happen, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did. And guess what? We'll get a sneak preview of a potential playoff matchup in Week 7, when these two teams face off for the first time. Let's see how it goes. And at that point, if the Patriots roll to a 47-0 victory, you'll be free to point and laugh at my stupidity. true \nOK, let's check out some other picks. \nWHAT ELSE YOU GOT?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:40:59.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
