Naomi Hickman and Rachel Hickman were hitting so well … blocks, everything was on. Passing was great, and we were just having a really good night.” \nWhile Friedrichsen manned the baseline, Johnson moved about freely to help the Firebirds’ offense flow. Johnson recorded 21 assists in the victories and made a few digs that led to big rallies by the Firebirds.

She is my second libero, essentially, so her defense is something that we need to have.” \nOnce Johnson was able to feed the Hickman sisters at the net, Naomi and Rachel were able to use their height advantage against the Pioneers and Vikings to put it away. \n“It was fun setting them,” Johnson said of Naomi and Rachel, who stand 6-foot-5 and 6-3, respectively. “They were just putting stuff down. They knew what to do with the ball.” \nThe Firebirds did not trail in the first set of either match and only fell behind 1-0 in the second to SM West. FSHS was tested in the middle to late stages of each second set, though, but did not back down. The Pioneers pulled within 23-22, and the Vikings rallied from seven points down to tie it at 22, before the Firebirds closed out each match.

We never got worried or anything,” Friedrichsen said. “We just kept playing, and we were just in control the whole night. At least, I never felt out of control of anything.” \nFriedrichsen fueled the Firebirds in crunch time against the Vikings, with four of her team-high six aces coming against SM West. The senior quartet of Friedrichsen, Johnson, Allie Knapp and Rebekah Andersson have helped the Firebirds to a 17-9 mark with five regular-season competitions remaining and have also made life easier on Hoffsommer. \n“They’ve been dedicated since last March when I became their coach and we began the process,” said Hoffsomer, who is in her first full season of coaching the Firebirds. “I really appreciate all of the hard work and effort that they have put in. I’m happy that they were able to have such a great Senior Night.” \nThe Firebirds’ second triangular sweep has them full of confidence going into their next tri, Tuesday at St. Teresa, and for the remainder of the season. \n“We are in a pretty good position (for sub-state) because we don’t have any of the Olathe schools, like Olathe East, Olathe Northwest or Blue Valley,” Friedrichsen said. “We’re in a very good position for sub-state. I think we’re on a road to state, so I’m very excited.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:53:58.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
