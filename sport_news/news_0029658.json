After taking the initial lead, the Knights couldn’t hold on and fell to 0-8 on the season. Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow WOODSTOCK — After taking advantage of a pair of first half turnovers, Cass cruised to a 33-12 victory Friday in a Region 7 (A) game at River Ridge.Down 14-6 and driving down the field, Knights running back Tremain Carr had the ball stripped from him as he was being held up in a pile. Boo Reed picked the ball up and streaked down the field 58 yards to push Cass’ lead to 21-6.Two plays later, River Ridge (0-8, 0-5) added to its own woes when an errant snap rolled right by quarterback Marcus Spears and out of the back of the end zone for a safety.“The turnover resulting in a touchdown was terrible.” River Ridge coach Tyler Wynn said. “That’s tough, but you play the next play.”After Cass (5-3, 3-2) pushed its margin to 23-6, the Knights’ defense stiffened up, keeping the Colonels off the scoreboard in the third quarter, but the improved defensive effort proved to be too little, too late.“You find out where a kid’s character is when you’re going through struggles like this, especially the struggles our defense has had,” Wynn said. “We saw (Friday) that these guys have some character. They got down, they got beat up a little bit, but they stuck to it.”For the third game in a row, River Ridge drove the field for a touchdown on its opening offensive drive. Spears led the Knights down the field, completing six of six passes for 70 yards, including a 5-yard touchdown pass to Wesley Terry. However, River Ridge’s offense was unable to maintain that success as it couldn’t find the end zone again until late in the fourth quarter.“It’s execution,” Wynn said. “We just missed some big opportunities. We felt like we had a good scheme going into it and we had some things that we felt like would be there. They were there and we weren’t able to execute.”Cass responded in quick fashion when, on its second offensive play, running back James Darns raced 57 yards to give the Colonels a lead they never relinquished.River Ridge receiver Davis Polley was a bright spot, as the senior caught nine passes for 140 yards.“Are we happy with the result? No. Am I happy with the effort? Yes. That’s something we can build on moving forward,” Wynn said. “Just executing on the offensive side and making tackles on the defensive side, I feel like our guys did better (Friday), but we still got a long ways to go.”The Knights will travel to Creekview next week, still in search of their first victory of the season.Cass will travel to Rome, with the winner clinching the subregion’s No. 3 seed and an opportunity to play for a state playoff berth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:13:23.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
