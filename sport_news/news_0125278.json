Recruits gathered on the field. People tailgating in the grass and parking lot areas.. Children getting photos taken. And a football game being staged. \n\"It is a Norman Rockwell moment,\" said UWF athletic director Dave Scott. \"There could not be a better day for the University of West Florida.\" \nOn a cloudless day, the Argos produced their postcard image. UWF football eager for grand stage \nThe players put on a show. They played the kind of game they wanted in a 26-25 victory for the Blue Team against the White Team in front of 3,116 fans at the converted Blue Wahoos Stadium. There was 702 yards offense, 0 fumbles, 2 interceptions, several long runs and great catches, few penalties, some hits that elicited a crowd reaction and a future on Fetterman Field that is now secure. \n\"To have this type of crowd, this type of atmosphere,, this type of weather.... kudos to (UWF president) Dr. (Judy) Bense for her vision to make this what it is,\" said UWF coach Pete Shinnick following the game. \nYes, for sure. Just as Quint and Rishy Studer made Blue Wahoos baseball happen and forever changed downtown, Judy Bense and her determination against resistance has forever changed UWF by making football happen. It will impact in so many ways beyond football. UWF scrimmage ends with players greeting fans \n\"It is right out of a storybook,\" said Bense, during halftime, after she participated in the midfield coin toss with team captains prior to the kickoff. \"It is so satisfying.. I am so happy. I always thought the hard work of a university should be wrapped around a bundle of fun. And this is a fun thing.\" \nIt was quite the prelude to the Argos' 2016 season debut as Gulf South Conference members. The fans could see the future. They saw Jaylon Hamer from Orlando rush for 85 yards and one touchdown. They saw quarterback Mike Beaudry from Oviedo complete 12 of 21 passes for 222 yards and two touchdowns, no interceptions while taking snaps for both teams. \nThey saw placekicker Austin Peffers, a Panama City Arnold graduate, make five of six field goals from short distance, long distance, infield dirt and into swirling wind. UWF's first scrimmage attracts crowd \nThis is what college football looks like up close, the way so many people got to see it. The day began when more than two hours before the 11 a.m. scrimmage with the arrival of team buses and the first \"Argo Walk\" of the players entering the stadium. \n\"I saw my mom standing there and I really started tearing up,\" Beaudry said.. \"I gave her a big hug. It was emotional. Everyone has been working for this moment to play college football and it's just a blessing to be out here with these guys. \n\"All these fans supporting us.. you cannot ask for anything else.\" \nThe setting is something you cannot ask for anything better. \nWhich is why UWF really needs to make Blue Wahoos Stadium their home field forever. To be sure, there are tweaks to be made. \nThe plan for next season is temporary bleachers in right field area. That brings more people closer to sideline. The field needs completely sodded to cover the infield and warning track in the outfield where the other end zone is situated. Maybe some look at bringing even more people into sideline views, \nBut there is too much else that is great about playing downtown in this beautiful stadium with Pensacola Bay as the backdrop and all of Palafox Street offerings in walking distance. \nIt is a location that very few college football venues can match. What's more, the stadium is already in UWF colors with blue and silver as the two main themes. \n\"I was walking around the parking lot earlier in the morning, talking to people and they were saying they went to (restaurants) Ruby Slipper, Nick's Boathouse and all these other places,\" Scott said. \"This is just a beautiful environment and what a unique experience.\" \nThe easy part for UWF will always be assembling the football talent. While this team will need to grow and take initial lumps in the GSC, which is one of the elite conferences in NCAA Division II, the Argos will get there. \n\"Every recruit that was here... and we had a handful from a lot of areas.... and they were like, \"Wow, this is beautiful. Wow this is amazing,\" Shinnick said. \"We are so thankful the city the Blue Wahoos, have given us the opportunity to be down here.. \n\"Because it is a great selling point. And now all these people here who watched us play.... they have to go somewhere to watch a football game (rest of day) and they are probably going downtown, buying a meal and enjoying themselves.\" \nThe first two scrimmages, UWF kept its play-calling basic and was trying to build for Saturday. It showed. Receiver Mike Syrakis made a terrific leaping touchdown catch in the corner of the end zone for the first score. Kevin Grant from Melbourne caught a 78-yard bomb from Beaudry for another score. \nPeffers had his best day kicking and really showed his potential as a dependable field goal kicker. \n\"I had never kicked on (infield) dirt before,\" he said. \"It's not too difficult, but you do slide a little bit more. It is such a nice field..The wind is a factor here. The one I missed, the wind was that way..\" \nAll part of the experience of playing in this setting. An hour before the scrimmage, the parking lot was already full outside the stadium. Tailgate tents were up. UWF had students greeting fans. Information about the university and season tickets were available. \n\"There were alumni here from 1969 our first graduating class,\" Bense said. There were alumni here from 20 years ago, 10 years ago, all different classes. And they all said the same thing... I never thought I would see this day.\" \nIt happened Saturday. UWF will see the impact forever. \nSCORING SUMMARY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:52:51.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
