Macius can participate in the process to select a hearing officer. The hearing is closed to the public unless either Macius or District 115 wants it open to the public and the hearing officer agrees. The hearing has to start within 75 days and conclude within 120 days after the appointment of the hearing officer. Post-hearing briefs must be submitted within 21 days of the conclusion of the hearing.\nA student reported that on May 11 a math teacher had come to her home and made \"inappropriate physical contact\" with her according to previous Chicago Tribune articles. The Lake County News Sun reported police said Macius allegedly kissed the student on the neck and rubbed her leg without her consent.\nMacius was charged with two misdemeanor counts of battery on July 20 according to the Lake County Clerk of the Circuit Court website. He pleaded not guilty on Aug. 3, said Cynthia Vargas of the Lake County State's Attorney's office. His next hearing is scheduled for Oct. 29.\nBoth counts are punishable by up to one year in county jail – to be served concurrently – and/or a fine of up to $2,500 according to a July interview with Michael Ori, chief of traffic, misdemeanor and felony traffic at the State's Attorney office.\nThe Lake Forester was unable to contact Macius. His attorney, Thomas Breen, did not return calls by deadline.\nmlawton@pioneerlocal.com\n@reporterdude\n Crime Lake Forest", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562024cb/turbine/ct-lfr-macius-tl-1022-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:05:43.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
