Others to be honored include 2013 PGA Golf Professional of the Year Michael Doctor and 2014 winner Ray Cutright, and former University of Texas coach George Hannon. \"It is with great pride that the PGA of America welcomes this exceptional class, who by their achievements have made significant and lasting contributions to our Association and the game of golf,\" PGA president Derek Sprague said. \n\n\"They represent individuals who were passionate leaders, stood strong against social injustice, inspired young players to greater heights and whose performance on the course is remembered for generations.\" \n\nTrevino, inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1981, captured the 1968 and 1971 US Opens, the 1971 and 1972 British Opens and the 1974 and 1984 PGA Championships, but was never better than 10th in 20 Masters starts. Sifford, who died in February aged 92, was the first African American on the US PGA Tour. He won the 1967 Greater Hartford Open and 1969 Los Angeles Open and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2004. \n\nSifford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom last year and was among those that 14-time major champion Tiger Woods cites as an inspiration. Stewart died in a 1999 plane crash at age 42, just four months after winning the US Open. He also won the 1991 US Open and 1989 PGA Championship. Bolt, who died in 2008 aged 92, was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2002. \n\nHe beat South African star Gary Player by four shots at Southern Hills for his only major title. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2001.
