(AP) - Police say they have launched an investigation into a sexually explicit group chat exchange between members of a Connecticut varsity football team forced to forfeit their next game because of their cyber activity. \nThe child pornography investigation was opened Thursday night after a new video shared among Plainfield High School football players surfaced. \nPolice say the video is separate from the incident involving the team sharing inappropriate photos of underage girls on the cellphone app “WhatsApp.” \nPrincipal Jim Worth says school officials are conducting an internal investigation as well. \nPolice say the video may be considered inappropriate depending upon the age and knowledge of those involved. \nUnder Connecticut law, teens who share nude or sexually explicit images and video of people under 16 may face felony criminal charges. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:21:45.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
