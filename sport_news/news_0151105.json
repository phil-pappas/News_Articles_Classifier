Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By T.D. Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 9:00 PM By T.D. Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 9:00 PM There are times, dear reader, that your old pal T.D. starts feeling a little claustrophobic in this space. Now, don’t get me wrong. T.D. is proud to write the finest weekly pick-em column in the state of Massachusetts, this season’s mediocre-by-Pointer-standards start notwithstanding. The beginning of the year is always challenging, but 30-26 just ain’t gonna cut it for this pigskin prognosticator. But I digress. Sometimes Pointer feels like he has more to offer. It can be hard to bring the best in high school football analysis just once a week. It’s a new world we’re living in, and sometimes you have to change with the times. And that’s why, in April of 2014, Pointer had a stroke of genius. That’s when T.D’s favorite late night host, David Letterman, announced he was calling it a career. Pointer has always been a Letterman guy. Jay Leno had the look of an NFL linebacker, but Letterman always had the grouchy demeanor of an old ball coach — the Bear Bryant of late night TV. Pointer liked his style. Then the lightbulb went on. CBS was looking for a replacement — why shouldn’t Pointer throw his helmet in the ring? Think about it. Bringing the glory of MetroWest football analysis to a national audience. It would be a ratings boon. Couldn’t fail. And not to toot my own horn, but T.D. has always been told he had the good looks and enchanting charisma to make Johnny Carson blush. Now, T.D. understands it’s a national gig. He’d have the requisite movie stars and A-list celebrities, though mostly relegated to the offseason. He’d do his due diligence. But think about it — a perfect, crisp Thursday night in October. The Late Show with T.D. Pointer. Tonight’s guests — Holliston coach Todd Kiley and Wellesley quarterback Jake Mohan. Special musical guest, the Framingham High School marching band. It would have been a thing of glory, my fellow football fanatics. Kiley, for instance, could talk about how he plans to attack a Westwood team that came back from a 20-point deficit last week to top Hopkinton 22-20. It’s entirely possible the Tri-Valley League title will be decided on Friday night. Talk about riveting television, played out, of course, by the Late Night fight song. Alas, dear readers, you know how this story turns out. T.D. made his pitch to the bigwigs at CBS, but ultimately it was not to be. They went with Stephen Colbert, who Pointer will admit is doing a bang-up job. He’s a talented guy. A little lacking in football expertise, but I guess no one is perfect. Page 2 of 2 - Anyway, Pointer is still searching for a home for his Late Night passion project. Word on the street is Brian Pahlm at Natick Public Access might be interested — feel free to give T.D. a call. Until then, you can find me here, your trusty pal T.D., every week. On to the picks. We’ll start with the game of the week, Holliston at Westwood, a matchup of the Tri-Valley League’s finest. Holliston is young but finding ways to win, while Westwood is coming off a critical aforementioned win at Hopkinton. The Wolverines are seriously talented, but Pointer likes Holliston to keep its perfect record intact. Elsewhere in the TVL, Dover-Sherborn will also keep its perfect record alive with a win over Bellingham. Hopkinton took a tough loss last week, but bounces back with a victory at Medway. Ashland took its first loss last week and will look to get back on track at Medfield, but unfortunately for the Clockers, Pointer is picking Medfield to win. Millis-Hopedale got its first win of the season last week, and Pointer likes Millis-Hopedale to ride that momentum into a win at Norton. In the Bay State Conference, the stingy Wellesley defense keeps the good times rolling, leading the Raiders to a win at Dedham. The struggles continue for a young Natick team which can’t defend its home field against Milton . In Central Mass., Hudson took a tough loss last week but gets back on track with a win at Algonquin. In Hockomock League matchups, Milford proves victorious against a winless Oliver Ames, while Franklin falls at North Attleborough . In the Dual County League, Wayland edges Concord-Carlisle at its home field, but Lincoln-Sudbury can’t do the same against Westford Academy . Wrapping up Friday night’s action, Marian-Keefe Tech wins a tight game against Matignon, Nashoba Tech beats Assabet, St. Bernard’s tops Nipmuc and Blue Hills bests Tri-County. Moving on to Saturday, Framingham remains winless with a loss to Braintree at Framingham State. Marlborough stays hot with a win at Westborough. Blackstone-Millville gets a victory at home against Worcester South. In a tightly contested game, Valley Tech comes out on top against Worcester Tech. In a SWCL matchup, Uxbridge earns a win against Bartlett. Last week: 12-5 T.D. Pointer is a Daily News Correspondent. By T.D. Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By T.D.
