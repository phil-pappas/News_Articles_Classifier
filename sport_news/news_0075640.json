Here are three stories worthy of your clicks this morning. Tristan Thompson ends months-long holdout over relatively minuscule dollar figure \nFor the majority of us, $2 million is a gigantic sum of money. Understandably, things operate on a slightly different scale in a league like the NBA, where the majority of players earn that much every season — a select few earn it every month. \nSo to a normal person, the announcement of Tristan Thompson's extension agreement with the Cleveland Cavaliers Wednesday seemed mostly routine. #Cavs , Tristan Thompson agree to 5-year, $82 million deal, league sources tell @clevelanddotcom . — Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) October 21, 2015 \nHere's the thing, though. Thompson's signing ended a several-month holdout from Cleveland, one marked by both sides playing every leverage card in their respective hands as Thompson and his agent looked to maximize his power while the Cavs looked to keep their mammoth luxury tax bill as low as possible. \nIt was strange to many involved, then, that when the two sides finally came to an agreement, the final number — five years, $82 million — was just $2 million higher than the standing offer Cleveland reportedly had sitting on the table for weeks. Was all the missed training camp time, the awkwardness with his teammates and the potential bad blood between Thompson and the organization really worth it for a difference that amounted to 2.5 percent of the initial offer, and over a four-year period at that? Giants tight end gets precious welcome home from children following hospital stay \nStaph infections are no fun. No one knows that better than New York Giants tight end Daniel Fells, who spent weeks in the hospital since early October fighting an MRSA infection. \nFells was released back home Wednesday, however, and what came next surely eased the heartache of being away from home to a pretty large degree. \nWell, I don't know about anyone else, but my cuteness quotient for the week was met and exceeded in that 15 seconds alone. Royals pitcher cleverly trolls Toronto sports fans \nThe Toronto Blue Jays' postseason has had no shortage of drama, including a couple vital plays involving instant replay. Most notable among these came last round when the penultimate game of Toronto's division series against Texas was nearly decided by a bizarre replay review before Jose Bautista rectified things with the greatest bat flip of all time . \nAn unfortunate consequence of that game's replay decision was that, before Bautista homered and sent the crowd into a happy frenzy, Toronto's fans didn't exactly behave themselves. After the replay review went in Texas' favor, Jays fans began tossing objects onto the field in frustration, including beers and other beverages. Things only calmed down after some time and with several Jays players begging the crowd to stop. \nThe Blue Jays have moved on to the next round, but their new opponents seem to have been watching the last round's theatrics. When a replay review was initiated in the second inning of Tuesday's ALCS game between Kansas City and Toronto, Royals pitcher Jeremy Guthrie poked a little clever fun at Toronto's fans. \nSports are just that much better with a little gamesmanship involved, aren't they?
