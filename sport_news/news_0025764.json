Now, as classes resumed, students and faculty began the long trudge toward normalcy. But they wouldn't do it alone.\nDouglas County sheriff's deputies initially asked Roseburg residents not to line the winding, narrow road that leads to the campus. It was too dangerous, they said. After a day of thinking, authorities changed their minds. Students and faculty needed to see their neighbors as they returned.\n\"This is a very strong and resilient community,\" said Gov. Kate Brown, who delayed a trip to Asia on Saturday to be on campus Monday. \"They will provide the support these students need to move forward.\"\nAnd so the neighbors came in darkness to set up tables of donuts and coffee. Pacific Power crews hoisted a 30-by-60-foot U.S. flag. Others waved small flags or held out signs as the sun rose and the first cars began crawling toward campus.\nSome drivers waved, but mostly, they wiped away tears as those on the sidelines shaped their fingers into hearts. Grown men drove the mile slowly, sobbing in their pickup trucks.\nJennifer Kramer tried to smile back. She recognized so many of the devastated students.\n\"He was in the classroom until five minutes before,\" she said as one vehicle passed.\n\"He was shot in the hand,\" she said as another did.\nLike so many in Roseburg, Kramer and her family members attended Umpqua Community College.\n\"Our hearts mourn when these things happen across the country, but to have it actually happen in your own community,\" she said, pausing for several seconds. She waved, smiled as big as she could at a car full of young women driving past.\n\"It's horrific,\" Kramer said.\n Across the street, Harl Clark cried alone. He is 75, a former soldier, local police officer and insurance broker. He had arrived at 6:30 a.m. with 300 flags. Now, he held one and tried to choke back tears as the cars passed. His town needed him.\n\"We feel like we are in a bubble of love,\" Umpqua interim president Rita Cavin said.\nPaul Eckel, who is studying to become a paramedic, walked the line, shaking hands and thanking those who had come.\n\"It's beautiful,\" said Eckel, a former U.S. Army infantryman who now serves as president of the school's veterans group. \"It's small-town USA powerful.\"\nEckel hopes to return the favor. He's planning whitewater and hiking excursions for any student, faculty or person affected by the violence. As someone who has seen death and tragedy in war zones, he knows from experience that Oregon's outdoors can help to heal.\nMelinda Benton wasn't sure how she could help her students heal. Most of the 18 students in her morning technical writing class arrived in somber moods, Benton said. The assistant communications professor started with food, bagels and cream cheese and nuts. Then she \"got right into the lesson,\" she said.\n\"The hardest part other than just dealing with the trauma is feeling responsible for others in terms of mental health,\" Benton said.\nMany students aren't ready to return yet, Cavin said.\nTuesday, another collection of students will return for the first time since the shootings.\nBrandon Tafea Polamalu, the brother of NFL star Troy Polamalu, will take over Lawrence Levine's classes. L evine was killed when the gunman entered his Writing 115 class and began shooting.\nPolamalu, a poet, has taught writing classes at the school before, but he had transitioned to counseling this year.\nRobert Leo Heilman, a well known writer from Myrtle Creek, will join Polamalu. Heilman did his \"entire college career\" at Umpqua, a single writing class in 1981. He went on to have a distinguished career as an essayist. He's read in front of crowds and told live folk stories. None of that has prepared him for the talk he will give Tuesday.\n\"How can we make this tragedy comprehensible?\" he asked himself over the weekend.\nFinally, he settled on teaching students the process he uses every morning: They will write stream-of-consciousness style. Then they will throw away their writing.\n\"It's a way of telling it to the well,\" Heilman said. \"When you write stuff out, eventually you get down to the emotional stuff. If we are to come out of this, we need a story, a story to survive, a story to heal.\"\nDenis Theriault of The Oregonian/OregonLive staff contributed to this report.\n-- Casey Parks\ncparks@oregonian.com\n503-221-8271\n@caseyparks\n-- Tony Hernandez\nthernandez@oregonian.com\n503-294-5928\n@tonyhreports", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/tonyhreports", "https://twitter.com/caseyparks"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:04:27.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
