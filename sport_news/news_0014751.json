The 6-foot-4, 205-pound senior has carried 29 times for 400 yards and five touchdowns. \n\"His decision-making, even early on, was very good,\" Bret Stover said. \"And he's really become a student of the game. He's good at making adjustments.\" \nThe red-hot Cardinals, who have outscored foes by 288-24, visit conference rival Plymouth Whitemarsh (5-1, 2-1) at 7 p.m. Friday. \nLast season, Stover passed for 2,187 yards and 21 touchdowns while helping Upper Dublin go 11-2, win the conference title, and advance to the PIAA District 1 Class AAAA semifinals. \nToward the end of last year, Bret Stover, a health and physical education teacher at Upper Dublin, allowed Ryan to sometimes call his own plays. \"Not a lot of high school quarterbacks get that chance, so I welcomed it,\" Ryan said. \nOf the football relationship he has with his father, the 17-year-old said, \"He doesn't treat me any differently than our other players. But he expects a little more of me as a team leader and captain.\" \nIn the offseason, Ryan Stover participated in camps at Delaware, Kutztown, Richmond, Lehigh, Pittsburgh, and Temple. No BCS or FBS offer came from the trips. \nTowson recently became the first FBS program to offer a scholarship. \"I was very happy that something finally happened,\" said Ryan Stover, who plans to major in accounting in college. \nDelaware, Colgate, Holy Cross, Richmond, and William and Mary have expressed varying degrees of interest. \nFor now, the Stovers are focused on duplicating or bettering last year's record-setting campaign. \n\"I've watched so many of our guys play together since they were 7 or 8 years old,\" Bret Stover said. \"That's one of the exciting parts about this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:07:57.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
