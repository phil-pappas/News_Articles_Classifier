Utes host Bears amid plenty of pomp and circumstance GameDay is quite the day in Utah UTAH GAMEDAY vs. California Utah video: Homecoming week pep rally, Paul ready to 'bear hunt' “ I’ve never coached in Salt Lake City. I hear it’s a loud stadium. I’m sure it’s going to be a great atmosphere.”\nCalifornia coach Sonny Dykes\nSALT LAKE CITY — Utah’s 34th-consecutive sellout at Rice-Eccles Stadium isn’t something California coach Sonny Dykes wants his team to fret over. A packed house will be on hand for Saturday’s showdown between No. 5 Utah and No. 23 California.\n“I’ve never coached in Salt Lake City. I hear it’s a loud stadium,” he said. “I’m sure it’s going to be a great atmosphere.”\nEven so, Dykes believes it's better for the Bears to just worry about doing their jobs.\n“I told them before we played Texas, I’ve never seen a crowd score a touchdown,” Dykes said at his weekly press conference. “I’ve never seen a crowd make a tackle.”\nDykes then joked about the infamous Cal-Stanford game in 1982.\n“I saw a band almost make a tackle here many years ago,” he said.\nCENTER OF ATTENTION: ESPN’s “College GameDay” has taken over the grounds on Presidents Circle. Students began camping out for Saturday morning’s show on Thursday.\n“It adds a bunch of energy to what we’re doing for the community and the university. It’s an honor to have those guys come into town,” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said earlier in the week, adding that it’s a plus if handled the right way. “You can’t let it distract you. You can’t let it become your focal point, but as far as ‘amping up’ our fan base and exposure for our university, it’s great. We’d like to have ‘GameDay’ here every week if they wanted to come here every week. We see it as a big positive.”\nUPON ARRIVAL: “College GameDay” host Rece Davis met with the local media up on the hill Friday afternoon. The show returns to Salt Lake City for the first time since 2010 and the third time overall — 2004 being the other year.\n“Everybody does a great job of hosting us,” he said. “But I do think there’s a little extra adrenalin among the fans and the vibe that you can feel in the community when you come to a place where ‘GameDay’ hasn’t been there in a long time.”\nSMALL SURPRISE: Although small in stature — at 5 foot 8 and 166 pounds — true freshman Britain Covey is Utah’s leading receiver after four games with 17 catches.\nWide receivers coach Taylor Stubblefield acknowledged that Covey surprises people.\n“At the end of the day you don’t see a lot of 5 foot 8, 160-pound guys playing in the Pac-12. You just don’t see that and so when you go off of percentages, the percentages are not in his favor,” said Stubblefield, who noted it's sometimes difficult to evaluate heart, character and determination in recruiting. “That’s one thing that Covey has better than anybody.”\nStubblefield added that Covey is quick, smart and catches the ball.\n“All of those things make him a really good player,” he said.\nContributing: Amy Donaldson \nEmail: dirk@desnews.com \nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:04:31.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
