The games where things don't go our way, we've got to handle them better. You've got handle those situations better.\" \nWhat's interesting is this was the first game this season where the Giants didn't have a chance to win. They lost to Dallas and Atlanta in the opening two games, giving up late touchdowns. They beat Washington, Buffalo and the 49ers in close games. \nWith first place on the line and a chance to open a two-game lead over Washington and Philadelphia in the division, the Giants did very little after an impressive 80-yard touchdown drive to open the game. \nIf Coughlin had taken out a pad, he could have made a long list of everything that went wrong. \nWith a 7-0 first-quarter lead, tight end Larry Donnell was stripped by linebacker DeMeco Ryans after getting two hands on a pass near the Eagles 20. The play was an interception instead of either a 10 or 14-point lead. \nOn the next series, defensive end Damontre Moore is called for a very late and senseless roughing the passer penalty on a third-and-10. The drive stays alive and Sam Bradford hits Riley Cooper for touchdown on a play in which a defensive back blew a coverage. \nNolan Carroll's pick-6 on a bad pass by Eli Manning gave Philadelphia the lead in the second quarter and the Giants never looked threatening again, especially with the offensive line being manhandled by the Eagles' front four. \nA running into the kicker penalty — one of a dozen overall against New York — kept a third-quarter Eagles' drive alive and resulted in DeMarco Murray's touchdown run. \nThe bottom line was the Giants contributed 21 points to the Eagles and failed to generate a point off the four turnovers they caused. \n\"Frustration? Yeah, no question about, you can sense it in my voice,\" Coughlin said. \"Especially when you've got a day where you don't have your team around here. You've got tape to look at and the coaches to talk with, but at the same time, because of the nature of the week, you've got to move on to the next opponent. You've got to get moving.\" \nThe Giants can't afford a repeat performance. They play host to the Cowboys on Sunday and they certainly don't want to lose both games to Dallas, especially if the division title comes down to a tiebreaker. \n\"It did not turn out the way we wanted it to,\" Coughlin said. \"I'm sure that knowing in our locker room the number of people that take great pride in what they do and the way we felt about it afterward, we're going to have to come bouncing back.\" \nThe Giants didn't bounce back last year after being shut out in Philadelphia in the sixth game last season. They went on a seven-game losing streak in missing the playoffs for the third straight year. \n\"That was last year, this is a new year,\" Coughlin said., \"What am I worried about? I'm worried about getting our team ready for the Dallas Cowboys. Forget about last year. Last year was last year.\" \nNOTES: The Giants have waived safety Cooper Taylor. Taylor played in three games this season, including Monday night. A fifth-round draft choice in 2013, he spent last season on injured reserve with a foot injury. Taylor was given a chance to win a starting job in training camp when New York did not re-sign Antrel Rolle, Quintin Demps or Stevie Brown. However, he had a couple of minor injuries in camp and lost the starting job to rookie Landon Collins and veteran Brandon Meriweather. ... Coughlin was not sure whether offensive tackle Will Beatty (pectoral) would start working out this week. He has been on the reserve/physically unable to perform list. ... There was no update on receiver Victor Cruz, who is still bothered by a calf injury. He has not practiced since mid-August. ... Defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul is expected to have his injured hand examined by the Giants for a second time. Coughlin said he'll talk about that after it happens. \nOnline: \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:16:17.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
