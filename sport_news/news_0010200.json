After a series of scary-looking images including Islamic State militants, an announcer declares, \"The world is a dangerous place. We need a tough, strong leader.\"\nIt then cuts to video of Sanders being interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters at an event, accompanies by circus music, as the announcer says, \"And it's not this guy.\"\nWhile the two stand at very different sides of the ideological spectrum, their positions, including denouncing certain free trade deals and railing against the influence of money in politics, sometimes overlap.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:10:28.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
