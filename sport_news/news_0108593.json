Tunisia is the only country in the region to painstakingly build a democracy, involving a range of political and social forces in dialogue to create a constitution, legislature and democratic institutions.\n\"More than anything, the prize is intended as an encouragement to the Tunisian people, who despite major challenges have laid the groundwork for a national fraternity which the committee hopes will serve as an example to be followed by other countries,\" committee chair Kaci Kullmann Five said.\nThe National Dialogue Quartet is made up of four key organizations in Tunisian civil society: the Tunisian General Labour Union ; the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts; the Tunisian Human Rights League ; and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers .\nKullmann Five said the prize was for the quartet as a whole, not the four individual organizations.\nThe decision came as a surprise to many, with speculation having focused on Europe's migrant crisis or the Iran-U.S. nuclear deal in July.\n\"It is a very good prize that tries to get into the heart of the conflict in the Muslim world,\" said Oeyvind Stenersen , a Nobel historian. \"But it was a bit bewildering. It was very unexpected.\"\nThere were 273 candidates nominated for the 2015 peace prize, five fewer than in 2014.\nThe award capped a week of Nobel Prize announcements, with the winners of the medicine, physics, chemistry and literature awards presented earlier in Stockholm.\nThe economics award — not an original Nobel Prize but created in 1968 — will be announced on Monday.\n___\nRitter reported from Stockholm.
