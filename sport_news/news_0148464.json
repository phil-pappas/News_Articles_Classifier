Edwards defeated Thompson Valley’s Tony Klagge 6-0, 6-0 in the opening round of the tournament. “It was a great match for Fred,” Durango head coach Dave Weisfeldt said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “Fred was consistent, and his talent was too much for the other guy to handle.” In the quarterfinal match, Edwards ran into one of the best players in the state, Casey Ross from Kent Denver. The Bayfield High School junior got off to a slow start for the Demons. Ross took the first set 6-1 and won the second set 6-3 to finish the match. Though Edwards can’t win the state title, he is able to compete in a consolation round and could finish as high as third place if Ross advances to the finals. “It’s been a great atmosphere here,” Weisfeldt said. “We’re confident that Ross is going to win, so we’re hoping that Fred has a few more matches in him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:55:56.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
