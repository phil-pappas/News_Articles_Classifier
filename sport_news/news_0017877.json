By STEPHEN HAWKINSAP Sports Writers \nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Troy Tulowitzki drove in four runs, including a three-run homer for his first hit this postseason, and the Toronto Blue Jays avoided elimination in the AL Division Series with a 5-1 win over the Texas Rangers in Game 3 on Sunday night. \nThe Blue Jays cut their deficit to 2-1 in the best-of-five matchup. \nTexas has another chance Monday to clinch the series at home. If not, a deciding Game 5 will be played Wednesday in Toronto, where the Rangers won the first two games. \nMarco Estrada limited the Rangers to one run and five hits over 6 1-3 innings. \nTulowitzki's two-out homer in the sixth put the Blue Jays up 5-0. That was two innings after he drew a bases-loaded walk. \nTexas left-hander Martin Perez, somewhat a surprise pick as the Game 3 starter over veterans Derek Holland and Colby Lewis, gave up four runs and six hits. \nHolland (4-3) starts Game 4 against knuckleballer R.A. Dickey (11-11). Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
