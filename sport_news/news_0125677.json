We have people in different spots on the back row. We've ended up with playmakers in spots to make plays.\" \nThursday's winners will meet at 11 a.m. Saturday in a sectional semifinal. Centerville and Northeastern each drew byes and will play in the second semifinal at 12:30 p.m. \nSaturday's championship is at 7 p.m. The only guarantee? The Sectional 41 champion will come from the TEC. \n\"I think the TEC is as strong as it's been in a long time,\" said Lincoln coach Greg Seidner. \n\"It's going to be a battle and it's going to be a really strong, competitive (tournament).\" \nWinchester coach Julie Smiley is looking to forward to hosting the tournament in the Falcons' new high school gym -- and to seeing familiar faces in the postseason. Previously, Winchester played in a different sectional, while Eastern Hancock and Knightstown were among the Sectional 41 field. \n\"Usually we play teams we haven't even seen all year,\" Smiley said of now being in an all-TEC postseason tournament. \"I think it will definitely be more strategic, just because we know so much about each other.\" \nHagerstown's last time on Winchester's floor was a good one for the Tigers. They swept the Falcons there this past Thursday to complete a perfect 7-0 run in the TEC, winning the championship for the first time since 1991. \n\"We have to come out ready to play and bring the intensity,\" said Hagerstown coach Brian Dale. \"If we don't, we'll be scratching our heads, wondering what happened.\" \nThe Sectional 41 winner will host the Sectional 42 champion on Oct. 27 in a regional final. \nUnion County defeated Hagerstown in last year's final, then went on to earn a return trip to semistate. \nThe Patriots are taking it one match at a time in the postseason. \n\"We know Winchester is going to want it. They are the host team and the home team,\" Spurlock said. \"We expect a battle Thursday night.\" \nAnother area team aiming for a repeat is Seton Catholic. \nThe Cardinals open play in Class A Sectional 56 at Randolph Southern on Thursday with a 7:30 p.m. match vs. the host Rebels. \nBlue River plays Tri High in Thursday's first match at 6. Union and Union City each received a bye and will play in Saturday's semifinal round. \nThe championship is 7 p.m. Saturday. \n\"They’d love to repeat at sectionals,\" said Seton coach Jennifer Martin. \"That’s something we’d talked about. It was a great win to win sectionals. That’s definitely one of our team goals.\" \nThe Sectional 56 winner will travel to the Sectional 55 champion for a regional final on Oct. 27. The regional champion will advance to the Caston semistate on Oct. 31. \nJesus Jimenez contributed to this story.
