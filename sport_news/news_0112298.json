(Gary Hershorn/Associated Press) \nThe word “must-win” is often overused. Yes, this is a very hypocritical way to start a blog, but I digress. There’s really no other way to put the dire state of the Redskins right now. \nThe Redskins must win on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Bucs. They have to leave FedEx Field at 3-4 somehow, someway or this season will get ugly. \nIf the Redskins’ schedule was split up into quarters, this stretch against the Falcons, Jets, Bucs and Patriots will likely be the toughest four-game span this season. During the first quarter of the season, Washington finished at .500 with wins against the Rams and Eagles and losses to the Giants and Dolphins. It could’ve been better with a win against Miami, and it could’ve been worse with a loss to the Eagles, but the team did its job to start the year at 2-2. \nDuring the second quarter, if Washington somehow remains around .500 through the first half of the season, it will likely remain competitive down the stretch. That task will become very difficult to accomplish after the Redskins failed to snag a win on the road against the Falcons and Jets. Their best opportunity occurred in Atlanta when the Redskins failed to make plays down the stretch in the 25-19 overtime loss. Even though it’s one game, 3-3 would look significantly better right now than 2-4. \nThat’s not the case, however. Following the Bucs game, the Redskins have a bye week then travel to face the Patriots, who have lost just four times at home during the regular season since 2010. Good luck trying to win that one. \nSo it’s clear to see why Redskins Coach Jay Gruden declared “Code Red” after losing to the Jets. This will not be a pretty season if Tampa Bay somehow snags a road win. Washington would be 2-5 heading into the bye week, staring at a 2-6 situation with eight games remaining. The season could just as easily spiral downhill from there with more questions mounting on Gruden and quarterback Kirk Cousins with each passing week. \nWith a win, Washington would likely finish the first half of the season at 3-5 if you include a loss to the Patriots. That isn’t an ideal record to have, but the Redskins would still have plenty to play for in that scenario. The NFC East is awful this year and there doesn’t appear to be a team that will run away with the division. Despite consecutive losses, Washington is still just a game behind first place with the Eagles and Giants tied at 3-3. \nThe Redskins could still make some noise down the stretch, although the odds aren’t pretty. Washington has four division games during the second half of the season, including its final two games on the road against the Eagles and Cowboys. \nAnything could happen at that point in the division, but it all starts, or ends, with how the Redskins play against the Bucs. \nAll in a day’s work \nHere’s what you might’ve missed on The Insider: Here’s your weekly mailbag from Mike Jones, who answered your questions on Gruden and Cousins. Washington signed running back Mack Brown to the practice squad. \nThe opposing perspective \nTampa Bay could be receiving some reinforcements following a much needed bye week . \nUseful stat \nThe Redskins offensive line has allowed just seven sacks this season, tied for the third fewest in the NFL. Washington hasn’t held opponents to seven or fewer sacks after the first six games since 1996 (seven). \nUseless stat \nThe Redskins have won the last two games played in Week 7 over the last two seasons. They beat the Titans at home, 19-17, last season and defeated the Bears, 45-41, at FedEx Field two years ago. \nBucs writer to follow \nI’m a fan of Greg Auman, who covers the team for the Tampa Bay Times. He has a lively Twitter account that is Bucs-centric, but he also does a nice job mixing in his personality and other noteworthy subjects around the league. So only 11 of 32 NFL teams are above .500 today — Bucs are 2-3, but just one game out of 2nd wild card in NFC, where 9 teams have 2 wins. \n— Greg Auman (@gregauman) October 19, 2015 \n#ClapBack \nI’m also a fan of players responding to criticism on Twitter. Look, if you call out a player on social media, most responses are fair game (other than of course threats and anything else down that path). Social media shouldn’t be a one-way street as many have tried to make it over the years. Embrace the #ClapBack. \nThe latest comes from nose tackle Terrance Knighton, who responded to a blogger that indirectly criticized his play. Good thing ur not my boss… Blog on https://t.co/rfJBoUa4g6 \n— Terrance Knighton (@MisterRoast98) October 20, 2015 No disrespect? This is my life. My career. Everyone has a right to there own opinion tho.

There have been quite a few videos dubbing a different song over his (for better or worse) dance moves, which can be found here . Cornerback Will Blackmon uploaded one on his Instragram account using a track from Aventura that Drake re-posted on his own account. \nToday’s schedule \nThe team returns to practice this morning with Gruden and Cousins scheduled to hit the podium this afternoon. The Redskins media will also speak with Bucs Coach Lovie Smith and rookie quarterback Jameis Winston on conference calls. sports Success! Check your inbox for details.
