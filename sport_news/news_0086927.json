King, a 6-foot-6 utility guy who can play multiple positions, is already in the fold after his June commitment. He is a physical, athletic player who can help Louisville as an inside-out scorer, solid rebounder and rangy defender.\nHis AAU and high school coaches have both said in recent days that King is still solid in his commitment to Louisville despite recent allegations against U of L in a recent book that have prompted internal and NCAA investigations.\nAnd now Louisville has added another commitment into the mix in 6-4 guard Frankie Hughes, a lanky shooting guard from the Cleveland suburbs.\nThe next step for Louisville is finding a lead guard.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nThe Big Board: Louisville basketball's top 2016 recruiting targets\nAs of now, only Quentin Snider and Donovan Mitchell are expected to return as impact guards for that season, with David Levitch as a solid backup and the incoming Hughes and freshman Ryan McMahon serving as wild cards. Of that group, Snider is the only true point guard, though the others can help with ball handling.\nAs a result, Louisville has targeted two lead guards in the 2016 class -- five-star De'Aaron Fox and four-star Andrew Jones. Another guard, Australian Dejan Vasiljevic, has also emerged on Louisville's radar. Five-star forward TJ Leaf is no longer considering U of L.\nFive-star power guard Rawle Alkins continues to list Louisville among the schools he is considering, and until he takes the Cards off his list, we will keep him on ours.\nIf a player is no longer listed on the board, that means either he or U of L has moved on.\nBelow, we've broken down the group by priority, with more information about visits, positions, shoe affiliations (AAU circuits), other schools, and more. The \"more\" links will take you to more in-depth stories about each individual player.\nSo, without further ado, here is Louisville basketball's 2016 recruiting big board -- the updated 3.0 version:\nTHE 2016 BIG BOARD\nALREADY COMMITTED\nV.J. KING\nPosition: Wing. Size: 6-6, 180. Scout.com national rank: 21. In-home visit: Sept. 17.\nKing is a strong, athletic player who was a standout during the Nike EYBL circuit over the past few months. He did just about everything for his D.C.-area team, Team Takeover. He will be counted on to do the same things at Louisville, though he'll have more talent around him. He is probably a better scorer than freshman Deng Adel, but Adel is bigger, stronger and a better defender. They will make for a very solid pair of small forwards in 2016.\nMore: Evan Daniels reviews V.J. King's AAU season\nFRANKIE HUGHES\nPosition: Off-guard. Size: 6-3, 170. Scout.com national rank: Unranked in top 100. Unofficial visit? Oct. 10.\nA new prospect on Louisville's radar, Pitino checked in on Hughes in early October and offered a scholarship a week later. He is a lanky scoring guard who averaged 7.9 points, 3.5 rebounds and three assists a game on the adidas AAU circuit and helped his high school team reach the Ohio state semifinals.\nMore: Hughes picks U of L despite scandal\nTOP TARGETS\nDE'AARON FOX\nPosition: Lead guard. Size: 6-4, 170. Scout.com national rank: 4. Has U of L offered? Yes. In-home visit? Sept. 11. Official visit? Sept. 25-27. Final list : Kansas, Kentucky, LSU. AAU team: Houston Hoops (Nike).\nThis is one of the more interesting recruiting chases in the country. Fox is the top guard in his class, an electric playmaker who can handle, score, create, defend and do just about everything you'd expect a five-star, top-five, tall guard to do. But he is not your typical one-and-done kid. People who know him best say he has been thorough in his research of schools and knows quite a bit about each coach who is recruiting him, and that he won't fall for the surface-level recruiting pitches. He has taken a measured approach to the process and, despite the recruiting industry's hints to the contrary, insists he does not have any favorites as of now. Kansas and Kentucky are Louisville's main competition for Fox, with UK standing as the favorite.\nMore: U of L 'still in the running' for Fox\nANDREW JONES\nPosition: Lead guard. Size: 6-4, 175. Scout.com national rank: 30. Has U of L offered? Yes. In-home visit? Sept. 11. Official visit? Oct. 2-4. Final list (updated): Arizona, Baylor, Louisville, SMU, Texas. AAU team: Pro Skills (Nike).\nLike Fox, Jones is a tall, creative guard who is athletic and can make plays on both ends of the floor. His rapid rise up the national recruiting rankings -- he went from unranked to three spots away from a five-star rating on Scout -- illustrates how good he has become. The ongoing theory is that it will be hard to pluck Jones from Texas, mainly because his sister plays for Baylor and his dad, David, is paralyzed and living in Irving. But that theory conflicts with what Jones's dad and Jones himself have said. The younger Jones wrote in a short, autobiographical Q&A that location has no impact on his decision, and his dad has said several times that he sees no reason why distance would factor into his son's college choice. Louisville is a very real contender to sign him.\nMore: Jones's dad says allegations not a factor in son's decision\nMONITORING\nDEJAN VASILJEVIC\nPosition: Scoring guard. Size: 6-2, 195. Also considering: LSU, Saint Mary's, others. AAU team: N/A.\nA standout shooting guard from Australia, Vasiljevic is reportedly on Louisville's radar, according to Cardinal Authority. He's a 6-2 scorer, who averaged 13.3 points a game at the U19 World Championships this summer. That's the tournament where Chinanu Onuaku and Team USA took home gold. Vasiljevic shot 37.9 percent from the field at the event and 28.9 percent from 3-point range. He plays in Melbourne, Australia, the city both Deng Adel and Mangok Mathiang call home.\nRAWLE ALKINS\nPosition: Do-it-all perimeter player. Size: 6-4, 200. Scout.com national rank: 20. Has U of L offered? Yes. Also considering: Kansas, Kentucky, UNC, Indiana, St. John's, NC State and UNLV. AAU team: NY Rens (adidas).\nA physical, confident wing, Alkins is at his best with the ball in his hands, creating off the dribble. He goes right at defenders and looks to create. He plans to decide in the spring and has said he wants to visit every school on his list, which includes Louisville.\nMore: Alkins lists U of L in final 8", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a4e30f72c36a2bf0570da0b4d8c68285adcbc96/c=0-398-3883-2592&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/06/29/Louisville/Louisville/635712120916662430-court.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:03:55.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
