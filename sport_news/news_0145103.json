The company would have sold it sooner if not for the explosion, he said.\nKloza said the oil giant has had an adversarial relationship with California regulators and he expects greater harmony with PBF owning the plant.\n\"I really do believe this is good for PBF and Exxon Mobil, and it's good for California consumers,\" Kloza said. \"Having Exxon Mobil operate a refinery in a state that has declared they want to minimize fossil fuels was ... a bad marriage.\"\nThe refinery on 750 acres produces 1.8 billion gallons of gasoline a year, which accounts for about 8.3 percent of the state's total refining capacity.\nThe sale also includes other storage facilities and pipelines, including a 116-mile section that delivers San Joaquin Valley crude to the refinery and pipes that provide access to the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.\nExxon Mobil said 700 employees and 700 contractors work at the refinery. PBF said employees will be offered jobs at the plant.\nPBF, based in Parsippany, New Jersey, recently bought another Exxon refinery in Louisiana.\nWith the Torrance purchase, it will be capable of processing 900,000 barrels of oil daily.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
