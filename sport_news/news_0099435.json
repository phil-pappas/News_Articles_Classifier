That was very sad. \n\"But he is still, and always will be, a fantastic player. \n\"He's the best in the world, and the best compliment I could pass him is that every time I was playing with him, I was never really occupied with my opposite number. \n\"It was more a question of trying to match the player alongside me and try to perform the same as he was. I knew that if I did, I'd be in a good place. \n\"He'll be sorely missed but he's still a great mate so we'll see him again soon.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:04:18.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
