Andrew Mollenbeck, WTOP \nDownload audio \nLOS ANGELES — In Southern California, he’s called the “Soundtrack of Summer,” in part because most people have never lived a summer without Vin Scully behind the microphone. \nFor the last 66 years, Scully has been the voice of the Dodgers, first in Brooklyn and then in Los Angeles. But the team will have to carry on without its cherished announcer this postseason. \nSully, who will be 88 in November, was hospitalized Thursday and told by doctors to stay home during the playoffs in order to rest. \nWTOP spoke with the legend recently about his long career. \nHis baritone voice and welcoming, congenial delivery has become familiar across the country. Sully has called 25 World Series, National Football League games, golf tournaments (including the Masters) and even some tennis. \nHis storied career earned him a spot in the broadcast side of baseball’s Hall of Fame — 33 years ago. \nUnexpectedly, to him anyway, that unparalleled career began with an offer to work at WTOP. \n“I was shocked because it was actually the one station I was not going to send a letter to,” Scully told WTOP before a recent game at Dodger Stadium. \n“I said, ‘WTOP, no, that’s 50,000 watts,'” he recalls. \n“It’ll only cost you another 3-cent stamp,” the lady typing his letters told him. \nLong shot as it may have seemed to the then-college student, he heard back from the station, with a request that he show up in person. \nHe went in to audition, and a couple days later he was offered a job. \nScully started at WTOP in May of 1949, a month before he would finish school at Fordham University in New York. \nHe had to miss some work to go back to take his exams. \n“By the time I took the exams, I owed the staff a ton of hours, and there were many a day where I’d open at 5 a.m. and close at 1 a.m.,” he said. \nHe was a pinch hitter of sorts at WTOP, filling shifts for various full-time staff on vacation. In his own words: Working at WTOP Vin Scully \nDownload audio \nThe one job he never got was covering for the two men who were the presidential announcers. As Scully remembers it, one was always at the ready to introduce the president. \nLike so many young, poor Washingtonians after him, Scully caught a break at an hors d’oeuvres party. \nAt the time, he lived in an “animal house,” sleeping on a couch in a heavy coat. But shortly after arriving, he went to a British Embassy party. \nWhile there, he met a woman who was headed back across the pond to marry a man in the Royal Air Force. \nShe was looking for a house sitter. \n“I said, ‘Oh my gosh, yeah!'” he recalls. ”‘I don’t know anybody, so there won’t be any parties.’” In his own words: Living in Georgetown Vin Scully", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:09:41.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
