There was a big party called Woodstock. Richard Nixon became president. Jennifer Aniston was born.\nAnd in the waning days of baseball season, Chicago Cubs fans wept. They had been sure their team was going to the World Series; the New York Mets went instead.\nAs the Cubs and Mets meet over the next few days to determine which team will go to the 2015 World Series, I've once again enlisted venerable espn.com sports analyst Lester Munson to illuminate history for fair-weather fans and those too young to remember.\nHere's our conversation, slightly edited.\nQ. 1969. What does that evoke for a longtime Cubs fan?\nA. The 1969 season is the most tragic of all Cub seasons. This was a team with four Hall of Fame players, with the best lineup in all of baseball, the best lineup perhaps in the history of the Cubs, and the season ended in tragedy.\nCubs aren't dwelling on 1969 \"catastrophe\" Mark Gonzales Many Chicago Cubs players didn’t know of the lore of the black cat that darted onto the on-deck circle at Shea Stadium during the midst of the franchise’s September collapse in 1969 to the New York Mets.\nIn fact, rookie third baseman Kris Bryant has a black cat named Wrigley at his Las Vegas home.\n... Many Chicago Cubs players didn’t know of the lore of the black cat that darted onto the on-deck circle at Shea Stadium during the midst of the franchise’s September collapse in 1969 to the New York Mets.\nIn fact, rookie third baseman Kris Bryant has a black cat named Wrigley at his Las Vegas home.\n... (Mark Gonzales) Q. Take us back to Chicago in 1969.\nA. The setting in which this tragic team played included Richard J. Daley as mayor, Mike Royko as the supreme columnist. And it was the twilight of the career of the greatest Cub of them all, Ernie Banks. Added to the mix was the first celebrity manager in the history of the Chicago Cubs, Leo Durocher, a Hollywood personality and a great baseball man, who contributed to the tragedy.\nQ. What does Hollywood personality mean?\nA. Durocher hung around with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and other Hollywood celebrities. He enjoyed walking into restaurants and having everyone turn and look to see the great Leo Durocher.\nHe became involved in a romance with Lynne Walker Goldblatt, a tangential part of the famous Chicago department store family. The romance contributed to the tragic season when Leo and Lynne went to Wisconsin during the season to visit her son at camp. Durocher abandoned the team for three days because he was trying to make an impression on his girlfriend.\nQ. Describe the atmosphere of 1969 Wrigley.\nA. There were no ads you could see in Wrigley Field. No Budweiser, no banks. The fans were an older group. It was less exuberant. All the games were played in daylight. There were no lights, so without the night games, without the young people in the bleachers, it was a different atmosphere. All of those bars weren't there. It was not the rollicking neighborhood it is now.\nThe 1969 Cubs Ex-Cubs Ernie Banks, Glenn Beckert and Ron Santo look back on the ill-fated 1969 Chicago Cubs team, which led the NL East for most of the year, only to lose out to the New York Mets.

See more videos Q. So back to the tragedy. The Cubs reigned supreme in the National League East through the summer of '69 and then ...\nA. They were in first place, headed for the World Series. Then, in the final several games in the season, the team completely fell apart. In the lingo of baseball, they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.\nQ. Their losses to the Mets were key to their collapse, right? What happened at those games?\nA. Durocher had played his star players to a point of exhaustion. They put a guy named Don Young in center field. He dropped an easy fly ball. Ron Santo, the ad hoc captain of the team, exploded in rage, attacked his own teammate, Don Young, and from that point forward the team deteriorated.\nQ. There's also the story of the black cat that crossed Santo's path at Shea Stadium in New York.\nA. The black cat was a metaphor more than a cause. But it made for a great photo on the sports page.\nQ. What did the Cubs losses do to Chicago's mood?\nA. There was this incredulity and growing rage over the fact that it was the Cubs themselves who were causing the problem. It wasn't a better team beating them. The Cubs were the agents of their own destruction.\nMets' Matt Harvey on facing Cubs in NLCS: 'We're ready for them' Paul Sullivan The Dodgers and Mets played Game 5 of their National League Division Series Thursday night at Dodger Stadium because of some crazy Major League Baseball rule that prevents the Cubs from getting a bye into the World Series.\nThough everyone knows by now the Cubs' World Series appearance seemingly...\nThe Dodgers and Mets played Game 5 of their National League Division Series Thursday night at Dodger Stadium because of some crazy Major League Baseball rule that prevents the Cubs from getting a bye into the World Series.\nThough everyone knows by now the Cubs' World Series appearance seemingly...\n(Paul Sullivan) Q. Which Cubs team is better — today's or the 1969 team?\nA. The '69 team had four Hall of Fame players. Ernie Banks, Billy Williams, Ferguson Jenkins are in the top 10 players in the history of the Chicago Cubs. The players this year are younger, but they have a chance to become as good as the Hall of Fame players on the '69 team.\nQ. How is this manager, Joe Maddon, different from Leo Durocher?\nA. Leo was, and Joe Maddon is, a tactician of imagination and insight. The difference is Leo Durocher played his favorite players, he did not use his bench, he played the great players to exhaustion. And he had absolutely no skills for motivation or inspiration. He was this fearsome presence sitting in the dugout and glaring at everybody.\nMaddon treats all the players with respect. He gets everybody into the game. He is a master of motivation.\nQ. Older fans carry the '69 loss around in a way younger ones simply can't, right? You can't really feel what you didn't live.\nA. The number of people who went through the '69 season is smaller and smaller, but it lingers on with me and lots of Cub fans my age. I'm 74 years old. I can remember vividly.\nI went to a lot of Cub games with my father and he loved to talk about the teams of the 1930s. There was a player named Gabby Hartnett, and I enjoyed listening to him describe those teams, but Gabby Hartnett was not part of my reality. I'm sure that's true for younger people now.\nQ. What should we look for in the Cubs vs. Mets games?\nA. The first thing to watch for is the Mets pitchers. They have a group of young pitchers who throw the ball as hard as any group of pitchers in all of baseball. These are pitchers who can overpower most hitters.\nThe Mets have built their team around young pitchers. The Cubs have built their team around young hitters. So it's a perfect match of power pitching vs. talented, young power hitters.\nQ. Who's going to the World Series?\nA. Most baseball people would agree that good pitching will defeat good hitting. But it was Yogi Berra who said good pitching beats good hitting, and vice versa. We're hoping for vice versa.\nmschmich@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MarySchmich\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets World Series Joe Maddon Ernie Banks Mary Schmich", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621935d/turbine/ct-cubs-arent-wrapped-up-in-history-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621b682/turbine/ct-cubs-mets-mary-schmich-1018-met-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562081a4/turbine/ct-cubs-nlcs-nlds-sullivan-spt-1016-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-533b7c56/turbine/chi-the-1969-cubs-20140401"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:32:00.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
