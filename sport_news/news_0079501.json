Mike Nugent tied it with a 31-yard field goal on the final play of regulation. \nNugent was good again from 42 yards with 3:36 left in overtime, the ball deflecting off the left upright before going through. It matched the second-biggest comeback in Cincinnati's history when trailing in the fourth quarter. \nThe Bengals are 5-0 for the first time since 1988, the last time they went to the Super Bowl. \nSeattle (2-3) punted twice in overtime, giving the Bengals a chance to pull it out. \nOnline: AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:01:11.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
