TIDAL WAVE: Darien’s offense is a runaway train. In three games — convincing wins over Stamford, Greenwich and St. Joseph — the Blue Wave has scored 147 points and is showing no signs of slowing down. Quarterback Timmy Graham was the star of Saturday’s 49-7 thumping of the Cadets, throwing for 321 yards and two touchdowns in under three quarters. \n2. PRESIDENTIAL STATUS: Forget, even for a second, Harding's decision to leave the rough waters of the FCIAC for the kinder, gentler CSC. While detractors will point to the Presidents' 5-0 start as a byproduct of a softer schedule, it'd be foolish to ignore the program's sudden success. The Presidents displayed signs in 2014 of breaking out, and now they're reaping the rewards. Sophomore quarterback Taisun Phommachanh , who passed for one touchdown in a 40-35 victory over Abbott Tech/Immaculate on Friday, is the real deal. \n3. MONDAY NIGHT LIGHTS : Will you be craving for football on Monday night but have no interest in watching the underachieving Chargers host the Steelers ? If that’s the case, Shelton at West Haven could be the game for you. Inclement weather forced the big SCC tilt to be pushed back to Monday at 6 p.m. at Ken Strong Stadium. \n4. TWO-STAR SHOW: With help from Nicholas Dellapiano and Joe Capodagli, Masuk got back to the basics in a 39-35 victory over New Milford on Friday. Dellapiano ran for two touchdowns and passed for three scores, all to Capodagli, to stay alive in the SWC race and erase the stink of a 41-13 loss to New Fairfield. It was exactly the effort they needed. \n5. SWC'S FINEST: More than a month into the regular season, no one's come even remotely close to challenging Newtown. The three-time defending SWC champions are — yep, you guessed it — 4-0 and have outscored opponents 171-21. Sure, Brookfield was missing a pair of impact starters, Bobby Drysdale and Andrew Collins , for the Nighthawks' 42-14 rout on Sept. 25, but it might not have mattered. The Nighthawks will host Bunnell on Monday at 7 p.m. \n6. CHARGING AHEAD: Will anyone from the NVL beat Ansonia this year? The best bet appears to be Torrington, which moved to 5-0 after a 34-7 victory over Oxford on Thursday and hosts Ansonia in Week 7. The Chargers’ last NVL loss came in 2010 on Thanksgiving, 38-20, against Naugatuck. \n7. FRANCHUK FANTASTIC: Fairfield Prep running back Nick Franchuk ran for a whopping 278 yards and two touchdowns on just 18 carries in a 30-13 win over Cheshire on Friday. After a rough start to the season, the Jesuits are back to .500 at 2-2. \n8. DEVILS DEALT A DEFEAT : Stratford came up empty in its first big test of the season, falling 33-14 at Brookfield on Friday. The Red Devils shouldn’t fret, however, as their 4-0 start allowed them a little room for error down the stretch. Said coach TJ Cavaliere following the loss: “I wanted to see how we would play in a big game and big environment, and now we have to regroup and come out after the bye week ready for the second half.” \n9. DERBY GETS A LIFT : If ever there was a time for Ricky Bartone to put on his cape and deliver a Superman-like effort, it was Thursday against Naugatuck. With Derby at 2-2 and reeling after back-to-back blowout losses, Bartone, a star running back, came to the rescue with a monster effort in a 46-32 victory: 247 rushing yards on 42 carries, 66 receiving yards, four touchdowns. Wow. \n10. TAKING A SEAT: Only eight of the FCIAC's 17 schools played this weekend. A few teams, including 3-0 New Canaan, were off for the second time in just five weeks. Isn't the point of playing football to, you know, actually play? \ndbonjour@ctpost.com; @DougBonjour", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:19:08.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
