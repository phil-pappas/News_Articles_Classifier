Steve Jones/The C-J James Ramsey 116 CONNECT 52 TWEET LINKEDIN 7 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nUniversity of Louisville President James Ramsey said Wednesday that he has not talked with Rick Pitino about the possibility of the coach resigning over allegations that a former basketball staffer hired escorts to dance for and have sex with players and recruits in the team dormitory. \nAfter a meeting of the U of L Athletics Association's board of directors, Ramsey was asked about calls for Pitino to resign and if he's discussed that with the coach. \"I don't know who's made those calls,\" Ramsey said, \"but if they want to call me, they can do that.\" Tom Jurich: No plans for Rick Pitino to step down as Louisville basketball coach \nRamsey, who spoke to reporters for less than two minutes, said he had not watched ESPN's \"Outside The Lines\" report in which Katina Powell, an escort who alleges in a book that she and other women were paid by former U of L staffer Andre McGee, spoke on camera for the first time. That report also cited five unnamed former Louisville players or recruits who described some details of stripper parties similar to those alleged in Powell's book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen.\" \n\"I didn't watch it. I didn't see it,\" Ramsey said. \"There's an investigation taking place, and we're letting it play out, and I think that's the fair thing to do. \n\"The investigation is taking place right now, and it is moving forward as a joint investigation of the university. It's representative Chuck Smrt, who we hired, and the NCAA, and it'll play out in a fair way and a way to find what the real truth is and what the real answers are. That's what we want, and that's what we expect.\" Ex-U of L recruit: 'Like I was in a strip club' \nU of L athletic director Tom Jurich said Tuesday that Pitino has no plans to resign. \n\"He has no plans to step down,\" Jurich said through a spokesman. \"He has a long-term contract. He absolutely did not know anything about these allegations.\" \nPitino has said that resigning would be \"cowardly\" and on Tuesday called for McGee to speak out about the allegations. McGee, through lawyer Scott C. Cox, acknowledged that he knows Powell but says that he did not pay for anyone to have sex with escorts. \nJunior Bridgeman, an athletics board member and former U of L basketball player, said he's taking a patient approach to the investigations SEC coaches: Pitino can't be all-seeing \n\"I heard a long time ago that there are always three sides to every story,\" Bridgeman said. \"There's this side, that side, and then there's always the truth, so we kind of wait to see what that ends up being. ... I don't think anything other than that really deserves any reaction until we find out what the truth is, and then I think the authorities will make the proper decision based on that.\" \nBridgeman said the athletics board has not discussed the NCAA investigation, and he doesn't expect Jurich to offer the board updates on how it's going. \nAsked if he believes Powell's claims, Bridgeman said, \"It's not a matter of if I believe it or not because really I have no influence one way or another on the story. Everybody has an opinion, and I understand that. But in the scheme of things, my opinion, like a lot of other people's opinion, doesn't matter at all.\" \nSteve Jones can be reached at (502) 582-7176 and swjones1@courier-journal.com. 116 CONNECT 52 TWEET LINKEDIN 7 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1RWwXqJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:42:15.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
