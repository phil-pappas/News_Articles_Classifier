The Heisman Trophy candidate just wants to play football.\nUpcoming Games Utah Football Utah football stats & schedule ASU @ Utah Rice-Eccles Stadium, Salt Lake City Oct. 17, 8:00 p.m. 2 Days 17 Hrs 40 Mins 24 Secs “ He's hard-working. He's blue collar. He goes about his business. I don't think he enjoys the fanfare. He would just as soon just be able to do his thing without any attention being drawn to him.”\nUtah head coach Kyle Whittingham\nSALT LAKE CITY — Utah running back Devontae Booker is all business. The senior doesn’t care much for the spotlight. He just wants to play football.\nAfter rushing for a season-high 222 yards and two touchdowns in Saturday’s 30-24 win over California, Booker acknowledged he didn’t care much for the hype surrounding the game. He said the same thing after the season-opening victory over Michigan.\n“I just want to play,” Booker explained as the fourth-ranked Utes prepare for Saturday’s home game against Arizona State. “I could really care less about all the hype on any game.”\nThe Heisman Trophy candidate then shifted his remarks to the team and noted the importance of taking things one game at a time in order to continue climbing up the ladder.\n“He’s a humble kid. He’s all about just playing football and not worrying about the outside stuff that’s going on,” said Utah coach Kyle Whittingham. “He’s one of our team leaders and does a great job of setting the pace for us.”\nBooker, by his own admission, leads by example. Although he’s getting used to being more vocal as a team captain, the leadership role is something he enjoys. It’s not really anything new for him, especially the leading-by-example aspect.\n“He’s hard-working. He’s blue collar. He goes about his business,” Whittingham said. “I don’t think he enjoys the fanfare. He would just as soon just be able to do his thing without any attention being drawn to him.”\nBooker’s numbers, though, speak otherwise. He just became the 13th player in Utah history to eclipse 2,000 yards in career rushing and is on pace to break John White’s single-season school record of 1,519 yards — a mark Booker fell seven yards short of equaling in 2014.\nThrough five games this year, Booker has 665 yards on 140 carries with six touchdowns.\n“He’s a back that you love as an offensive lineman. He can do it all and he doesn’t shy away from contact — or is not scared when he gets hit big because the dude was probably feeling it when he hit him, you know,” said starting right tackle J.J. Dielman. “All you can do is make holes for him and help him back up after he dashes them for 20. So he’s a boss, man, and we’re lucky to have him. We really are.”\nDielman added that Booker is a guy that you can continually feed the ball to and is going to produce. He’s averaging 4.8 yards per carry on the season and 6.5 against Cal.\n“He’s a huge weapon and he’s definitely a great, huge impact player on our team,” said quarterback Travis Wilson. “I think that game was just the start of what’s to come. I think he’s just getting started with his good games. I see games like those coming a lot more in the future.”\nWhittingham has similar thoughts about it being a bit of a breakout game for Booker.\n“It sure was — not that he hasn’t been effective prior to this because he has,” Whittingham said. “Every week he’s made a huge impact, but this week is really the game that put him at that next level.”\nBooker doesn’t have much to say about that, though. Not much at all.\n“I don’t really care if it was a breakout game for me. I was just doing my job to help my team win,” he said. “But I think of every game that I do play as just a breakout game for me, period. I just go out there and do what I’ve got to do and that’s about it.”", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:20:25.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
