The team’s task is to assess whether the prestigious institution could start functioning from a temporary campus from the next academic session. The institute was earlier scheduled to start its academic functions from August. Sources said before visiting the old university campus on the evening of October 5, the team went to Jagti on the outskirts of the city to check the site for the establishment of a permanent IIT campus. At old university campus, the team inspected all the buildings and existing infrastructure on the campus, sources said. The team was accompanied by Additional Deputy Commissioner, Jammu, and senior officials of the PWD, PHE, PDD and the Higher Education Department. Sources said before returning to New Delhi on October 6, the team again went to Jagti and had a thorough inspection of the proposed site for the institute and its surroundings. “There is immense pressure on the state government to start the academic session from the temporary campus in 2016,” a source said. “A final decision, however, is yet to be taken by the visiting team on the start of the academic session from the old university campus,” the source said. Principal, Government Gandhi Memorial Science College, and Nodal Principal Ajeet Angral told The Tribune, “Yes, the team inspected the site at Jagti.” Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh had recently reviewed the status of the ongoing process for setting up of a temporary IIT campus in Jammu. He had issued directions to officials concerned to expedite the process for making the IIT functional from the next session.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:18:03.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
