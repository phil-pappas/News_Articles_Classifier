Belleville Althoff, the host, won the tournament with a 323 to edge Centralia by one stroke. Marion was third at 359, followed by Mt. Vernon (388) and Carbondale (391). Althoff's Matt McCarthy was the individual medalist at 73, with Lewis alone in second at 77. The top 10 golfers to earn all-conference medals all shot 84 or below. \"I played well other than two double bogeys,\" Lewis said. \"It was really windy and Stonewolf is a really tough course.\" Lewis shot a 74 at the South Seven Preview tournament to open the season, but under \"much easier\" conditions. \"The wind was swirling all day and it made it hard to hit straight shots,\" Lewis said. \"At Stonewolf you have to hit it straight orelse you can get in a lot of trouble.\" Also in the team score for Marion were Will Barwick (90), Dennis Johnson (93) and J.R. Lewis (98). Also playing were Andrew Parker (100) and Braden White (104). Marion finishes the regular season Saturday at the Mascoutah Invitational.
