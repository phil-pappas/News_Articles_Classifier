As U-M coach Jim Harbaugh said today, the discussions were in Maryland's court . The Terrapins certainly were not willing to give up an expected sellout. \nMaryland athletic director Kevin Anderson released a statement, as well: \"Our foremost priority is the safety and well-being of both teams, fans attending the game and staff. Our collective decision in working with the University of Michigan and the Big Ten Conference was to kick off as early as possible because of the unpredictable nature of Hurricane Joaquin. In addition, those participating, working and attending the game would not have to travel in the evening in potentially dangerous conditions.‚Äù \nNow there will be two games on the BTN at noon: Michigan vs. Maryland and Minnesota vs. Northwestern. Fans can go to btn.com/gamefinder to see which game is on which channel in their area. \nThe shuffle also is changing the kickoff time for Nebraska at Illinois, which now will kick off at 4:02 p.m. Eastern time, instead of 3:30 p.m. \nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
