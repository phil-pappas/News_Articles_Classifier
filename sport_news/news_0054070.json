Slimmed-down Lowry scores 26, Raptors beat Clippers 1 / 6 Back to Gallery VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Kyle Lowry scored 26 points in 21 minutes, leading the Toronto Raptors to a 93-73 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday night in a preseason game. The All-Star point guard, who arrived at training camp noticeably slimmer after a summer of healthy eating and grueling workouts, shot 7 for 10 from the field and 11 for 12 from the free throw line. JJ Redick led the Clippers with 15 points, while Blake Griffin — who knocked the shot clock off its mooring with a thunderous dunk during warmups — added 14. CLIPPERS: Paul Pierce made his only shot and scored two points in 9 minutes off the bench. He was booed after leading the Washington Wizards to a sweep of the Raptors in last season's playoffs. RAPTORS: Jonas Valanciunas, fresh off a strong EuroBasket performance in helping Lithuania earn an Olympic berth, had 10 points and 12 rebounds. Luis Scola scored 13 points and DeMar DeRozan finished with 11. NEWCOMERS: Offseason acquisitions DeMarre Carroll , Bismack Biyombo, Scola, and Canadian Cory Joseph all had solid debuts for the Raptors. BACK IN VANCOUVER: The game drew a capacity crowd of 19,000 that included former Vancouver Grizzlies guard Mike Bibby . The Grizzlies played in Vancouver for six seasons before moving to Memphis. \"It's an amazing city,\" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \"Without saying too much, I miss Vancouver. It's just a great city, it really is. It's vibrant, it's just nice. Deserves a team, along with Seattle.\" UP NEXT: The Clippers open a two-game series against Charlotte in China next Sunday. The Raptors play the Golden State Warriors in San Jose, California on Monday.
