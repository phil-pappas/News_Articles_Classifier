Marie Evening News - Sault Ste. Marie, MI By Phil Wenzel Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 10:29 AM By Phil Wenzelpwenzel@sooeveningnews.com Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 10:29 AM SAULTSTE. MARIEâ€” The Lake Superior State University athletic department hopes to start a new tradition next Thursday with the introduction of Laker Madness. The event is designed to draw attention to the LSSU Laker men's basketball team through. According to assistant coach Weston Strayer, it's modeled after the Midnight Madness practices held by other universities, like Michigan State. \"With the traditional Midnight Madness theme in mind, we will hold a night of activities and prizes to hopefully inspire some students and local fans to support Laker basketball,\" Strayer said in an e-mail. Laker Madness is sponsored by Bay Mills Resort and Casino and will begin in the Bud Cooper Memorial Gymnasium on campus at 7 p.m. A barbecue for attendees will begin one hour earlier. The schedule includes introductions at 7, followed by a 3-point contest amongst the players around 7:10. At 7:20, the players will participate in a dunk contest featuring celebrity judges and at 7:30 there will be a spot shot competition. Four students will be selected to battle the winners at the end of the spot shot event. After that, organizers have planned a 20 minute blue vs. white scrimmage game. The game will have a 20-minute running clock with regulation play for the last two minutes. Some fan games will be sprinkled in between, including shot-for-cash competition. The evening wraps up with a major fan contest in which someone will have a chance to hit a half-court shot for a major prize. The participant must be 18 years old and will be selected from a drawing. \"The night will be designed as a chance for fans to meet our players and see them in a setting outside traditional competition,\" Strayer said. He added that Laker Madness will be the team's only public event until Oct. 24, when it plays an exhibition against Lourdes College. By Phil Wenzel Sault Ste. Marie Evening News - Sault Ste.
