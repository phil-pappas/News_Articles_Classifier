Related Content 80-year-old pleads guilty to drug... University police from Rider University in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, responded to a report of students gathering at the school's track on Sept. 5 and found the team's runners about run laps in the nude, Rider spokesman Kristine Brown told NJ.com , according to The Associated Press. The officers put a stop to the plan and also found the students had alcohol at the track, the university said. The school then launched an investigation of all 28 members of the team. Although Brown told NJ.com the university found no coercion of any team members to take part in the run, Rider ruled the behavior unacceptable and considers it hazing. As a result, the team's coach Bob Hamer canceled practice until the investigation was complete and the team ultimately was banned from taking part in a Rider-hosted invitational meet on Sept. 19. \n\"Both the team's head coach and our director of athletics have met with the team to educate them on why their actions were inappropriate and reinforce Rider's student code of conduct,\" Brown told NJ.com.
