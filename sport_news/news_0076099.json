(Photo by Greg Macafee) Greg MacAfee Reporter FLAGSTAFF - The Mingus Marauder defense pitched their second shutout of the season and went on to defeat the Coconino Panthers 38-0 Friday night. The Marauder defense stepped up big early in the first quarter as it took the Marauder offense time to reach their top speed; once they did there was no stopping them. As the first quarter came to an end, Alec Phyfer made an open field tackle on a half back screen that forced the Panthers to punt for the second time of the game. On the next drive, Jordan Upham was sacked on 2nd down to force a 3rd and 19. Alec Phyfer came up big for the Marauders when he broke off a 20-yard run, shaking off multiple Coconino defenders to keep the Marauder drive going. On the very next play, Upham faked a hand off up the middle and scampered into the end zone from eight yards out to put the first six points on the board. After both teams received another chance to put more points on the board, Mingus punter Trey Meyer pinned the Panthers on their own 17-yard line. The Panthers marched down the field behind the arm and legs of their mobile quarterback Cristo Taberas. At the 3:51 mark, Taberas picked up 17-yards on a quarterback keeper and it looked like the Panthers were doing to put six on the board, until Taberas decided to pick on the wrong defensive back. Taberas threw up a fade pass to receiver Josh Harmon and Mingus defensive back Anthony Accurso was all over it. Accurso picked off the pass and the Marauders were back in business on their own 13-yard line. Upham and Phyfer both picked up first downs for the Marauders before Upham answered the call for the Marauders once again. With 18-seconds left in the first half, Upham broke another run between his tackles and shook two Coconino players with a nifty move and ran 71-yards for another Marauder touchdown. After a Trey Meyer PAT, the Marauders took a 14-0 lead and never looked back. The Marauders received the opening kickoff in the second half, and it didn't take long for them to find the end zone again. Upham broke off a 20-yard run, and then found Carson Anderson on a 24-yard pass that put the Marauders on the five-yard line. Upham found the end zone again, running it in from 5-yards out. Trey Meyer tacked on another extra point, just 2-minutes and 30-seconds into the second half, the Marauders were up 21-0. The Marauders forced the Panthers to punt on their next drive, after the ball was touched dead it only took the high powered Mingus offense one play to score again. Upham found classmate Tristan Clark for a 58-yard touchdown pass. Even though Upham only completed three passes, he threw for 101 yards on seven attempts. Head Coach Bob Young was happy to see his passing game succeed as the season nears its end. \"We had time to throw, all season we have had guys open we just haven't had time to throw,\" Young said. \"Its nice to see because moving forward we would love to throw the ball when we can.\" At the 3:23 mark, Coconino attempted to put their first points on the board with a 42-yard field goal but it soared left and the Marauders took over. With 52-seconds left in the third quarter, Trey Meyer tacked on a 43-yard field goal and the Marauders took a 31-0 lead. Mingus scored their last touchdown on a 70-yard run by senior Pete Kelly, after he broke through the Coconino defensive line. It was one of Kelly's two carries on the night and he took advantage of the opportunity. Kelly who is primarily a defensive player, was a force to be reckoned with, forcing the quarterback out of the pocket all night. It was his brother Tyler who came up with the only sack for the Marauders, bringing Taberas down for a 9-yard loss. Tyler Kelly also recovered a fumble for the strong Marauder defense. The stifling Marauder defense earned their second shutout of the season and Young was happy with their performance. \"They just played they played well tonight, in the first half I think we gave up a few too many yards to Taberas,\" Young said. \"But I think we made some good adjustments at halftime and tightened it up a little bit and they played strong in the second half. The Marauders finished with 433 total yards behind 249 total yards from Jordan Upham who gained 148 yards on the ground and 101 through the air. Alec Phyfer added 47 yards on the ground for the Marauders, and Trey Meyer added 23. As the season comes to an end with three weeks left, the Marauders are ranked at #10 in the AIA Division III rankings and will continue to rise after another victory, their third straight after losing to Peoria. Mingus takes on McClintock on the road next week, kickoff is set for 7 p.m.-- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee and Instagram @VerdeValleyNews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:34:56.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
