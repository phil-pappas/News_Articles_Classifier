The Cougars ranked second in the nation with 84.6 points per game in 2014-15, but also rated 318th in opponents' points per games, allowing 73.6. \nA new crew of post players, including UNLV transfer Jamal Aytes, hopes to change that mindset. \n\"I think it is new. I think a lot of people have their main dudes, but we can all do a lot of work in the post,\" Aytes said Tuesday during BYU media day. \"We can all get a bucket, defend and rebound. When you have that, it gives you depth, and when you have depth, it gives you more confidence. It makes us a stronger team going forward.\" \nAustin, a power forward who often played center in BYU's small-ball lineups of the past, brings crucial experience to the post as a fifth-year medical redshirt senior after his senior season ended in 10 games with a leg injury. \nBut he'll be joined by plenty of bodies in the post. The Cougars' 17-man roster has seven post players, including true centers Corbin Kaufusi and 7-foot-2 walk-on Alan Hamson, who averaged six blocks per game as a senior at Pleasant Grove High before serving a two-year mission for the LDS Church in California.

The toughness on this team is amazing now.\" \nThe Cougars will still score points. Collinsworth has 1,140 career points, just one point behind Mel Hutchins for 35th all-time at BYU. The sharpshooting Fischer owns the second most treys in a season with 103 in 2014-15, the most 3-pointers since Jimmer Fredette notched 124 in 2010-11. \nBut now the Cougars will also emphasize getting stops on the defensive end. Much of that mental enhancement comes from new assistant coach Quincy Lewis, who traded in one of the most successful Utah high school basketball coaching careers at Lone Peak for the chance to join Rose's staff this spring. \n\"He's definitely brought a defensive mindset,\" Fischer said of Lewis, who won seven Class 5A state championships at Lone Peak. \"I think we really wanted to make that a point of emphasis this year and improve on that. \n\"We always want to be high-scoring; that's just the system we run. But if we can hold teams to a couple more stops, it will show with a lot more wins. We really worked on team defense and always staying in plays, just buying in. Coach Lewis has been great for that.\" Related Story Media day offers glimpse of 2015-16 BYU hoops squad It was the first in-person look at the 2015-16 BYU men's basketball team at media day Tuesday. Only five players who appeared in game action from last year's squad will be options for BYU head coach Dave Rose this year. BYU will try to replace Tyler Haws, the school's all-time leading scorer. \nLewis, who will run the team's defense with input from fellow assistant Tim LaComb, will try to bring the same defense-first mindset that many of his Knights squads exhibited in the 5A ranks. \n\"He's changed roles, but he's still his same fierce self and he wants us to be better,\" said Nick Emery, one of Lewis' star pupils who won three state championships at Lone Peak. \"That's what he wanted for us at Lone Peak: to be competitive. He's brought that here to BYU, and that's what we're going to continue to do.\" \nBYU's next task will be jelling the newcomers with the veterans and implementing Lewis' defensive sets into game action. But the versatility and depth in the 2015-16 Cougars could lead to substantial improvements from the past season. \n\"I think a lot of the new guys bring us some versatility and depth,\" Aytes said. \"Kyle Davis is big there. Corbin Kaufusi has also made strides in his game. Jakob Hartsock can shoot the three; he's lights out and can do it all. \n\"When you put all that together on the team, I think our upside is real high.\" \nStill, first things first, cautions Rose. \n\"I'm looking forward to Monday,\" the 11th-year BYU head coach said. \"That's the start and we'll just go day to day from there.\" Photos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:31:43.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
