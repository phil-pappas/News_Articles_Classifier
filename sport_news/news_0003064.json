Tri-West blasts Lebanon 37-14 By Jim Belser CNHI Reporter.net \nWith identical records, similar styles, and near identical offensive numbers, Lebanon and Tri-West met to hash things out last night, and one team found away to click and produce a lob-sided win for itself. \nHost Tri-West (3-3) put together a string of big plays to put up 34 points in the first half, and eventually prevail for a 37-14 Homecoming win over Lebanon. \nMost of Tri-West’s success had a lot to do with senior running back Wes Cook. \nCook   first half, two on runs of 6 and 24 yards, and another on pass play that looked like it was going nowhere, but turned into a 47-yard scamper to the end zone. \n“Wes had a really good game tonight, we are really happy with his performance. His use of the vertical, and his explosiveness and the way he hits the seams helps,” Tri-West coach Chris Coll said. \nLebanon’s defense chased Tri-West quarterback Jake Hill out of the pocket, and running to his left, Hill got rid of it to Cook who tipped the too high pass with one hand to himself then scored, making it 34-7 Tri-West. \nThe Tigers struck first, however, and quickly. On fourth and 10 in the games' first possession, Tri-West was called for roughing the kicker on the Tigers punt. Lebanon retained possession and three plays later quarterback Evan Stambaugh found Clayton Barber for a 65-yard touchdown pass. \nWith Tri-West leading 21-7, Lebanon took possession at 6:30 in the second quarter and began to move the ball on the ground. Sophomore Jaylen Washington had four carries for over 50 yards in the possession and positioned his team at the Tri-West 16-yard line. On third-and-5 Stambaugh passed to Barber in the corner of the end zone, but Tri-West’s Jonny Broshears intercepted it, and ended Lebanon’s most promising stretch in the game. \n  Reporter.
