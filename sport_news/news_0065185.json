In an instant classic, Roanoke Catholic held on to defeat Richmond Christian 30-23 in a back-and-forth tug-a-war that wasn't decided until the last few minutes. Roanoke Catholic took a 8-7 lead with 4:24 to go in the second quarter then spent the rest of the game holding off the Warriors who are playing their 1st year of varsity football. Jamel Tyree displayed his lightning speed scoring on a 40-yard touchdown run where he just ran away from the Richmond Christian defenders. He added the 2-point run to give the Celtics a lead they never surrendered. The Celtics added a touchdown just before the half after a late hit out of bounds on a punt return gave the great field position at the Richmond Christian 31-yard line. Christopher Zoller muscled his way down to the 2-yard line on a 20-yard run then powered in from 2-yards out for the touchdown. He followed the score with a 2-point run for a 16-7 lead with under a minute to go before halftime. A preview of what would become an exciting 3rd quarter occurred on the first play when sophomore Jeremiah Carter returned the opening kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown to pull Richmond Christian to within 16-15 after the 2-point pass from Joshua Chisolm to Malike Mars. It was the last time Carter would receive a chance to return a kick. Roanoke Catholic answered quickly with a touchdown pass from Jeremiah Krajnik on a 3rd-and-10 for a 45-yard touchdown completion that extended the lead to 24-15 after the 2-point run by Zoller with 9:10 to go in the 3rd quarter. Senior Aaron Monts returned to score his second touchdown to again slice the lead to 1-point (24-23). Richmond Christian appeared to be in great position to take the lead after a bad snapped gave the Warriors the ball at the Roanoke Catholic 17-yard line. However, Roanoke Catholic intercepted a pass at the 2-yard line ending the threat. Clinging to a 1-point lead, the Celtics seemed to have a little more gas in the tank to put the game away. Zoller used some good downfield blocking while finding just enough running space for a 43-yard touchdown run with just under six minutes left in the game. He finished with 81 yards in the 4th quarter alone. The Warriors only lead came on their 1st series when Monts ended an 18-play, 74-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown run on the 1st play of the 2nd quarter. Monts converted three 4th down runs including the touchdown. He finished the 1st half with 101 rushing yards on 17 carries but a foot injury severely limited his production in the second half. The game featured plenty of highlights including one-handed catches, breakaway touchdown runs, a kickoff return, fumbles and interceptions. A rematch in the State playoffs would be a must see event.
