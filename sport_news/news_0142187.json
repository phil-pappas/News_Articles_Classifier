Valentine was a captain last year as well for the Spartans, and this is the first time for Nairn and Costello.\n\"They all got a lot of votes, but 'Zel got every vote on the team, and I only say that because he should be the main man as far as the guy that's got to lead and play,\" Izzo said today of Valentine before the first practice of the season for the Spartans, as they seek a return to the Final Four. \"That goes with pressure, but that goes with a rank, and they gave him the rank.\"\nAs for Nairn, Izzo said: \"I think that just speaks volumes of what kind of kid he is. Not even what kind of player he is. I just think he's an infectious kid. He's infectious in how he works. It’s still 6:30 every morning. You would think that it’d wear off. Austin Thornton goes, ‘I just can’t believe those two guys (Valentine and Nairn) come in every morning.’ They voted because they appreciate that and they realize that he’s infectious and that’s what a captain should be, one that drags others with him.”\nThornton and Thomas Kelley, both former MSU players, are graduate assistants with the team this season.\nPower forward questions : MSU sophomore forward Marvin Clark Jr. is out after having surgery on his left foot, and it could cause him to miss the Nov. 13 season opener against Florida Atlantic. Even if he’s back by then, Clark will need some time to get his wind back.\nFreshman Deyonta Davis will take aim at starting at power forward, but MSU also can go with Costello and Gavin Schilling together some this season, and Javon Bess will get some work at power forward as well.\n“We’re starting to see Javon Bess starting to play better and better,” Izzo said. “We’re playing him at (small forward), we’ve played him at (power forward) some, so he’s a little smaller. Our centers have all gotten better. It’s whether we can play those two bigs together some because we’re gonna have to some early. I think the positive out of the negative is (Davis) and Gavin and Matt are gonna get more work together … by necessity just because of the injuries. And that might help us in the long run.”\nHouse guest : Former MSU center Derrick Nix was on a flight back to Poland as Izzo spoke today, returning to play there professionally. But the Detroiter spent the past couple weeks in East Lansing, living at the Izzo household.\nIzzo said Nix has lost 17 pounds – that he “doesn’t look great” but is improving. And he said Nix seems to have a better appreciation now for the difference between college and the real world.\n“He has been through some ups and downs, as he always does, and it was interesting to just sit down with him at nights at my house and just talk to him about those kinds of things,” Izzo said of Nix, who graduated in 2013. “What I really realized is that we do a really poor job of really explaining what a scholarship is like and what you get in college. There are so many things that people don’t know about like medical expenses and this and that.”\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. @joerexrode .
