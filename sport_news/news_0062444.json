It’s unclear if Travis had a setback, but he didn’t play against the Cornhuskers. The Gophers have a bye this week before playing Michigan on Oct. 31.\nTravis ranked fifth on the team last season with 61 tackles and has yet to use a redshirt. If he’s unable to return this year, the Florida native would be eligible for a medical redshirt because the injury happened so early in the season.\n“We’ll know a little bit more here in the off week, kind of where he’s at,” Kill said on the Big Ten teleconference. “Where he’s at, and where we’re at in the season, [a medical redshirt] very well could happen.”\nThe Gophers got All-Big Ten cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun back from his knee injury last week. He had missed the previous two games. Gophers\nBye week • Up next: Oct. 31 vs. Michigan\nThey also got two defensive linemen back from unspecified injuries, Scott Ekpe and Gaelin Elmore, but lost defensive end Alex Keith because of a broken hand during warmups.\nMiddle linebacker Cody Poock, who ranks second on the team with 45 tackles, missed the Nebraska game because of an unspecified injury. Starting outside linebacker De’Vondre Campbell (34 tackles) played but was limited because of an unspecified injury.\nKill said Sunday on WCCO (830-AM) that he didn’t expect to get offensive linemen Josh Campion and Brian Bobek back from their unspecified injuries.\nThe Gophers will hold light practices Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week with the primary goal of getting healthier.\n“I don’t think the mood’s bad,” Kill said during the teleconference. “They were disappointed after the [Nebraska] game. There’s a lot of football to be played, and we’re just like everybody else.\n“There’s a lot of people that need some bodies back, and we just need some guys, certainly on the offensive line and in the secondary and linebacker. We’ve got to get some guys healthy, which hopefully this off week, we can.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:45:38.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
