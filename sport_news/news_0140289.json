The Wildcats lost 36-34. By Ken Corbitt ken.corbitt@cjonline.com \nSTILLWATER, Okla. — An error in the placement of the down-marker chains gave Oklahoma State a five-yard advantage during a late second-quarter touchdown drive, helping the No. 20 Cowboys to a 36-34 victory over Kansas State on Saturday. \nOklahoma State was flagged for a holding penalty on first-and-10 from the KSU 45-yard line, wiping out a 41-yard pass play from Mason Rudolph to Jhajuan Seales. The 10-yard penalty should have made it first-and-20 from the OSU 45, but the first-down marker was moved back only five yards to indicate first-and-15. \nThe officiating crew didn’t catch the mistake, nor did the K-State coaching staff. \nRudolph was sacked on the next play by Marquel Bryant for a 7-yard loss, but instead of second-and-27 the Cowboys faced second-and-22. Rudolph completed a 4-yard pass, and on third-and-18 he found Marcell Ateman for a 19-yard gain and a first down at the KSU 39. \nThe drive continued and the Cowboys scored a touchdown on an 11-yard pass from Rudolph to Ateman with 46 seconds left in the second quarter, drawing OSU within 28-20 at halftime. \nK-State coach Bill Snyder was at a loss to explain the snafu at his postgame press conference. \n“I was trying to think what the official told me and I can’t tell you that I remember right now,” Snyder said. \nThe Big 12 issued a statement Sunday afternoon acknowledging the error. \n“Accurracy (sic) and adherence to Conference policies and officiating mechanics are vital to the proper administration of the rules in all games,” Big 12 supervisor of officials Walt Anderson said in the statement. “Disciplinary actions will be addressed with both the field officials and chain crew.” \nTWO TAKEAWAYS — Linebacker Will Davis came up with his first career interception and the first by a Wildcat this season, a pick early in the fourth quarter that the offense wasn’t able to convert into a crucial score. \nOn second-and-6 from the KSU 21, Rudolph got a pass to Seales, but cornerback Danzel McDaniel got a hand on the ball and as Seales went down Davis out-wrestled him to gain control. \n“I think Danzel got his hand in the way enough to where the receiver bobbled it,” Davis said. “I saw it dropping and I just came in and kind of swooped underneath it and caught it.” \nThe K-State offense drove to the OSU 29, but an intentional grounding penalty on Glenn Gronkowski on a fullback option pass and a 14-yard sack of quarterback Joe Hubener took the Wildcats out of field goal range, preventing them from adding to their 28-26 lead. \nThe Cowboys scored a touchdown on their next drive, benefitting from the first-down marker misplacement. K-State regained the lead on Hubener’s 5-yard touchdown run with 3:01 to play, up only 34-33 after a failed two-point conversion pass attempt, then OSU drove down for Ben Grogan’s game-winning 37-yard field goal with 32 seconds remaining. \nDavis’ interception was the second takeaway of the game for the Wildcat defense, which had only one in the first three games. Jordan Willis deflected a backwards pass in the second quarter that McDaniel recovered to set up Justin Silmon’s 6-yard touchdown run. \n“We were able to create a couple of turnovers and that was big for us,” Davis said. “There were also times in the game when we should have been able to create more turnovers and capitalize on some things they did, and we didn’t do that. We still have to improve in that area. \n“The interception was good, but I wish it would have been on the next drive. Any time you can get a turnover it’s a big momentum swing, and there were a lot of momentum swings in this game. We were opportunistic at times, but at the end of the day we still came away with a (loss). It doesn’t mean much to me.” \nCRE MOORE ARRESTED — Cre Moore, a backup defensive back, was arrested at 3:26 a.m. Sunday, according to the Riley County Police Department. \nThe RCPD daily arrest report did not list charges against Moore, who was picked up at 1919 Poyntz Ave., and confined overnight. No bond was set on the police report and RCPD indicated details would be discussed in a future press release. \nK-State officials said the matter will be handled internally. \nMoore, 20, is a sophomore from Broken Arrow, Okla. He had on tackle in the game Saturday at Oklahoma State. \nKen Corbitt can be reached at (785) 295-1123 or ken.corbitt@cjonline.com .Follow Ken on Twitter @KenCorbitt .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:53:09.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
