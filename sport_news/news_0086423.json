Their cases have been forwarded by investigators to the ethics committee’s adjudicatory chamber; in effect, the evidence against them has been presented to the committee’s judge, Hans-Joachim Eckert, for sentencing.\nThe committee did note that its probe of Jérôme Valcke was related to “the suspicion of misuse of expenses and other infringements.” Mr. Valcke, FIFA’s top administrator and Mr. Blatter’s top deputy, was relieved of his duties last month amid charges that he had profited from a black-market ticketing scheme. Like the others, he has denied wrongdoing.\nThe other names released Wednesday amount to a who’s who of past FIFA scandals: Jeffrey Webb, the former Concacaf president who was arrested at a Zurich hotel in May ; Eugenio Figueredo and Nicolás Leoz, who were included in United States indictments in May; Ricardo Teixeira, the former Brazilian soccer chief who quit FIFA in 2012 to head off an earlier corruption probe; Amos Adamu, a Nigerian who served a three-year ban from world soccer for soliciting a bribe in exchange for his vote in the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups; and Worawi Makudi, a Thai soccer official and former executive committee member who was provisionally suspended earlier this week .\nThe ethics committee was given new rights to discuss its activities by FIFA’s executive committee on Tuesday. Previously, it was barred from even confirming the existence of an investigation before a final ruling was announced.\nThe ethics committee said that it “will do everything in its power” to settle the cases of Mr. Blatter and Mr. Platini within the 90-day window of their provisional bans. Mr. Platini has said he will run in the election to choose Mr. Blatter’s successor next February, but he cannot be approved as a candidate while under suspension.\nMr. Villar’s case could be a new embarrassment for world soccer’s leadership. In addition to serving as Mr. Platini’s temporary replacement as the head of UEFA, Mr. Villar is currently the senior vice president — and second-ranking official — at FIFA while Mr. Blatter is banned.\nDuring an executive committee meeting in Zurich on Tuesday, Mr. Villar also was named Mr. Platini’s temporary replacement as the head of FIFA’s organizing committee for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. At that meeting, FIFA also approved the ethics committee changes that resulted in Wednesday’s announcement that Mr. Villar, too, could be facing a ban.", "external_links": ["http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/football-fifa-suspends/2187816.html", "http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/documents-indicate-slush-fund-used-in-german-world-cup-bid-a-1058212.html", "http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/12/fifa-ricardo-teixeira-resigns", "https://books.google.com/books?id=oFW6BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT163&lpg=PT163&dq=villar+llona+world+cup+bidding&source=bl&ots=5lVuZELLcB&sig=XxkuusiEMEsW_tYumcAtWnyNDPE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBmoVChMI0vGHzPPTyAIVzHo-Ch1jigs6#v=onepage&q=villar%20llona%20world%20cup%20bidding&f=false"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:55:43.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
