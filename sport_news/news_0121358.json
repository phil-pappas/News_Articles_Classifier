(Photo: Jordan Allred / The Spectrum & Daily News) CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSacramento State and Southern Utah enter Saturday’s contest (Eccles Coliseum, 6 p.m.) heading in opposite directions. \nThe T-Birds (3-2) are winners of three in a row, all in blowout fashion, while the Hornets (1-5) have dropped their last four. \nThat's not the only thing the two teams don't have in common. While Southern Utah used its bye week to heal from some minor bumps and bruises, because that’s all the T-Birds have really had to deal with, Sacramento State has been beat up. The Hornets will be starting their third different quarterback of the season against SUU because of injuries. \nWill the two teams stay on their current track on Saturday? \nSacramento State players to watch: \nJordan Robinson will be looking for his fifth straight 100 yard rushing game. He was injured in the Hornets' loss to Montana State, last week, but Sacramento State coach Jody Sears said Wednesday that he will play. \nPreseason All-American linebacker Darnell Sankey is second in the FCS in total tackles with 80. \nThree things to watch: \n1. SUU’s offense under Justin Walterscheid \nWalterscheid will be making his debut as offensive coordinator after Gary Crowton abruptly resigned early last week. The T-Birds haven't gone through an offensive overhaul, and will keep the same terminology and playbook — at least until the end of this season. \nThe new OC said he plans on just sharpening up what the T-Birds have been doing and getting his athletes in spots to make plays, and allow them to make him look good. \n“Something I want to a good at is making sure that we aren’t a one dimensional attack,” Walterscheid said. “We have multiple playmakers and we take advantage of those playmakers within our offense and make it harder for defenses.” \nHis goals for the players entering the game are pretty simple: Know your assignment and do your job. \n“If we all do our job, we are going to be great,” he said. \n2. Sacramento State QB woes \nThe Hornets haven’t caught many breaks at the quarterback position, this season. \nStarter Daniel Kniffin was injured against Eastern Washington and his backup Kolney Cassel went down last week against Montana State. That means Nate Kettingham is expected to make his first start of his young career on Saturday. \n“You can call it whatever you want,” Sacramento State Jody Sears said, “but this is football and things like this happen. You lose a quarterback or two, you lose a guy here, you lose a guy there. It’s next man up. You don’t abandon ship. You don’t whine and cry about what kind of luck you think may or may not have.” \nSears said that Kniffen is questionable for the contest, but is not expected to play. Freshman Alexis Robinson will serve as the team’s backup. \n3. SUU interceptions \nOne of the challenges for the young Sacramento State quarterback will be protecting the ball from the T-Birds, who have turned into ball hawks, as of late. \nIn the last three games, SUU has collected 11 interceptions, and have returned three of those for scores. \n“The way the coaches set us up, the ball just comes right to us,” corner Josh Thornton said. “All you gotta do is catch it. The guys we have (in the front seven), if you just do your assignment, those guys are going to be there, they’ll to tip a ball or something and you just have to make the play.” \nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter, @millerjryan.
