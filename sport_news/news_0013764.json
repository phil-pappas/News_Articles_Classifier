They'll have a little extra time for prepare for next week's conference game at Arkansas, but let's take a look back at their narrow victory over the Wildcats (4-2, 2-2). Louis speaks to Duke Williams before having career night \nSticking with Sean: Not only did Sean White stem off Jeremy Johnson during the bye week to keep his starting job, he further secured that spot with a sound performance. No turnovers, completed 17-of-27 passes for 255 yards and was only sacked once. Made a couple of questionable throws with one that should have been a Pick 6 for Kentucky and overthrew Tony Stevens in the end zone, but White should get the start next week. \nIs it time to start the clock on Jeremy Johnson's time at Auburn. Not yet. He's a bad White game away from seeing the field beyond lining up at wide receiver in a wildcat set for freshman Kerryon Johnson. \nShake 'em off: Freshman cornerback Carlton Davis' interception in the second quarter kept Kentucky from tying the game at 14-14 early in the second quarter, but his hustle late in the fourth quarter was big as well. Boom Williams caught a 7-yard pass on 2nd-and-10 to the Kentucky 22, but Davis was held on the play trying the make the tackle. He even gave a shoulder move to show he was held. Refs saw it and called holding to push Kentucky back to its 12. \nThe play made UK drive even longer to try to tie or win the game. Commentary: A few tweaks pay dividends for Auburn \nPass defense: Patrick Towles threw for 359 yards, but didn't throw a touchdown. That's crazy. Towles was intercepted once and sacked three times with the final by Justin Garrett to end Kentucky's final offensive drive with 25 seconds left. This kid has talent, but there were a few times he got greedy when Auburn was giving him the underneath. It's OK to take shots downfield, but there is a time and place for those. Towles picked the wrong time too many times. \n1-2 punch: Auburn has found its thunder and lightening at running back in sophomore Peyton Barber and freshman Kerryon Johnson. Barber has arguably been Auburn's best player this season as he rushed for 92 yards and two scores. Johnson went for just 36, but he had four kick offs for 111 yards and caught a pass for 14 yards. Those two have Roc Thomas and Jovon Robinson on the outside. Thomas started the game, but managed just eight yards on four carries and watched Barber finish it. \n4th-and-1: Gus Malzahn decided to punt instead of going for it on 4th-and-1 from the Auburn 47 with two minutes, 19 seconds left. I thought Auburn was going to punt it all along, but looking back on it, Malzahn put the game in the defense's hands. Not sure that was a good idea considering how the defense was playing, but it worked out. The real question is will this lead to the offensive-minded Malzahn turning to Will Muschamp's defense to win games?
