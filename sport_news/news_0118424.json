Beckham, the Giants' No. 1 wide receiver, is questionable with a hamstring injury.\nMatthews is the Eagles' top wide receiver, and he could see a favorable matchup in the slot with the Giants' 32d-ranked pass defense hampered by an injury to top cornerback Prince Amukamara. Coming off the best game of his career, Huff is expected to start in place of rookie Nelson Agholor, who is out with an ankle injury. \nBeckham's status will be revealed by the time the list of inactive players comes out 90 minutes before kickoff, and it will a major factor in the game. He makes the Giants' pass offense potent, and if he's absent, the Eagles' secondary would have an easier day. Beckham recorded the most yards of his career (185) in a Week 17 loss to the Eagles last year. He did not practice this week, but the Eagles prepared for Beckham to be on the field. \n\"Our approach is he's playing,\" Kelly said. \"We'll see [No.] 13 on Monday night. [He's] a very competitive player, know him very well. He's going to play against us.\" \nThere was a healthy respect for Beckham from the Eagles this week. Malcolm Jenkins remembered the way Beckham blocked after taking a big hit last season, and that impressed the Eagles' safety more than any highlight-reel catches. \nMatthews said that all that qualities that make Beckham popular originate from the same place. \"I think his best attribute is his swagger,\" he said. \"Just from being around him and being friends with him, the best thing he has is confidence. Any of the catches he makes, it comes from that.\" \nMatthews knows Beckham well. The two SEC-bred receivers trained together before the draft and remain in touch. Beckham first reached out to Matthews when Matthews played at Vanderbilt and Beckham played at LSU. Matthews asked Beckham for Cris Carter's contact information during the offseason so Matthews could hone position-specific skills. \nMatthews, who was drafted 30 picks after Beckham, finished his rookie season with 67 catches for 872 yards and eight touchdowns. He became the Eagles' top receiver this season after Jeremy Maclin departed in free agency, and he started the season on a scorching pace with 16 catches for 182 yards and one touchdown in the first two games. \nHis production slowed since those first two weeks, with 14 catches for 143 yards and no touchdowns in the last three weeks. The Eagles like to spread the ball around, but Matthews often presents a mismatch in the slot. That could be the case on Monday because the Giants are missing Amukamara and list cornerback Trumaine McBride as questionable. Matthews could see coverage from journeyman cornerback Trevin Wade. \nMatthews was sure-handed as a rookie, but he already has four drops this season, according to Pro Football Focus. He had five drops all of last season. The Eagles' have 17 drops in 2015, which is tied with the Giants for most in the NFL. \nKelly called the drops an area the Eagles must \"clean up,\" but he was encouraged that players such as Matthews and Agholor catch balls on the JUGS machine at 7 a.m. each day. Matthews called it part of his \"morning routine.\" \n\"I don't know if it makes you better, I just know it doesn't make you worse,\" Matthews said. \nWith Agholor sidelined, Huff could see an uptick in playing time. Huff set career highs last week with four catches for 78 yards and his first receiving touchdown in the NFL. He played 49 percent of the snaps. \nHuff was the 86th overall pick in the 2014 draft, and he has been outperformed early in his career by receivers drafted after him. Another strong performance would show what the Eagles saw in the third round. \nIn a draft class with perhaps the deepest pool of wide receiver talent in NFL history, the Eagles came away with Matthews and Huff and the Giants came away with Beckham. All three will be key figures on Monday - but the Eagles' receivers cannot worry about stacking up against Beckham. \n\"That's the last thing I think about,\" Matthews said. \"I'll let the defense worry about going against Odell. . . . I've got enough on my plate worrying about [the Giants]\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:07:49.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
