(Photo: Craig Rubadoux/FLORIDA TODAY) \nCocoa High moved up one spot in the rankings of Florida high school football teams compiled this week by the Associated Press. \nThe Tigers, fifth a week ago, moved to No. 4 with 75 points and two first-place votes. Unbeaten Jacksonville Raines (6-0) got the other 12 first-place votes and moved up to the top spot after its district rival Bolles suffered its first loss. The Bulldogs fell to No. 2. \nHeritage, whose only loss came to Bolles on Sept. 4, still has not returned to the Class 6A top 10 despite a regular-season win over the No. 9 team in 8A (Kissimmee Osceola) and a preseason win over a team, Vero Beach, tied for second in 8A. Both Panthers wins were on the road. \nHeritage received eight points, one behind the teams tied for ninth, Matanzas and Niceville. Armwood was the No. 1 team in the class. The Panthers host Sebastian River on Friday in a game that will determine the lead in District 14-6A. Week 8: Florida Today You Pick 'Em Survey \nCocoaâ€™s next game is Thursday at Orlando Jones. The Tigers can hold a share of the District 5-4A lead with Astronaut with a win. \nPalm Bay, coming off a 40-35 win at Viera, its fifth win in a row, received eight points in the 5A rankings, two behind No. 10 Nature Coast. Plantation American Heritage was at the top in 5A. \nThe rest of the No. 1 teams were Miami Columbus in 8A, Dwyer in 7A, Jacksonville Trinity Christian of 3A, Jacksonville University Christian in 2A and Fort Meade (1A). \nContact McCallum at 321-242-3698 or bmccallum@floridatoday.com.
