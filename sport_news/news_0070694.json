(Video via NFL )\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars play the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\nAnd it's streaming globally, exclusively and for free on Yahoo (and local TV, of course). Even though the NFL's most popular games have drawn 27 million viewers on TV nationally so far this year —\nthe league wants to make sure it's ahead of the technological curve.\nAnd bringing the game to international prominence is huge, too.\n\"I just like the sport and since the Jags are coming to the U.K., I thought they were a good team to pick,\" says a Jaguars fan with a very, very, very British accent.\nThe NFL in London has been a lucrative idea. Wembley Stadium's sold out for 12 out of the 13 NFL games it's hosted. (Video via Regent Street Association )\nAnd the Jaguars will be heading across the pond for at least the next five years — maybe even the next 15.\nKickoff is at 2:30 p.m. local time in London — great timing for fans in Europe and Asia.\nBut a bit early for U.S. viewers. That's 9:30 a.m. EST (and 6:30 a.m. PST).\nBut who says you have to get out of bed? All you need is a laptop or an OTT device. (Video via Yahoo )\nHow to watch: Yahoo.com, Yahoo mobile apps, Tumblr, Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, Amazon Fire, Xbox, Samsung, Vizio P series and TiVo.
