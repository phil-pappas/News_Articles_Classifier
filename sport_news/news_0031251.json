But Colorado State coach Mike Bobo said the toughest test of all is much closer to home.\nThe Rams themselves.\n\"I think it's us,\" Bobo said, his team 2-3 overall, 0-1 in conference play entering the game. \"We talked about it on Monday that we're our own worst enemy. We've got to handle ourselves. We've got to worry about the little things and correct what we can correct. We know Boise's good. We know they're good on offense. We know they're good on defense, good on special teams. We've got to become consistently good at all three phases, and that's what this week's been about, trying to get to that point.\"\nColorado State has yet to get there in any of the five games it has played. The Rams have won the turnover battle just once this season — against Texas-San Antonio — the one game in which they didn't turn over the ball. Boise State has feasted on teams making mistakes.\nAdvertisement But the mistakes go beyond that for Colorado State. CSU is among the most-penalized teams in the nation, in terms of flags thrown and yardage lost because of the infractions. Then there are the assignment busts on offense and defense.\nThose on defense are often more obvious and have led to quarterbacks in the past two games running wild against the CSU defense. Last week, Utah State had eight explosive runs (gains of 15 yards or more) in a 33-18 victory, running for 298 yards in all.\n\"It's all about us,\" linebacker Kevin Davis said. \"The couple of games we have lost have been little things or a couple of plays. If we eliminate those big plays, the big passes over the top and we play our runs and fits right, we'll have a good game.\"\nThe Rams, in spurts, have shown what is possible. They have held the lead in every game so far, but the issue has been being consistent with the play in all three phases, allowing three games to slip away from them, two resulting in overtime losses.\nThe running game that was so effective against Minnesota and Colorado was nonexistent last week, putting pressure on quarterback Nick Stevens. The fourth quarter against Utah State was one long passing down for the Rams, and the Aggies teed up the pass rush.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:11:45.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
