The Cougars run the air-raid offense and will pelt the Ducks' defense with upwards of 60 attempts through the air. It's excessive, but it's designed that way. Opponents expect the pass, generally can't defend the pass, and games against the Cougars are often high-scoring affairs.\nAnd right now, with Vernon Adams Jr. nursing a broken finger, and Jeff Lockie and Taylor Alie struggling to find consistency at quarterback, the Ducks could be morphing into a similar type of mold as the Cougars, just with their legs instead of their arms.\nAgainst Colorado, Oregon ran the ball 62 times — its highest total in two seasons. In the second half, with the passing game in a rut, the Ducks leaned heavily on Freeman, freshman Taj Griffin and redshirt sophomore Kani Benoit . All together, the Ducks combined for 361 yards on the ground and three touchdowns. By comparison, Lockie and Alie combined to throw for just 176 yards and two scores.\nCampbell said he's getting his backs ready for a similar type of usage going forward, specifically Freeman, who had eclipsed the 25-carry plateau only once in his career prior to Colorado.\n\"I think he proved that he can do that ... 25, 26 carries with him I think is feasible,\" Campbell said. \"We got three other backs that I think can carry it, too. If need be for him to carry it that many times, I think he can handle it.\"\nCampbell pointed to some of the other elite backs around the country who routinely see carries in the high-20s and said Freeman (96 carries, 613 yards, 7 TDs) should be included with them. Though just a sophomore, Freeman is built like a truck and has that \"give me the ball\" attitude that a team would like to see in a bell cow, just like Ohio State's Ezekiel Elliott (100 carries, 729 yards, 8 TDs) and LSU's Leonard Fournette (99 carries, 864 yards, 11 TDs).\nThere is no controversy with the Ducks at the running position, though Griffin, Benoit and Tony Brooks-James are all fighting for Freeman's scraps. On Saturday, it was Griffin who made a name for himself. He used his 11 carries to churn up 110 yards and a touchdown, seemingly providing more lighting to Freeman's thunder. At 5-foot-10 and 175 pounds, Griffin has the size, and potentially the ability of past Ducks out of the backfield who used their speed and shiftiness in the open field to break out for big plays.\n\"I like what I've seen from his this season,\" Campbell said. \"The whole holdback for him has been the learning process, him really getting the offense down, lining up in the right spots and being able to protect the passer.\n\"He is getting better. He still has some glitches now and again, but as I said, he is improving in all areas.\"\nAnd with Griffin's emergence, it just further jams the rest of a backfield that, at the beginning of the season, seemed to be just Freeman, Benoit and Brooks-James. But with Oregon's future potentially resting on how well the Ducks run the ball from here on out, there are plenty of carries to go around. Freeman will get his 25 to 30, meaning there are potentially another 30 to be distributed amongst the others.\n\"When they tell us that they need us to step up and make some plays, you look forward to it,\" Benoit said. \"With the first back, second back, third back, there should be no drop off.\"\nOregon ranks eighth in the country with just more than 300 yards per game and 10th with a tick more than 50 carries per game. The Ducks rank 66th in the country in passing yards per game, at 227.4, a number that might or might not improve depending on how Alie, Lockie and Adams progress through the rest of the year.\nBut at least it seems like the running backs are doing their part to buy the Ducks a little time.\n\"Whenever you can run the ball,\" Oregon coach Mark Helfrich said, \"you can kind of do anything, so that is something we want to get going.\"\n-- Tyson Alger\ntalger@oregonian.com\n@tysonalger", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/tysonalger"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:04:57.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
