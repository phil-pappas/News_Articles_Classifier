The federal agency says Dakota Rural Action and South Dakota State University will receive funding to help programs that train and support beginning farmers and ranchers. Dakota Rural Action in Brookings has been awarded $225,000 to train 50 beginning farmers and ranchers in whole farm planning, business management, value added marketing and sustainable production methods. The funding is also meant to help 90 beginning producers access several local food marketing initiatives. SDSU will get nearly $707,000 to provide a training and mentoring program that assists beginning beef cattle producers. The program includes workshops on livestock production, marketing, finance and leadership. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved. Material may not be redistributed.
