(AP) - A 23-mile segment of the North Western State Trail in Michigan’s northern Lower Peninsula has reopened after a resurfacing project. \nThe state departments of Natural Resources and Transportation recently announced the update on the project between Alanson and Mackinaw City. \nThe biking, walking and running trail was closed in April. The segment runs through the communities of Brutus, Pellston, Levering and Carp Lake. \nThe trail also is undergoing construction on a separate project due for completion this fall to replace the bridge over the Maple River near Pellston. \nThe 32-mile North Western State Trail, located on the former Grand Rapids to Mackinaw Railroad, completes a regional trail network connecting Petoskey to Mackinaw City and then to Gaylord and Alpena. The trail is open to snowmobiles Dec. 1 to March 31. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:32:38.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
