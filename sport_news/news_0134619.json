Hendricks was reportedly rushed to the ER last night.\nWoodley was deservedly upset, given that he called his bout with Hendricks a \"mini title shot.\"\n\"I'm counting this as a loss for him,\" Woodley said of Hendricks to mmafighting.com . \"You got to make the weight. I'm sitting here at weight, wired, ready to wage war and now I'm not going to get that opportunity.\"\n@TWooodley: @UFC fans I apologize u will not get a chance 2 watch the highly anticipated Welterweight War! Going live on @periscopeco @periscopetv now!\nA photo posted by Tyron Woodley (@twooodley) on Oct 2, 2015 at 9:05am PDT\nAlmost immediately after Woodley posted on Instagram, it was announced that Woodley would get the next shot at the welterweight title after Robbie Lawler and Carlos Condit fight at UFC 195 in January.\n@UFCONFOX My next fight will be a title shot! I'm not fighting anybody in between! @UFC #UFC I deserve that and my win bonus\nâ” Tyron T-Wood Woodley (@TWooodley) October 2, 2015 For more on Hendricks' issues cutting weight, click here.\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TWooodley/status/649996112854585344", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/other-sports/moresportsheadlines/2015/10/02/johny-hendricks-reportedly-rushed-er-bad-weight-cut-dana-white-says-ufc-192", "https://instagram.com/p/8V13ADQOAa/", "https://twitter.com/UFCONFOX", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC?src=hash", "http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/2/9439841/johny-hendricks-forced-out-of-ufc-192-fight-after-being-rushed-to?_ga=1.136493241.82776480.1443816747", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/ufc"], "published": "2015-10-02T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:12:37.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
