But the Boston Book Festival is worth marking your spot and leaving your house for.\nThe festival kicks off with award-winning author Margaret Atwood’s keynote Friday night (which, unfortunately, is already sold out). The event continues with more than 40 sessions featuring more than 150 presenters all throughout Copley Square Saturday. There’s something for everyone: we rounded up some of the most intriguing (and free) sessions. Here’s what session to go to if...\n...You carry around your manuscript asking everyone for their opinion:\n“Writer Idol: Ann Collette, Sorche Fairbank, Amaryah Orenstein” : At this session, author and director of GrubStreet Boston, Christopher Castellani, will perform the first page of your unpublished manuscript. Three literary agents—Ann Collette, Sorche Fairbank, and Amaryah Orenstein, will listen attentively and raise their hands when they would have stopped reading. Harsh? Sure. But they’ll then impart some literary wisdom as to why they were turned off. And don’t worry — not directly at you. All excerpts are read and evaluated anonymously. (Old South Mary Norton, 645 Boylston Street, 10:30 a.m.)\n...You’ve been obsessed with the latest Star Wars trailer:\n“Star Wars and D&D Flights of Fancy or Serious Business?”: Indulge your inner fantasy nerd at this event that features Michael Witwer, author of Empire of Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons , and Chris Taylor, author of How Star Wars Conquered the Universe . Plus, you’ll have a chance to prove yourself as King or Queen of Star Wars /D&D knowledge in a trivia quiz after their talk. (First Church Sanctuary, 66 Marlborough Street, 11 a.m.)\nA scene from the 2015 film STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS. Film Frame (c) 2015 Lucasfilm ...You’ve religiously kept a diary:\n“But Enough About Me: Reimagining the Memoir”: Do you write down what you’ve done every day, just knowing that, one day, everyone will flock to bookstores to snag a copy of your life story? Well, take a break and listen to other people talk about their own tales. Three memoirists— The Odd Woman and the City ’s Vivian Gornick, The Folded Clock’ s Heidi Juliavits, and Hammer Head: The Making of a Carpenter ’s Nina MacLaughlin (a Massachusetts native)—will explore truth, memory, and how to best tell your story (so other people will actually be interested). (First Church Sanctuary, 66 Marlborough Street, 12:30 p.m.)\n...You waited in line for The Fault in Our Stars without shame:\n“BBF Unbound: Raising Each Other—Why YA is for Everyone”: If you’ve read every Young Adult novel you could get your grown hands on, don’t be embarrassed—these adults share your (overly-emotional, teenage-like) feelings. In this session, you’ll read, share, and ask questions about everything YA lit has to offer with three award-winning authors: Rachel DeWoskin, author of Blind and Big Girl Small ; Carolyn Mackler; author of The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things ; and Cindy Rodriguez, author of When Reason Breaks . (First Church Auditorium, 66 Marlborough Street, 12:30 p.m.)\n...You watch every Law and Order: SVU marathon:\n“It’s a Crime” featuring Deborah Halber, Stephen Kurkjian, and Ben Mezrich: Unlike SVU , all of these stories are completely true. Boston Globe columnist and reporter Sacha Pfeiffer (who will soon appear as a character in the movie Spotlight , portrayed by Rachel McAdams) will grill three nonfiction writers about their bizarre-but-true books. Ben Mezrich explored the dubious world of murder and wealth in Once Upon a Time in Russia: The Rise of the Oligarchs . Stephen Kurkjian spent 20 years investigating that infamous Gardner museum heist , and shared his thoughts on the culprits in Master Thieves: The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World’s Greatest Art Heist . Deborah Halber discovered the gruesome world of Internet sleuths who take it upon themselves to solve unidentified cases in The Skeleton Crew . (Boston Common Hancock, 40 Trinity Place, 12:45 p.m.)\nRachel McAdams and Sacha Pfeiffer during the filming of Spotlight. © Spotlight Film, LLC. ...You literally judge a book by its cover:\n“The Book as Creative Space: Massachusetts Book Artists on Their Art and Craft”: Let’s face it: A book’s looks matter. But how do you make a paper book stand out in the age of everything touch screen? At this panel, three internationally-collected Massachusetts book artists will share how they remain innovative and exciting when it comes to regular ol’ paperbacks. You’ll even get to peruse a small show of the artists’ work after the panel. (Trinity Forum, 206 Clarendon Street, 12:45 p.m.)\n...You play guitar for hours trying to create the perfect riff:\n“Hits, Hooks, and Jam Bands”: At this talk, moderated by WBUR’s On Point host, Tom Ashbrook, three writers dive into the dilemma of what makes a hit song. How do you unravel what made a pop song soar? Alan Light chose to examine the ‘80s song so great it spurred a movie in Let’s Go Crazy: Prince and the Making of Purple Rain . Walter Holland went the jam-band route to see what made hippies hop on the bandwagon in Phish’s A Live One . And John Seabrook tackled the entire music industry in his book The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory . See if you can snag some tips to write the next chart topper. (Old South Sanctuary, 645 Boylston Street, 2:15 p.m.)\n...You were the class clown who obsessed over Sunday comics:\n“Funny Papers: Chip Kidd, Bob Mankoff”: How would you react if we told you you could see never-before published art by Peanuts’ s creator Charles M. Schulz? If that sounds like a dream, you’ll love this event. New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff and “comics aficionado” and book jacket designer Chip Kidd are sure to leave you in stitches as they talk about cartoons. Mankoff’s book, How About Never—Is Never Good for You? , dissects just what it is that makes a cartoon funny, and Kidd explored the uber-popular appeal of Peanut s in Only What’s Necessary: Charles M. Schulz and the Art of Peanuts , and will share some of Schulz’s unpublished art. (Trinity Sanctuary, 206 Clarendon Street, 4 p.m.)\n...You’d proudly rep a Notorious R.B.G. shirt:\n“The Supremes: A Towering Giant and a Pint-Sized Powerhouse”: Are you a Ruth Bader Ginsburg enthusiast? Grab your R.B.G. bobblehead and come to this talk that will compare Ginsburg to Thurgood Marshall. Turns out the lawyers-turned-Supreme-Court-moguls have a lot in common. Shana Knizhnik, the brains behind the Notorious R.B.G. Tumblr , teamed up with journalist Irin Carmon to write all about Ginsburg in Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg . They’ll be on stage with Wil Haygood, representing Marshall (he wrote Showdown: Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court Nomination That Changed America , along with The Butler ). (First Church Sanctuary, 66 Marlborough Street, 4 p.m.)\nU.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg receiving her honorary degree at Harvard in 2011. The Boston Globe / Pat Greenhouse ...You’re a classic kind of Halloween fanatic:\n“Creatures and Creators”: What’s October without talk of vampires and Frankenstein?
