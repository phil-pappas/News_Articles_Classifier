It also ranks as the third of four primetime games on FOX to have an increase in ratings and viewership. \nThough a solid performance for FOX, Saturday’s game was still no match for the competition. It trailed Miami/Florida State on ABC (2.3, 3.5M) and Arkansas/Alabama on ESPN (2.9, 4.8M) head-to-head. \n(Sat. numbers via TV Media Insights ) Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:04:50.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
