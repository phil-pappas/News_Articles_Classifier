With Nike, Jordan has Tinker Hatfield — largely unknown by the general public, but a prized sidekick who has helped sell billions of dollars of shoes.\n“It’s a totally true collaboration,’’ Jordan told USA TODAY Sports. “He looks in my closets, he looks at my cars. He comes out with things I don’t agree with. ‘Tinker, I can’t even think about wearing things like that.’\n“We really, really challenge each other to kind of push the envelope a little bit when we need to and then take it back when we need to, too. He’s been a great complement to me. I’ve learned so much hanging out with Tinker.’’\nUSA TODAY\nError Jordan: Key figures still argue over who was responsible for Nike deal\nHatfield confirms that Jordan does a lot more than cash his Nike royalty checks, which are expected to reach $100 million this year. In fact, Hatfield said, the two recently met at Jordan’s home in Jupiter, Fla., with a second shoe designer and a videographer to go over the final details of the next Air Jordan, model No. 30 of the sneaker line launched in 1984.\n“We work conceptually and then we get into prototypes and then we go into the refinement process,’’ Hatfield said. “And only after the refinement process can we sit down and just check all the boxes and Michael says it’s awesome or whatever and then we’re off to the races.\n“It’s mind boggling to me even after all these years that Michael is still so interested in the process and the details and so willing to give us time. I think he actually enjoys talking about design. He enjoys contributing to design. And then of course he really, really loves the results.’’\nJordan said he would have it no other way.\n“The key to the whole process is I have as much input as I did the first day if not more now, if anything,’’ Jordan said. “Because I feel like whoever’s wearing the shoes may not have the understanding of the history and what it took, so I want to make sure everybody understands that. Because to me that’s very authentic.\n“If you lose that authenticity, then it’s tough for the consumer to accept. So we stay very authentic with everything we do, from the ads to the new product to all the things.’’\nHatfield said the process of creating a signature shoe calls for collaboration.\n“We’re trying to improve performance for a particular athlete, but we’re also trying to extract the DNA from that athlete and design it into the shoe,’’ he said. “So in order to do that, you’ve got to talk about personal things and take the time to learn and get to know the people.’’\nTheir collaboration began under anxious circumstances. Peter Moore, Nike’s lead creative designer, had just left for Adidas when Hatfield was assigned to the Air Jordan line. He’d spent the previous four years as Nike’s corporate architect.\nUSA TODAY\nWhat's bigger than Michael Jordan? Gotta be the shoes\nHaving heard Jordan was interested in design, Hatfield talked about his hope for a full collaboration, beyond what took place during the design of the first and second Air Jordans.\n“I haven’t been able to get rid of Tinker since,’’ Jordan quipped.\nFor Air Jordan 13, Hatfield created designs based on images of a predatory black cat, along the lines of a panther — what Hatfield said he imagined when watching Jordan play basketball. He showed Jordan the designs between a TV commercial shoot Jordan was doing in Los Angeles.\n“He stopped me in the middle of this presentation and he just looked at me and he goes, ‘How did you know?’ ” Hatfield recalled. “And I’m like, ‘How did I know what?’ He said, ‘How did you know that only my closest friends call me The Black Cat?’ ”\nIt was evidence they were in tune, and apparently still are even though Hatfield declined to reveal anything about Air Jordan 30 — other than he and Jordan collaborated.\n“It’s been a long and fun relationship,’’ Hatfield said, “and in some ways led to the innovation that has driven the market.’’\nPHOTOS: Nike Air Jordans through the years\nNike Air Jordan I, 1985.
