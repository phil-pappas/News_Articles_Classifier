(Alex Gallardo / Associated Press) Steve Dilbeck \nIf the news was uncomfortably vague, it was still bad news. \nThe Dodgers announced Thursday that Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully had undergone a recommended medical procedure and would not call any postseason games. \nScully, 87, had missed calling the final three regular-season games last weekend with what the Dodgers called a cold. \nThe Dodgers said he was resting comfortably, but released no further information on his procedure or its seriousness. \nThe Dodgers, however, did not say he would simply miss the National League division series against the Mets, but the entire postseason. \nScully, probably the most beloved figure in Los Angeles history, is still planning on returning next season for what he said will likely be his last. It would be his 67th consecutive year broadcasting Dodgers' games. \nA look at the life and career of longtime Dodgers announcer Vin Scully. \nThe Dodgers said Scully was resting comfortably after his procedure. \nMORE DODGERS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:27:35.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
