Glynn’s win over the fifth-ranked Gators (5-1, 3-1) coupled with Coffee’s victory over South Effingham on Friday, created a four-way tie atop the league standings between these same four teams who all now have a region loss. \nThe Terrors are off next week before finishing the season against Effingham, Statesboro and South Effingham. Ware still has to face Effingham, Statesboro, South Effingham and Brunswick. Coffee closes against Brunswick, Richmond Hill and Bradwell Institute and South Effingham plays Richmond Hill and Bradwell before finishing with Ware and Glynn. \nThe loss to Glynn ended a 34-game winning streak in region games for the Gators who had not lost a league counter since losing 22-14 at Brunswick in their 2010 region opener. Ware had also won 24 straight regular-season games since falling to Coffee in their 2013 season opener. \nThe Terrors led 3-0 at halftime on a 40-yard field goal by Banks Entwistle. \nEntwistle added a 48-yard field goal early in the third quarter for a 6-0 Glynn advantage after a Ware fumble on its first possession of the second half. \nThe Gators drove 79 yards in 15 plays to score on their next series, getting a 6-yard touchdown run by Gary Williams that gave them their first and only lead of the game following the extra point with 3:04 left in the third period. The Glynn defense committed five penalties on the drive that aided the Gators including three on third downs that gave Ware first-down yardage. \nGlynn answered Ware’s only score with an 11-play, 82-yard drive to regain a 12-6 lead with 9:27 remaining in the game. Kendall Cross capped the march with a 1-yard run before junior quarterback Deejay Dallas added the two-point conversion to give the Terrors their 14-7 advantage. \nOn the Glynn scoring drive, Cross carried for 41 yards in addition to the touchdown. \nFor the game, Glynn finished with 183 total yards. Dallas led Glynn with 68 yards rushing on 17 carries. He was 2-for-4 passing for 44 yards while making his third straight start at quarterback. \nDedrick Mills led Ware with just 36 yards on nine carries. Lincoln was 5 of 15 passing for 50 yards for the Gators.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:44:25.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
