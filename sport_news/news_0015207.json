The Scarlet Knights nearly came through before falling short, 31-24 .\nRutgers (3-3) will need to be even better to have a shot against No. 1 Ohio State on Saturday night at High Point Solutions Stadium (8 p.m., ABC). The 7-0 Buckeyes appear to be hitting their stride after a sluggish start to the season and the change to quarterback J.T. Barrett wasn't welcomed news for Rutgers fans who recall his 368-yard, five-touchdown performance in Ohio State's 56-17 win last season.\nHere are five things Rutgers needs to do win the game:\n1. Rutgers must run the ball\nA strong rushing attack is part of the formula to any Rutgers win. But the ground game will be particularly important against Ohio State.\nThe Buckeyes' run defense has been shaky, allowing 158.7 yards rushing per game, which ranks 60th nationally. And Ohio State will be without starting nose tackle Tommy Schutt on Saturday.\nEverything starts with the run game for the Scarlet Knights, who are averaging 199.2 yards per game on the ground (32nd nationally). The rotation of Paul James, Josh Hicks and Robert Martin can be maddening when a back with a hot hand has to sit for two series , but it's tough to argue with the results.\nAll three backs are averaging at least 5.4 yards per carry, with Martin leading the way at 6.2 yards per tote. James will continue to start and he appears to have rediscovered his pre-torn ACL explosiveness, as he is averaging 10.2 yards per carry in the past three games . Hicks has looked like the best back at times, but he needs to address his fumbling issues.\n2. Rutgers must have an effective Leonte Carroo\nIt's highly unlikely that Carroo will be 100 percent after he suffered an ankle injury last week that caused him to sit out the fourth quarter of the Indiana game and miss the first two practices of the week. Carroo is considered a game-time decision , but it's difficult to imagine the senior sitting out.\nThe question is how effective can Carroo be at less than 100 percent? Underestimate him at your own peril, as he had seven catches for 134 yards and three touchdowns against Michigan State after missing over three weeks of practice due to a suspension.\nBut Carroo was healthy when he returned from the suspension. This is a completely different situation, as it's difficult to imagine him having his typical level of explosiveness on a bad wheel.\nCarroo's presence alone will make a difference, but Rutgers is going to need a few big plays from the star receiver. Can he do that at less than 100 percent?\nRELATED: ESPN's Chris Fowler reflects on 2006 Louisville win\n3. Rutgers must slow Ohio State's pass rush\nRight tackle J.J. Denman has struggled in pass protection this season, so there's no chance Rutgers will leave him alone against Ohio State defensive end Joey Bosa, who Rutgers coach Kyle Flood called \"possibly the best player in college football.\"\nExpect the Knights to slide protections toward Bosa, chip him with running backs, keep tight ends in to help block and anything else possible to contain one of the most destructive players they'll face. The problem with focusing so much attention on Bosa is that he's joined by other talented players on the defensive line.\nOhio State ranks fifth nationally with 3.43 sacks per game, while Bosa ranks tied for fourth on the team with 2.5 sacks. On third downs recently, Bosa has moved inside alongside defensive tackle Adolphus Washington (three sacks) with Tyquan Lewis (5.5 sacks) and Sam Hubbard (3.5 sacks) bringing pressure off the edge.\nOhio State's dangerous pass rush is another reason that establishing the run is essential for Rutgers, as it will keep the Knights out of third-and-longs. This could also be a game where Janarion Grant gets more involved on quick passes to negate the pass rush.\n4. Rutgers must force Ohio State to throw the ball\nBarrett showed last season that he's a capable passer, but Rutgers is going to have to force Ohio State to throw the ball. This will be Barrett's first start of the season, but in spot duty in six games he has completed just 27-of-44 passes for 249 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions.\nIf Ohio State's offense has a weakness, it's been the wide receiver play. The Buckeyes haven't established a consistent deep threat yet, which was a key piece of their offense last season.\nThis may be a case of \"careful what you wish for\" because Rutgers ranks 124th nationally in pass defense and cornerback Blessuan Austin is questionable with an upper body injury . It wouldn't be a surprise if Ohio State's passing game comes to life against Rutgers' depleted secondary.\nBut that still doesn't change the game plan, because if the Scarlet Knights can't stop the run, they'll have no chance. Rutgers isn't going to win the battle at the line of scrimmage against Ohio State's offensive line, but it must be competitive. If Barrett and running back Ezekiel Elliott are getting to the second level cleanly, it'll be a long night.\n5. Rutgers must win the turnover battle\nRutgers was able to overcome a 25-point deficit against Indiana last week and hang tough against Michigan State in large part because it won the turnover battle in both games. Turnovers had been a major problem early in the season, but the Knights have a plus-3 margin in the past two games. They had a minus-7 turnover margin through the first four games.\nMeanwhile, Ohio State only has a plus-1 turnover margin this season. Rutgers is going to need to force some turnovers because it's highly unlikely its defense will be able to consistently stop the Buckeyes' attack.\nRutgers quarterback Chris Laviano has only one turnover in the past two games, but he's fumbled four times and made some ill-advised throws. He needs to clean that up or Ohio State will make him pay on Saturday.\nPenalties were also a major concern early in the season, but Rutgers has only been flagged four times for 30 yards in the past two games. That trend must continue against Ohio State.\nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21 .
