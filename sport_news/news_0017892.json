For the second time this season, the Owls came out flat after a play stoppage. \nThis time, a 90-minute lightning delay preceded them blowing a 12-point, fourth-quarter lead in a 27-26 loss to Rice on Saturday at FAU Stadium. The loss dropped the Owls to 1-4, 1-2 in Conference USA. \n\"I don't want to use it as an excuse, but certainly it's irregular,\" FAU coach Charlie Partridge said. \"We're getting used to the irregular around here. We've got to come out and handle it and come out with the same intensity and focus that we do. An hour and 20 minutes is a challenge, but there's no excuse.\" \nIt was just a few weeks ago the Owls were playing the Miami Hurricanes close before play was interrupted because of lightning. Just like that game, FAU faltered after the break. Rice scored on drives of 91 and 83 yards to steal a game in which it was dominated most of the second half. \n\"We didn't do our jobs,\" FAU quarterback Jaquez Johnson said. \"We had missed throws. I can say it was my fault. I didn't lead my team enough. We didn't move the ball.\" \nA 14-yard pass from Rice quarterback to running back Darik Dillard with 2 minutes, 7 seconds remaining served as the deciding points. Moments later, FAU's hopes of avoiding the meltdown ended when Johnson, who threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns, was sacked near midfield on a fourth-and-5. \nA first down would have at least given kicker Greg Joseph, who was 2 of 2, a chance at a winning attempt. \n\"We live down here [in South Florida].\" receiver Kamrin Solomon said. \"We get rain delays all the time at practice. That has nothing to do with it. That's not an excuse. We can't make that an excuse. We just didn't come together as a team.\" \nThe comeback occurred just as it appeared FAU had fixed all the issues that led to an 0-3 start. Apparently, a bye week was the exact remedy. FAU shook off a slow start, mainly on defense, to complete a strong third quarter, allowing just 8 yards. \nThe offense also got it together. The Owls, who had committed five turnovers in each of the past three games, finished without any giveaways and gained 391 total yards. The game also featured the longest play from scrimmage in school history. \nThe Owls trailed 14-7 when Solomon hauled in a 94-yard touchdown pass from Johnson. Solomon, a sophomore, caught the ball around the 40-yard line before outrunning defenders to the end zone. \nThe play is also tied for the longest in the nation this season. \nA pair of field goals by Joseph early in the third quarter gave FAU its first lead, and freshman running back Trey Rodriguez's 9-yard touchdown made it 26-14 with 13:50 remaining. \nBefore the Owls could attempt the extra point, the lightning arrived. Players headed to the locker room. Fans were asked exit the stadium. The 30-minute clock was reset four times because of lightning sightings, conjuring memories of the Miami game that was delayed 67 minutes. \n\"It was obviously a disappointing, heartbreaking loss,\" Partridge said. \"There were times where again it looked like we have a chance to be a good football team â€¦ We've got to finish drives. We've got to get a first down. We've got to get a stop. We do that and we're having different conversations right now.\" FAU blows fourth-quarter lead in 27-26 loss to Rice \nSunday, October 11 2015, 02:58 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:40:44.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
