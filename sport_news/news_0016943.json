The Maryland women's basketball team was unbeaten, a perfect 18-0, in the Big Ten Conference last season. It won the Big Ten tournament. It advanced to the Final Four, two rounds further than the Big Ten's next-best NCAA tournament team.\nAdChoices On Wednesday, after a vote by coaches and media, the Terps were named conference favorites, picked to repeat as champions. Even the coach of the second-ranked team voted Maryland No. 1. All of which raised two questions about the team's still-new place in the league, one obvious and one less so.\nFirst: Is another spotless season in the Big Ten possible? And does even the mention of such a possibility suggest that the Terps, two seasons after leaving the powerhouses of the Atlantic Coast Conference behind, need a rival, need someone to push them, for better and for worse?\n\"I think that's the biggest thing that probably needs to get established,\" Maryland coach Brenda Frese said at the league's media day Thursday.\nThe pickings were not so slim in the ACC. There was Duke, of course. There was North Carolina, another longtime blue blood. There was even Florida State, a Final Four participant in 2010.\nIn the Big Ten, the choices are not so clear. Ohio State finished second in preseason voting this year. It has the conference's most electric talent, sophomore Kelsey Mitchell. Five starters return.\nAnd yet: \"I voted [Maryland] first,\" Buckeyes coach Kevin McGuff said. \"I think they should be picked first based on what they did last year, the players they have returning. They also have a really exciting freshman class coming in, so I think they're the team to catch right now.\"\nPicking a rival is not as easy as picking a pair of shoes. Rivalries take years of good games (and maybe some showings of bad blood, too) to develop. One win over Maryland does not make the teams' next meeting must-see TV.\nIt would be a good start, though. The Terps' 18th-regular season conference game last season ended with their 18th conference win, a 69-48 victory over then-No. 25 Northwestern. Then they beat Michigan State, the Wildcats and Ohio State to win the tournament title in Hoffman Estates, Ill., the Buckeyes' three-point defeat marking the closest any league team got in 21 tries.\nHow do you stretch such a streak, Maryland players were asked. Pretend like it doesn't exist, they said.\n\"If you go at it with the mentality like, 'We're going to play the game,' that's how I like to look at it,\" said senior Brene Moseley, who's expected to step in at point guard after All-Big Ten selection Lexie Brown transferred to Duke in the offseason to be closer to her family. \"If I try to think about, 'Oh, I've got to keep this undefeated record going,' it's going to become bigger than what it is, and it's really nothing like that.\"\nThe mantra heard most often Thursday at the Maryland table in the Chicago Marriott O'Hare hotel is also the biggest kernel of hope for its competition: This is a new season, a new team.\nThe Terps return junior guard Shatori Walker-Kimbrough and junior center Brionna Jones (Aberdeen), both preseason All-Big Ten selections. They do not return Brown or guard Laurin Mincy, an all-conference player last season and the No. 27 pick in the WNBA draft.\nThe Terps have two All-American recruits in forwards Brianna Fraser and Kiah Gillespie. They also have two new assistant coaches, Bett Shelby and Terry Nooner, who have been in the program for just as many preseasons.\n\"I'm not going to lie: It's been quite the change,\" Frese said. \"But I've always embraced change.\"\nOnly once did Maryland celebrate its Big Ten hegemony last regular season, senior center Malina Howard said. It was after the win at Northwestern, after their league record showed 18-0. Having joined Ohio State (1984-85) and Purdue (1998-99) as the only teams to finish the conference's regular season undefeated, the Terps entered their Welsh-Ryan Arena locker room giddy and delirious. They decided to hide from their coaches, just because.\nWhen Frese and her staff came into view, Howard remembers jumping out and screaming and cheering. They embraced the history of the moment, savored it, she said, perhaps knowing that the next 18 games would not be so easily won.\njshaffer@baltsun.com\ntwitter.com/jonas—shaffer\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:07:27.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
