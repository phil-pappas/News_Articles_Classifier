(AP Photo/Kin Cheung) \nHONG KONG (AP) — Angelique Kerber of Germany beat fifth-seeded Samantha Stosur 6-2, 6-2 Saturday in the Hong Kong Open semifinals to move within one win of cementing her place in the WTA Finals in Singapore. \nThe second-seeded Kerber plays the winner of the other semifinal between Venus Williams and Jelena Jankovic. \nKerber can ensure she is part of the WTA Finals if she wins the Hong Kong Open. \nStosur had staged a remarkable comeback against Heather Watson in the quarterfinals by winning 11 straight games but the Australian couldn’t find the same touch against Kerber. \nKerber is chasing her fifth WTA singles title this year after victories in Charleston, Stuttgart, Birmingham and Stanford.
