On paper, at least, Monday's match-up against the Baltimore Ravens appears to be decidedly one-sided in the Cardinals favor. \nThe 4-2 Cardinals are one of the top scoring teams in the league with a ball hawking defense that leads the league in interceptions. The 1-5 Ravens, meantime, struggle to find the end zone offensively while giving up far too many yards and touchdowns through the air. \nBut don't be too quick to write the Ravens off. All five of their losses have gone down to the final minute. All five losses are by a touchdown or less. \nRavens quarterback Joe Flacco still possesses one of the strongest arms in the league. The offensive talent around him, however, is a little on the thin side. Running back Justin Forsett and venerable veteran wide receiver, Steve Smith, are the only true weapons Flacco has to work with. \nInjuries have stripped the Ravens defense of its identity and play makers including former ASU stand out, Terrell Suggs. On the other side of the field the Cardinals are loaded with play makers on both sides of the ball. So again, on paper, the Cardinals-Ravens showdown Monday night is a complete mismatch. And from where I'm sitting it shouldn't be much of a contest. \nPREDICTION: \nThe Cardinals are so focused to redeem themselves from their disappointing loss in Pittsburgh last week that nothing short of their \"A\" game will be on display. Add to that the extra adrenaline that comes with Monday night football and you have a Cardinals team that will be clicking on all cylinders. Carson Palmer will have a field day exploiting the Ravens weak secondary in front of the loud and boisterous \"Bird Gang\". \nFINAL SCORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:40:07.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
