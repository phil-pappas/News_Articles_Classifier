May room for improvement pa naman.”\nKullerkann posted 18 points, 15 coming from attacks, for Meralco, which absorbed its third straight defeat in as many outings.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:39:17.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
