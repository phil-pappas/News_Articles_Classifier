Oct 18, 2015; Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians talks with quarterback Carson Palmer (3) during the second half against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field. The Steelers won the game, 25-13. Mandatory Credit: Jason Bridge-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Jason Bridge-USA TODAY Sports) \nThe Baltimore Ravens are 1-5, sure, but they aren't necessarily a bad football team. \nAll five of their losses have been by six points or less. \nJoe Flacco is still a dangerous quarterback and, despite their record, the Ravens are a team the Cardinals can't overlook. \nMore Cardinals: Coops Crystal Ball- Cardinals ready for primetime \nBaltimore's defense hasn't been the same since the team lost Terrell Suggs in the first game of the season, but they still have 18 sacks this season, sixth best in the league. \nIt'll be another week where the Cardinals offensive line will need to protect Carson Palmer, and it'll be crucial for Arizona to establish the run. \nOne of the main reasons the Cards fell in Pittsburgh was because they could never really get the running game going, they'll need to change that come Monday night. \nMonday night madness \nFor some reason, the Arizona Cardinals on Monday Night Football have become tremendous television theater over the years. \nThe primetime football broadcast gave us such great moments as Dennis Green's 'They are who we thought they were' rant, and of course we shouldn't forget former quarterback Derek Anderson storming out of a press conference after being questioned about smiling during a blowout loss. <!--iframe--> \nWill this Monday night yield more postgame memories? <!--iframe--> \nWe'll have to wait and see. \nFinishing close games \nArizona's two losses have been by a combined 14 points, and the team had a shot to win both games down the stretch. \nThe Cardinals inability to finish off close games has been interesting this year, as that is usually a staple of a Bruce Arians coached team. \nIt'll be interesting to see how Monday's game turns out if it indeed is close late. \nWill the Cardinals be able to focus up and finish a close game if need be? \nWe'll find out Monday.
