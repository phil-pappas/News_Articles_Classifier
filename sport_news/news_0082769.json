Club owner Dietmar Hopp invited several leading players for a talk last week, and did not include Gisdol. \nHoffenheim is the eighth Bundesliga coaching job for Stevens — including two spells at both Schalke and Stuttgart. His contract with Stuttgart was not extended at the end of last season although he managed to steer the club away from relegation. \nGisdol became Hoffenheim coach in April 2013 and saved the club from relegation that season. His contract ran until 2018. \nBut Hoffenheim has only won six matches in 2015, going back to last season. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:54:34.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
