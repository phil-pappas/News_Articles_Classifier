What matters to me is that I am staying at Sevilla. It was important for me to keep progressing here. \n\"Playing at Sevilla this season is very important to me, it is where I wanted to be. I would say that every story about transfers has a grain of truth. But I try not to think about that. I went on holidays thinking only of playing for Sevilla the following season. A player must focus only on playing and there other people who are in charge of dealing with other stuff.\" \nOne way or another Club president Pepe Castro recently revealed they were in negotiations with the player to reward him with a pay rise. AS earlier this week revealed that the offer also included an increase of his current £22.2m release clause to £33.3m in order to be in a better position to negotiate his sale in the future. \nAnd Estadio Deportivo now claims that following a meeting between Krychowiak's agent, David Manasseh, and the brother of the footballer they have agreed to reject the first offer made by the club. The Spanish publication claims that the negotiations are going to continue as Krychowiak is likely to sign a new deal to see his salary increased. However, his agent doesn't want to accept a £33.3m clause because his intentions is that \"sooner rather than later bringing the player to the Premier League\". \nKrychowiak's agent has great contacts in the English football as is the partner of prestigious Jonathan Barnett in Stellar Group, the agency who represents the likes of Gareth Bale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:39:05.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
