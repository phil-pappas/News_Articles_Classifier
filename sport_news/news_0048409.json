Thompson is back with Maccabi Haifa after spending last season with Hapoel Tel Aviv. \nThe Lakers, playing their first preseason game at Staples Center following back-to-back losses to the Utah in Hawaii and another against Toronto at Ontario, California, opened with a 17-2 run while Maccabi Haifa missed nine of its first 10 shots. \nMACCABI HAIFA: Thompson, the second player off the bench, missed his first six shots before hitting a 3-pointer with 9:16 left in the third quarter. He finished 2 for 11 with eight points in 28 minutes. \nLAKERS: Lou Williams, who led the team in scoring in each of the first three exhibition games with a 17.7 average, had 13 points in 19 minutes. . F Julius Randle, who suffered a broken leg on opening night last season after just 14 minutes on the court and missed the rest of what should have been his rookie campaign, had 14 points and nine rebounds in 24 minutes. \nDID NOT PLAY: Lakers F Brandon Bass remained out with a bone bruise in his left knee, as did G Marcelo Huertas due to a right hamstring strain. . Maccabi Haifa swingman Nigel Spikes was sidelined with a sore right knee. \nUNITED NATIONS: The Lakers also have hosted preseason games against Maccabi Tel Aviv (1990) and FC Barcelona (2010). \nGIVE PEACE A CHANCE: Metta World Peace came off the Lakers' bench for the first time with 7:04 left in the fourth quarter and his team leading 116-67. \nBALL CONTROL: The Lakers converted 15 Maccabi Haifa turnovers into 30 points. The visitors scored 23 points off 22 Lakers turnovers. \nUP NEXT: Maccabi Haifa begins its regular-season schedule on Oct. 16, hosting Ironi Nahariya.
