Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports   1:40p ET \nToronto forward Tyler Bozak suffered a lower-body injury after blocking a shot in Friday's game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, and he was forced to miss Saturday's game against the Penguins when he wasn't improved 24 hours after the injury. It seems a weekend off hasn't helped much; Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock offered a mixed report on the forward's progress after Bozak was unable to practice Monday morning. true — David Alter (@dalter) October 19, 2015 No timeline for Bozak yet. \"Thought he would practice today\" said Babcock. — David Alter (@dalter) October 19, 2015 Babcock adds that he thinks Bozak will be ready to play Wednesday — David Alter (@dalter) October 19, 2015 \nBozak attempted to return to the game Friday after suffering the injury, but he was forced out of the game after just two shifts in the third period. The forward's attempt to return was a sign that the injury might not be that serious, but his continued inability to practice three days after suffering the injury is a sign that things might be worse than originally thought. \nBozak has two points (one goal, one assist) through four games this season. He recorded 49 points in each of his last two seasons in Toronto. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
