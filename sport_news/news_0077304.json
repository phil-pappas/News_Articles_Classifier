Jacob deGrom will start Game 2 at Kauffman Stadium, followed by rookies Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz when the best-of-seven series shifts to New York.\nCollins says the Mets wanted to give deGrom an extra day of rest and they like going into Kansas City with their top two starters. They also feel good about Syndergaard pitching at home, where he's been most successful.\nCollins said Harvey could be available out of the bullpen in a potential Game 7.\nHarvey shut down the Chicago Cubs in the NL Championship Series opener and won both his playoff starts.\nLast season's NL Rookie of the Year, deGrom is 3-0 with a 1.80 ERA in three postseason outings.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
