There will be four rallies in each of the next two phases and five in the final phase, making it clear that Modi remains the NDA's poll spearhead.\nBJP is confident that it could be winning 28 to 32 seats in the first phase that saw polling in 49 assembly seats and between 20-24 seats in the second phase of 32 seats. The party feels it is poised to consolidate its gains in the subsequent rounds of polling as well.\nThe five Modi rallies scheduled for the last phase, that includes the Seemanchal region which with a high minority population is seen as tough going for BJP, indicates the party sees polarization working for it too.\nThe issues of demographic changes in the Seemanchal and nearby areas have generated a lot of public resentment and this is working in favour of BJP and the party, far from seeing the area of low returns, is working to maximize its gains.\nIn BJP's assessment, the Dadri lynching incident is not resonating much in Bihar while the controversy over RJD chief Lalu Prasad's remarks about beef have only served to consolidate NDA's support.\nBJP does not see the Haryana chief minister M L Khattar's controversial remarks on Muslims and beef becoming an issue as the leader has said that he regrets having hurt anyone's sentiments.\nThe long-drawn election has taxed BJP as much as the opposition alliance and party president Amit Shah, along with several senior ministers and leaders, has been camping in Bihar for more than two weeks. Shah did the same in the Maharashtra polls last year when he spent 20-odd days in the state.\nThe Bihar elections have acquired an even higher profile with the result seen to have a bearing on the Modi government's capacity to steer its agenda through Parliament and take on its opponents over issues such alleged rise of intolerance and attacks on minorities and cultural critics.
