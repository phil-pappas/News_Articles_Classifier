Picture: Marie Nirme.\nRobert Craddock The Courier-Mail THEY may not attract the big bucks and huge crowds of their football rivals, but in some ways Australian hockey stars sacrifice even more.\nIf you want to be an Australian hockey star, the only way to do it is to pack up your life and head to Perth where the Australian men’s and women’s teams, the Kookaburras and the Hockeyroos, are based.\nIt’s a long way from anywhere and a wage which is a small fraction of what top footballers earn barely seems to do their commitment justice.\nBut that says everything about the hockey clan. They don’t play for the cash. They play because they love it.\nFormer national men’s and women’s coach Ric Charlesworth once said that despite both teams having to juggle schedules to assist players with interests outside the sport they were a joy to coach because they really — really — wanted to be there.\nTwo proud Queenslanders, Rockhampton product Mark Knowles and Brisbane’s Madonna Blyth, made the commitment to move to Perth long ago and the reward is they are likely to captain the Australian men’s and women’s teams to next years Olympics in Brazil.\n“It is a big decision (to move to Perth) especially when you consider you have youngsters who are 18 or 19 making the move but if you are realistic about making your best hockey this is the place to do it,’’ Blyth said from Perth.\n“One of the advantages of our program is we get to live together and training together day in, day out which is something that a lot of other countries don’t do.’’\nKnowles and Blyth will head to New Zealand today to play the Oceania Cup series but next year’s Rio Games are coming strongly into view.\nRecently they led their Queensland teams to national title wins which were overshadowed by the massive publicity which trailed the Broncos and Cowboys to their historic grand final.\nRockhampton-raised Knowles, last year’s world player of the year and a 2004 Olympic gold medallist, is a self-confessed hockey tragic who could talk the game all night.\nHis commitment to its development is such that when he plays for a Punjabi side in the Hockey league India he readily spends spare time coaching young Indians.\nBlyth is likely to retire after Rio.\n“I just want to make it to Rio first and play well but realistically that will be the time I look to finish,’’ she said. “I am lucky enough to have had a great career and I want to make sure I am in my best form in Rio to get the result we are chasing.’’\n“When they kicked over to the one year mark to Rio it seemed close and since then it has gone even quicker. There is only a limited amount of chances left.\n“We were pretty disappointed how we have gone in the last couple of Olympics and since then we have worked really hard to drop our ranking. We know we have worked to do but we are happy where we are at.’’\n Going West is best for our hockey captains", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2c65e5d09a44f75ad6c7b3ca791c5b2d", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/more-sports/kookaburras-and-hockeyroos-captains-head-west-ahead-of-rio-tilt/story-fnii0hmo-1227572317797"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:29:51.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
