Senior defender Brandon Vincent converted a penalty kick in the 15th minute, and freshman forward Foster Langsdorf added another in the 18th minute. \nThe Bears (5-3, 0-1) fought back, cutting the lead in half in the 31st minute with a Jose Carrera-Garcia penalty kick. \nSan Jose State had been shut out on the road in its previous five matches. But a Rory Knibbs goal in the ninth minute sparked the Spartans to a 2-1 victory in its Western Athletic Conference opener against the host University of Incarnate Word Cardinals. \nThe goal came on the team's first shot of the match and is his fifth goal of the season. It ended a team road-scoreless streak at 458:20. \nSan Jose State (3-6, 1-0 WAC) got its second goal of the half, and what turned out to be the game-winner, on a Knibbs penalty kick at the 40-minute mark. It was his third game-winner of the season. \nGoals by Haley Rosen and Andi Sullivan, and the overtime winner by Kyra Carusa, propelled the No. 5 Stanford women's team past host No. 17 Arizona 3-2. \nIn the overtime, the ball bounced off a couple Arizona defenders before finding the left foot of Carusa, who kicked the ball into the back of the net for the game-winner. It is Carusa's third goal of the season and second game-winner in Pac-12 play after netting the game-winning goal at Utah in the conference opener.

Kiana Quarles scored the game's only goal and the Gaels' Julia McDonald made six saves in goal. Field hockey Cal (7-4) earned its first shutout of the season, blanking UC Davis 1-0 at Aggie Field Hockey Facility. Freshman Melina Moore scored her fifth goal of the season. College volleyball Senior Lara Vukasovic recorded nine kills and two blocks but Cal (6-9, 0-4 Pac-12) fell to No. 6 Arizona State 25-17, 25-19, 25-19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:21:45.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
