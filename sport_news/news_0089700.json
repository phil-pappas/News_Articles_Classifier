HACKENSACK – The Passaic Tech football team made Friday night about the reign, not the rain.\nWith wind whipping amid a downpour that lasted the entire game, Passaic Tech continued its reign of success against Hackensack by shutting out the Comets on the road, 20-0.\nThe convincing victory improved Passaic Tech (4-0), ranked No. 5 in The Record Public Top 20, to 8-0 against fourth-ranked Hackensack (2-2) since the teams began playing regularly in 2009. The Bulldogs have beaten Hackensack by a combined 129-19 in the four meetings between these North 1, Group 5 rivals since 2013.\n“No matter how much [Hackensack] wanted it, our kids felt like they had something to prove,’’ Passaic Tech coach Matt Demarest said. “The kids felt like, ‘Hey, we had guys graduate and all of a sudden everybody forgets about us.’ So I think they took that as a little personal deal, too.”\nPassaic Tech lost several important components from a team that went 10-2 last season and reached the North 1, Group 5 championship game. The Bulldogs demonstrated Friday night, however, that they’re good enough to make another run.\nTheir defense was dominant against a Hackensack team that averaged 40.0 points in its first three games. Though the weather was a factor for both offenses, the Bulldogs allowed the Comets’ offense just three first downs and became the first team to shut out Hackensack since Wayne Hills beat the Comets, 35-0, in 2012.\nSenior defensive tackle Isiah Tolbert led the Bulldogs with nine tackles, including three for losses, a sack and a fumble recovery.\n“This win means a lot for us,” said Ahzir McGuire, Passaic Tech’s junior middle linebacker. “To not have them score, when they’ve scored so much against the other teams, it fuels that fire inside.”\nMcGuire made back-to-back tackles for losses to force a Hackensack punt late in the third quarter. By then, Passaic Tech led, 13-0.\nThe Bulldogs took a 7-0 lead into halftime, but Jermaine Wilder changed the complexion of the game by returning a kickoff 86 yards for a touchdown to start the third quarter.\nPassaic Tech botched the exchange on its extra-point attempt, but going up 13-0 made matters much more difficult on a Hackensack offense that didn’t complete a pass until its final drive of the game.\n“We felt that gave us a little room to breathe,” Demarest said. “They were coming hard after us, and that gave us room to actually take a deep breath.”\nPassaic Tech increased its lead to 20-0 thanks to a 1-yard touchdown run by senior tailback Ricky Francis with 3:50 to go in the game. .\nFrancis, who finished with 87 yards on 17 carries, rushed for a 2-yard score that helped Passaic Tech take a 7-0 second-quarter lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:29.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
