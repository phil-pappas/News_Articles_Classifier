And tonight we were,” Funk said. After brainstorming with his coaching staff, Funk found the perfect storm to combat a deep Blue Knights defense: A steady dose of senior running back Andrew Jamiel. The 5-foot-10, 160-pound Jamiel put the Dolphins on his back, carrying the load to the tune of 20 carries for 206 yards and three touchdowns, plus a 50-yard punt return for a touchdown, as the Dolphins downed ACL foe Sandwich, 28-6. “[Andrew]’s as good as it gets. The offensive line moved people up front when they had to. I think everyone factored into Andrew’s touchdowns … except for maybe the punt return. That was on his own,” Funk said. After being bottled up by top-ranked Marshfield last week in a 38-6 league loss, Jamiel rattled off his second 200-yard performance through four games in 2015 -- his first a 216-yard, five touchdown game against rival Barnstable on September 11. Jamiel sparked his scoring surge at the 7:40 mark in the second quarter by taking an inside handoff from sophomore quarterback Jacob McCarthy for 40 yards -- capping a two-play drive that lasted 45 seconds. The D-Y defense forced Sandwich’s offense to a three-and-out on their first possession of the second half after a net gain of only two yards. The Blue Knights, running a pass-oriented spread offense, were nullified by the weather conditions and looked a step slower than D-Y to the ball. On the ensuing punt, Jamiel fielded the ball at midfield, found a seam and then the end zone, cutting through the wind and the Blue Knight defenders in the process. His second touchdown and first two-point conversion put the Dolphins in front 14-0 with 10 minutes to play in the third quarter. Sandwich (2-2) then put together its best drive of the evening -- an 11-play, no huddle drive capped by a Joseph Boudrow 23-yard touchdown run. The junior running back rushed 20 times for 88 yards, carrying Dolphin defenders for the majority of those runs. The score brought Sandwich within striking distance at 14-6 with 4:30 left in the third quarter. That’s as close as they would get, as two drives later Jamiel took the ball off the left tackle for 46 yards for his third touchdown. He converted the two-point conversion to put the game out of reach for good at 22-6. After Sandwich turned the ball over on downs, it took Jamiel just two runs -- both of 23 yards -- to find the end zone for the fourth time of the night and close the game out.
