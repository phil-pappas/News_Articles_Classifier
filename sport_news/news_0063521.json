More from KDLT Current, Former SD Tribal Officials Face Embezzling Counts \nThe university plans to break ground next month on the facility, which will include updated practice and training facilities for football and basketball teams that officials say are necessary to keep the school competitive in the Big 10. \nThe university has raised about $76.5 million of the cost from donors.
