McIntosh was led by Alyssa LeClaire’s fourth-place finish in 19:08. \nUnion Grove, McIntosh and Starr’s Mill combined for 15 of the top 17 girls finishers. \nNorthgate’s Caroline Nelson, who put together a solid ninth-place effort, joined Glorvigen as the Lady Vikings’ top-10 contributors. \nThe team also picked up scorers from senior Erica Lee (21:19) and sophomores Sydney Tuttle (21:29) and Hannah Skiotis (21:30). \nTuttle’s older brother, Andrew, crossed eighth in 16:45 to pace the Vikings finishers in a tight pack among the boys. Only 33 seconds separated Fultz’s win from McIntosh freshman Zach Jaeger (16:49) in 10th. \nJuniors Jaelin Rainey (15th, 16:55) and Sherman Dewey (17th, 17:00) paced the Vikings’ effort. Freshman Michael Nelson capped off the scoring in 30th place in 17:58. \nEast Coweta and host Newnan will compete in Saturday’s Region 3- championships at the Newnan Utilities reservoir on Saturday.
