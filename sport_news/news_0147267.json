He inked a 10-year extension with the Angels in 2009, but he can forgo $18 million in salary and leave the organization this fall.\nScioscia has managed the Angels since 2000, collecting one World Series title (2002) and two American League Manager of the Year awards (2002, 2009). He has compiled a 1,416-1,175 record over his 16-year tenure in Los Angeles.\nThe Angels are also expected to name Billy Eppler the club's new general manager Monday.\nCopyright © 2015 Score Media Ventures Inc.
