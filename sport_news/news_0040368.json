Santa Clara County District Attorney spokeswoman Cynthia Sumida said Wednesday that Smith's attorney entered the not guilty pleas on his client's behalf on Sept. 29.\nThe 25-year-old Smith was arrested in August in Santa Clara on drunken driving charges.\nIn a separate incident, Smith was arrested on April 13, 2014, at Los Angeles International Airport. Police said Smith was randomly selected for a secondary screening and became uncooperative with the process, telling a TSA agent that he had a bomb. No charges were filed.\nDuring the 2014 season, he received a nine-game suspension for what the league called violations of its policies on substance abuse and personal conduct.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:42:41.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
