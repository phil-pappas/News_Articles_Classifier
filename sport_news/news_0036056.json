(Photo: Courtesy of Marcus Calverley) \n“I could talk about all the Harbaugh hype and the disrespect Michigan State is being hit with all over the country from national media. The arrogance of many U of M fans. \n“I could write many blog posts about the game. \n“But, and I almost can't believe I'm saying this: \n“This year, it's just a game.” \n- Marcus Calverley, Oct. 14, from his blog \"Cancer, My Dog, and My Beard\" \nSaturday afternoon marks the 108th rivalry renewal between Michigan State and Michigan. \nSaturday also marks the one-year anniversary of Marcus Calverley’s first chemotherapy treatment. \nMarcus Calverley, with his hair and beard (Photo: Courtesy of Marcus Calverley) \nThe East Lansing High graduate and former MSU football player, once full of bravado and strength, is now a scared, ailing 29-year-old battling an opponent that doesn’t discriminate between green and blue. \nCancer. \n“Those lines get blurred when it comes to health,” Calverley said this week, while recovering in his East Lansing apartment from another aggressive round of treatment. “It puts the game in perspective.” \nAfter being diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in August of 2014, Calverley immediately knew where to go. His mother, Sue, had died from breast cancer a decade earlier. She sought out the best care from the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. \nHer son would do the same. A Spartan fighting alongside his team of Wolverines. \n“Looked to the right at a 40-45 year old woman, with her teenage daughter with her. The woman had a double mastectomy. She was incredibly thin. Her lips were very chapped and it looked like a handful of fingernails had fallen off. Her kid typed away on her cell phone, but I watched as the woman kept shifting positions in the recliner, trying to find a pain-free position. \n“She looked a ton like I remember my mom when I was 18 …. I suppose that's when it hit me; that in my insulated little world, I could tell myself I didn't really belong here. This is a blip, and it may very well turn out to be that for me, but that I needed to stop pretending.” \n- Oct. 17, 2014 Buy Photo \nMarcus Calverley (52) was an LSJ Dream Team defensive tackle at East Lansing High as a senior in 2003 and also earned 2004 all-area honors in baseball as a senior. (Photo: Lansing State Journal file photo) \nCalverley was the All-American kid at East Lansing High School, a good-looking, multisport star athlete with a ton of friends. He was a 2003 Lansing State Journal Dream Team selection in football as a defensive tackle and an all-area infielder in baseball for the Trojans his senior year. Colleges wanted him, but he opted to fulfill his dream of becoming a Spartan as a preferred walk-on in the fall of 2004. \nMarcus Calverley's mother, Sue, died following a bout with breast cancer in 2005. She was 49. Marcus, now 29, was diagnosed with cancer in 2014. (Photo: Courtesy of Marcus Calverley) \n“Growing up in East Lansing, my grandfather taught at State, my father went to State,” Calverley said. “There was no way I was going to go anywhere else.” \nHis joie de vivre belied what was happening at home. \nCalverley's mom, a real estate agent who volunteered at the East Lansing High concession stand during her children’s activities, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She fought it into remission in 1996, thanks to her treatments at U-M’s hospital. The family — father Steve, Marcus, his older brothers Ryan and Adam and their younger sister, Sara — grew even closer with the fragility of the situation. \nA plaque for Sue Calverley adorns the side of the concession stand at East Lansing High School's Lynn C. Adams Stadium. (Photo: Courtesy of Marcus Calverley) \nSue was elected president of the Downtown Coaches Club when Marcus was starting his college career across town. Toward the end of his first semester at MSU, however, her cancer returned with renewed aggression. Marcus would miss football workouts to help and spend as much time with her as he could. At times, he would use the weight room as his retreat from real life. \n“Ken Mannie and the strength and conditioning staff are some of my favorite people on earth,” Marcus said. “They were instrumental for sure in getting me through that, giving me something to do, something to look forward to so I could take my mind off all that.” \nCancer claimed Sue Calverley on Feb. 21, 2005. She was 49. \n“I feel bad for people who don't like sports. \n“Especially people with cancer who don't like sports. I'm sure they can find other things to distract them, but I have a hard time imagining they work as well as the games this weekend have for me.” \n- Oct. 26, 2014, after MSU defeated Michigan and the Lions also won \nMarcus Calverley, second from left, and his family at Notre Dame Stadium following MSU's 44-41 overtime win against the Irish on Sept. 18, 2005. Calverley was a walkon and the backup long snapper for the Spartans on that team. (Photo: Courtesy of Marcus Calverley) \nIn the fall of 2005, redshirt freshman Calverley began to travel with MSU’s football team. He served as the Spartans’ backup long snapper and played on other special teams units. His appearances were fleeting. He stood in uniform on the sideline as MSU missed two field goals in a 34-31 overtime loss at home to Michigan. \nAlmost as quickly as his dream of playing for the Spartans began, it ended. \nMarcus Calverley gives a thumbs-up before MSU's game against Notre Dame in 2005.

Calverley approached then-coach John L. Smith about what his potential role would be that fall. Smith told Calverley he didn’t think he would be traveling with the team that year. It caught Calverley off-guard. \n“It kind of burned me out,” Calverley remembered. \nHe hung up his pads before the season began and began to “embrace the college experience” away from athletics. But football's siren call continued, and Calverley transferred to play the 2007 season at Albion College. He made 23.5 tackles while playing in 10 games that year for the Britons before returning to MSU to earn his degree in communications in 2009. \n“It was great to play again,” Calverley said. “It was fun to enjoy the game again. At the level of Michigan State, especially when you’re losing, it turns into more of a job than a game.” \nThe real world awaited. With it came real-life concerns again. \n“I'm learning that it's a constant mental battle, much more so than physical. It's avoiding the thought or feeling that this will never end. That's been harder than I thought it would be. \n“Still: \n“Was never told it would be easy, so forward we go.” \n- Oct. 12 \nMarcus Calverley had surgery to remove a tumor in his chest. Doctors determined in August 2014 that the growth was cancerous. (Photo: Courtesy of Marcus Calverley) \nCalverley is the assistant general manager at The Riviera Café, just off campus and not far from where he grew up. In May of 2014, he started having side pain. His first thought: a golf injury. An MRI, instead, found a massive tumor in his chest, near the base of his sternum. \nInitially, doctors thought it was benign. Surgery was scheduled to remove the tumor. A post-operation biopsy revealed it was cancerous, Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \nCalverley had to recover from the surgery for nearly three months before he could begin treating the cancer. There was only one place he would go: Back to Ann Arbor and Michigan’s cancer center, the same place that cared for his mother. \n“For me, it was tougher to see my family react to it,” he said. “Hodgkin’s lymphoma is considered a treatable cancer, but you never know. I tried to stay positive about it, probably faked it a little bit for my family’s sake.” \nMarcus Calverley and his dog, Griswold, are on the cover of the fall edition of Thrive magazine, which is produced by the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. (Photo: Courtesy of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center) \nAt the urging of friends, Calverley on Oct. 7, 2014, created a blog to chronicle his treatment and keep his family up to date with his thoughts and treatment. “Cancer, My Dog, and My Beard” blends humor, emotions and passion. It shows how cancer doesn’t keep Calverley from continuing to live his life, and also the changes and pain he is dealing with. \nFirst came six months of chemotherapy, which began 10 days after his blog. He relapsed, like most patients do, and had to undergo a second, heavier round of “salvage” chemo for another three months. About a month ago, he returned to Ann Arbor for a stem cell transplant that has him homebound as he recovers. \n“It’s a strange thing to complain about. But it’s tough when you’re feeling good and you can’t do anything,” he said. “The days pass slow, so I write, I read, I do whatever I can to pass the time. It’s a mental grind, really, more than anything.” \nDr. Tycel Phillips, a professor in internal medicine and Calverley’s physician at U-M’s Comprehensive Cancer Center, said his patient’s football days have helped him with the process. \nThese days, Marcus Calverley's hair and beard are both shaved due to treatments on his cancer. (Photo: Courtesy of Marcus Calverley) \n“A lot of mental toughness is required to go through all of these treatments, especially with the fatigue and some of the other side effects that come along with it,” Phillips said. “Your mental health will affect how you cope with the treatment and how we’re able to treat you. His background has helped him a lot, and he’s come through like a champ with all of this.” \nEvery time he’s gone to U-M’s cancer center, though, Calvarley has made sure he wears his Spartan gear when he goes in for treatment. Phillips said good-natured joking goes on there between Spartans and Wolverines, and the nurse practitioner he works with is an MSU graduate. Everything is meant in good fun, a respite from the seriousness that occupies patients’ minds. \nFormer MSU football player Marcus Calverley and his girlfriend, former Spartan softball player Emma Fernandez, share a smile at an MSU football game. (Photo: Courtesy of Marcus Calverley) \nCalverley said he plans to watch the game at home Saturday. His girlfriend, Emma Fernandez, is a former MSU softball player. They’ll be cheering for the green and white, naturally. \nBut they’ll also be praising the maize and blue. \n“It doesn’t mean I’m not a huge fan and I won’t be living and dying with every play on Saturday,” Calverley said. “But when the game’s over, it’s just a game, man.” HOW TO HELP \nFormer East Lansing High and Michigan State football player Marcus Calverley was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a form of cancer, in the fall of 2014 after a tumor was found at the base of his sternum. The 29-year-old has undergone a series of treatments including chemotherapy, radiation and stem cell transplants at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center that have left him unable to work for the next three months. His aunt, Luanne Frantz, has started a GoFundMe page to help Calverley raise $20,000 to help him during his recovery. You can donate at https://www.gofundme.com/CalsCancerHelpFund . “CANCER, MY DOG, AND MY BEARD” \nSince October of 2014, Marcus Calverley has chronicled his tumultuous road from diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma throughout his chemotherapy treatment at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center in a blog, writing honestly and with levity about his daily struggles with cancer, his passion for MSU sports and his zest for living. His writing blends equal parts sadness, joy, insight, vulgarity and humor.
