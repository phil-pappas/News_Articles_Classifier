By Jenel Few R esidents of Signature HealthCare Nursing Home put up garlands, blue bows and white paper bells Saturday, then lined their wheelchairs up around the wedding arch in the activity room.\nThey had all helped prepare for the wedding of nursing home Chaplain Danny Smith and activity director Angela Peacock — and the big day had finally arrived.\nFacility Administrator Helen Burnworth had been ordained specifically to help the other ordained members of staff officiate the nuptials. One resident made the bride’s blue and white bouquet. The resident council president served as the best man.\nAn elderly resident wearing a flowered headband and carrying a basket full of flower petals served as flower girl. She wheeled herself down the activity room aisle Saturday afternoon, tossing blue flower petals along the way.\nPeacock said she and Smith could have had a fancier ceremony at one of the many beautiful wedding venues in Savannah, but they chose to have their wedding with beautiful people in a place that was most meaningful to them.\n“We met here,” Peacock said, “and they are our family. They’re part of why we fell in love.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14800333.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14800335.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14800337.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14800337.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14800335.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14800333.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:15:45.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
