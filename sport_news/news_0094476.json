Rodriguez scored off a cross from Heather O’Reilly. Just moments later there was a scary moment when Holiday went down and a stretcher was brought on to the field. Holiday walked to the sideline on her own and eventually returned for the final minutes of her last competitive game. Holiday announced plans to step away from the game in July, shortly after winning the Fifa Women’s World Cup with the US national team, but she vowed to first finish out the season with her NWSL club.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:29:15.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
