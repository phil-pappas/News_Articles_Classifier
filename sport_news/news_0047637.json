It is being used to help students learn on a variety of topics outside of the classroom. \n\"I grew up with that agricultural background so it's just good to know more about it.\" Clayton Sorum said. \n\"I learned a lot about radio control and remote control, and how to use technology in such a great way,\" Patrick Minihan said. \nTechnology that allows these high school juniors to fly this drone high above the city and analyze what they find. \n\"It makes learning fun, you know. I'm actually excited to come to class everyday. You come out and the first day he said, 'Let's go fly the drone.\" That was unreal,\" Sorum said. \"It made you want to keep coming back and learning more.\" \nSpecifically about wildlife, livestock, natrual resources avaition and agronomy. \n\"We're hearing from the industry that agronomy is one of the most high demand areas right now,\" Swanson said. \"That's what we're trying to do, is get some of these students trained for that so they can go right into college and have this knowledge. So when they come out, they're race ready.\"\"Other schools don't actually have this so it's one other thing under your belt you can have,\" Christian Swensen said. \nThe drone can fly as high as 400 feet, it can travel as fast as 30 miles per hour with a 4-mile radius. \n\"Hands-on, practical learning is the way students want to learn and they want to see instant results and this just exemplifies that,\" Swanson said. \n\"There's always something new, and you go out and you're excited to do this kind of stuff everyday and it's just kind of fun,\" Minihan said.
