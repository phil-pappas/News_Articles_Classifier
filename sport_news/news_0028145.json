Since then, the country has been divided between his supporters and the Bangkok-based elite which sees him as a threat to the old royalist-military establishment.\nFor more than a decade, the country has seen at times violent street protests from both Thaksin supporters and their opponents.\nThaksin, whose parties have won every election since 2001, tapped into the changing aspirations of the working class.\nBut his popularity with Bangkok's middle class soon waned and he was accused of vote-buying and harbouring republican sympathies, among other accusations, all of which he denies.\nFrom his base in Dubai, Thaksin travels frequently to Africa and Asia where he has business interests.\nYingluck swept to power in 2011 on a wave of rural support but was ordered to step down after a court found her guilty of abusing power. â€”Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:11:24.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
