He made it through a complete practice Sunday, taking contact for the first time since getting the shot. The four-time MVP said the big test would be how his body responded after the workout.\nFollowing Monday's practice, James said he's \"ready to go.\" The 30-year-old shook his head and said, \"nope\" when asked if there was any doubt he would be available when the Cavaliers open the season.\nCoach David Blatt said the Cavs will be \"cautious and careful\" with the minutes they play James, who missed a career-high 13 games last season with injuries and has played nearly 44,000 minutes as a pro.\nCopyright 2015 All rights reserved.
