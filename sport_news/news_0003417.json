The Patriots will have to figure out a new plan for the third tackle on the game-day roster, and that could be practice squad member Cameron Fleming. That transaction could come later in the week.\nFor now, the Pats have used their 53rd roster spot to pick up cornerback Rashaan Melvin, who was claimed off waivers from the Baltimore Ravens. Melvin has shown some potential but was benched in Week 3 and released yesterday when the Ravens shook up their roster with a flurry of moves after losing four of their first five games of the season.\nSolder allowed two sacks and two quarterback hits against the Cowboys, and he surrendered a team-high three sacks through four games. However, he has historically improved over the course of each season, and the loss will also be felt in the ground game, as the Patriots routinely like to run to the left side.\nOn Sept. 9, Solder signed a two-year, $20.062 million contract extension that included a $12.5 million signing bonus. He remains under contract with the Patriots through the 2017 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:26:47.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
