Carson, a Clemson University graduate student who advocates removing Tillman’s name from that school’s Tillman Hall, said he was “not surprised” by the poll results. \n“We talk about the so-called idea of rewriting history,” Carson said. But, he added, people do not spend enough time “attempting to empathize with the people who might be offended.” \nOnly a third of S.C. residents said the name changes should not require legislative approval. The poll surveyed 963 S.C. adults from Sept. 20 to 27, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. \nFolks advocating name changes, if they hope to win, have to do a lot more work educating people. – Winthrop Poll director Scott Huffmon \n“Folks advocating name changes, if they hope to win, have to do a lot more work educating people” on the issue, said Scott Huffmon, Winthrop Poll director. \nRace and politics, he added, played some role in how those surveyed responded. Still, a majority of Republicans and Democrats and whites and blacks said the state should decide whether to rename buildings. However, more whites and Republicans felt that way than blacks and Democrats. \nThe poll comes almost three months after state lawmakers decided to remove the Confederate flag from the State House grounds. They acted after pictures surfaced of the accused killer of nine African Americans at a Charleston church posing with the Rebel banner. Removing the flag would help the state heal, flag opponents said. \nThe historic move required the support of two-thirds of lawmakers in the S.C. House and Senate. Afterward, House Speaker Jay Lucas, R-Darlington, vowed not to address any other historical monuments or memorials. \nLawmakers created the two-thirds hurdle as part of a 2000 compromise that moved the Confederate flag from atop the State House dome, where it had flown since the 1960s, to a flag pole near the Confederate Soldier Monument on the Capitol grounds. At the time, lawmakers feared backlash against other historical markers, so they voted to give themselves the final say on any changes to other monuments or memorials. \nEfforts to alter historic monuments in some S.C. communities now are being blocked by that state law. \nIn Greenwood, the local American Legion wants to replace segregated plaques commemorating that county’s fallen servicemen from World War I and World War II with a single plaque that does not identify who is “white” or “colored.” \nReacting to the Winthrop Poll results, Greenwood Mayor Welborn Adams, who supports the effort to change the monument’s plaques, said most people initially see the issue as trying to change history. \n“Whenever I’ve been able to explain that our monument was constructed by a local American Legion, and it’s the American Legion’s right to change it, that alters people’s perception,” Adams said. \nIn Florence, the city and veterans are at odds over a similar dilemma, fighting over whether to desegregate a World War I monument’s plaque that honors fallen servicemen. \nSouth Carolinians probably know little, if anything, about those communities’ debates, Winthrop’s Huffmon said. \n“While the flag as a symbol was integrally connected with a story that everybody heard about this summer, a lot of people aren’t hearing the debate about buildings and parks,” Huffmon said. \n“The default (attitude) is, there’s a law and it sounds reasonable.” \nReach Self at (803)771-8658 \nPreserving history? \nWinthrop asked: “Under the current law, if a university or local government wishes to change the name of a street, park, or building which is named after a historical figure or event, it must obtain the approval of the South Carolina state legislature with a two-thirds vote. Do you think universities and local governments should or should not be able to rename streets, parks, or buildings named after historical figures or events without seeking approval of the state legislature?” \nAll polled 63 percent: No, should require the Legislature’s approval 32 percent : Yes, should be able to rename without Legislature’s OK 6 percent : Not sure, don’t know or refused to answer \nRepublicans and GOP leaning 68 percent: No, should require Legislature’s approval 28 percent: Yes, should be able to rename without Legislature’s OK 4 percent: Not sure, don’t know or refused to answer \nDemocrats and Democratic leaning 55 percent: No, should require Legislature’s approval 41 percent: Yes, should he able to rename without Legislature’s OK 4 percent: Not sure, don’t know or refused to answer Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:38:47.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
