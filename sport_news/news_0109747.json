Thomas McMillen was handed the keys Monday, kicking off the organization's annual meeting.\nThe not-for-profit organization, comprised of athletic directors from the 126 NCAA Division I-A institutions, will move its headquarters from Grapevine to Washington, D.C.\nThat's fitting given McMillen's role of helping to steer members through the ever-changing maze of college athletics while the organization expands its support efforts.\n\"I have always advocated for the student-athlete, and this opportunity will allow me to continue that work,\" McMillen said in a statement. \"The 126 athletic programs that constitute the Division I-A Athletic Directors' Association are a powerful force in meeting the needs of student athletes -- and we want to do even better in helping those student-athletes in the future.\"\nMcMillen replaces longtime executive director Dutch Baughman, former athletic director at Oregon State, Virginia Tech, and Furman and associate commissioner of the former Southwest Conference.\nMcMillen is chairman/CEO of the investment firm Washington Capital Advisors. He also serves as a director of RCS Capital and Nexstar Broadcasting Group, a media and broadcast company. He is treasurer of The National Foundation on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition.\nMcMillen, a regent in the University of Maryland system, helped found the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics.\nOrganizing the ADs: Members spent much of the day discussing ways to enhance the organization's impact on all members. One change will be the name, which has yet to be determined.\n\"A lot of the focus was on the direction of the organization and kind of redefining our purpose and structure,\" SMU athletic director Rick Hart said. \"We spent some time talking about how the association will move forward and how it can best serve us.\"\nSMU hoops still waiting: The Mustangs have not heard from the NCAA regarding possible sanctions on the basketball and golf programs. School officials met with the Committee on Infractions in June, responding to a list of allegations. The NCAA often announces its findings within six to eight weeks.\nHall of Fame coach Larry Brown reportedly could be cited for \"lack of control\" if it is determined he knew that former assistant Ulric Maligi and a former secretary helped guard Keith Frazier with course work. Frazier, from Kimball, was ruled academically ineligible in January and missed the rest of his sophomore season.\nOnce a decision is made, SMU can accept or appeal the findings.\n\"We're not even at that stage of the process yet,\" Hart said. \"I don't know anything more about the timing and when we might advance that process than anyone else does.\"\nSetting dates: SMU is working with Baylor and TCU on future schedules. With the current series with Baylor ending next year, Hart said he hopes to get the Bears back on the schedule. He and TCU athletic director Chris Del Conte said they expect the long rivalry to continue without interruption.\n\"It's been a great rivalry,\" Conte said. \"Regionalism, that's what's needed in college football.\"\nHart said it's important for SMU to continue playing former Southwest Conference rivals. The Mustangs do not leave the state until their seventh game at South Florida. They have played Baylor, North Texas and TCU, and after James Madison this week, have East Carolina at home and then Houston on the road Oct. 8.\n\"It feels a little odd, but that's been helpful\" Hart said of staying close to home. \"I think it is good when you're trying to build a culture and a fan base [with new coach Chad Morris].\"\nOn Twitter:\n @BillNicholsDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BillNicholsDMN"], "published": "2015-09-22T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:43:45.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
