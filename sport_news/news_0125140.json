He had told his team about his decision Monday night, according to ESPN.\"It was only two years ago that we were fourth in the nation ... and somehow or another we've slid and it's my fault -- I'm responsible, I'm the head coach. And it's time for me to sort of get out of the way and let somebody else have a go at it,\" Spurrier said Tuesday.So far this season, the Gamecocks are 2-4 and seventh in SEC East with an 0-4 record in the Southeastern Conference.\"I think the team needs to hear a new message, a new voice from another coach. And Shawn's going to do that, and I think he's going to do an outstanding job,\" Spurrier said, referring to Shawn Elliott, the team's co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, who has been named the interim coach. \nCopyright   Tuesday, October 13, 2015 at 1:26PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:05:07.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
