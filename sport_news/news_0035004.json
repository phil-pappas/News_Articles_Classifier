But government lawyers filed court papers that suggested he was using a shell company , TWG Advisors, to stash drug proceeds.\nThen the feds came back.\nAgents raided Wheeler's home this past April, seizing another 331 cannabis plants, a MasterCraft sport boat and trailer and a Ford pickup, according to government court papers intended to claim the property through forfeiture. Inside a safe, they found $9,000 in cash, two bags of marijuana and a sack of powder believed to be ecstasy, the papers said.\nWheeler's lawyer, David Angeli , declined to comment on the new government filing in Portland's U.S. District Court.\nWheeler – a certified public accountant, real estate investor, medical marijuana grower and former co-owner of a Portland strip club – was previously accused in court papers of misappropriating the trust fund of two porn shop heirs and ripping off legendary two-time Olympic snowboarding medalist Danny Kass .\n\"Wheeler has used his position as a CPA to secure investment money from his clients, typically promising a 12 percent rate of return on their investment money,\" according to a declaration filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court by IRS Special Agent Scott McGeachy .\nThe agent alleged that Wheeler diverted clients' money – including $962,500 from one client identified as \"D.K.\" – and laundered it through various bank accounts tied to BVW Fund Two and TWG Advisors.\nAgents fanned out during last April's search to comb through three other locations associated with Wheeler and his former business partner, Jeremy Swanlund . (The two men had terminated their partnership in the Bridge City Advisors accounting practice and the Club Rouge strip joint after the first search).\n\"Wheeler and Swanlund each began to manufacture marijuana at their separate locations,\" McGeachy's declaration alleges.\nPortland lawyer Ron Hoevet , who represents Swanlund, denied any criminal wrongdoing by his client.\n\"Jeremy had a legal medical marijuana grow,\" Hoevet said. \"They searched the property and I think he was in compliance\" with plant counts permitted under the law.\n-- Bryan Denson\nbdenson@oregonian.com\n503-294-7614; @Bryan_Denson", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Bryan_Denson"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:21:15.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
