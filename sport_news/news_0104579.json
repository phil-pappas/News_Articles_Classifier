No. 1 Wayne Hills (13-2) vs. No. 2 Clifton (14-0-1) Today at Clifton Stadium, 2:30 p.m. \nHow they got here: Wayne Hills beat Passaic Tech, 3-0, and Wayne Valley, 2-0; Clifton beat Hawthorne, 4-0, and Lakeland, 0-0 (4-2, shootout) \nKey players: Wayne Hills — Meghan Griffin, F; Deana Abdou, D; Cameron Santers, M; Callen Vander May, D; Alexis Long, M; Danielle McCall, F; Olivia Prusakowski, D; Lynnea Kolpon, M. Clifton — Meaghan Mancini, M/F; Brittany Morales, M; Chelsea Robinson, D; Daniella LoBue, M; Carly Egyed, G; Maria Orozco, M/F; Olivia DeMuro, M; Kelly Aguilar-Almazo, M. \nStory line: For the fifth straight year and sixth time in seven seasons, the Passaic championship will be decided in a contest featuring Wayne Hills and Clifton. The Mustangs are making their seventh straight appearance in the final, but it’s the Patriots who have won the last two and three of the last four. Clifton already has a victory over Wayne Hills this season, 2-1, in double overtime in a steady rain Oct. 1, getting the winning penalty kick late in extra time from Mancini after a controversial call in the box. It’s a game Wayne Hills hasn’t forgotten. Griffin (13 goals, including two in semifinals) and Santers (seven assists) pace the Patriots’ offense, while Mancini (17 G, 7 A) and Morales (11 G, 6 A) are involved in many of the Mustangs’ scoring chances. Vander May (WH) and Robinson (Clifton) are two of the best defenders in North Jersey. The past three finals have been one-goal games. It could be another one today featuring two talented and familiar foes. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:32:43.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
