And so far he’s 2-for-2. \nDitze pulled senior Zach Ringhoff in favor of junior Danny Fisher in the season opener at Union. Fisher promptly tossed two touchdown passes and helped rally the Stateliners to a 33-12 victory . \nLast Friday’s game at Hillsborough signified almost a complete role reversal. With the team in somewhat of a rut, Ringhoff was summoned from the sideline to take over for Fisher. \nRinghoff was outstanding. He completed 11 of 13 passes – one of the incompletions was a drop – for 180 yards including a pair of touchdowns to spark the Stateliners to a 28-21 victory . \n“The key thing is that everyone on the team understands it,” Ditze said. “It (platoon system) seems to be working right now. If it keeps working it could turn out to be pretty good for our football team.” \nYou can’t argue with success. So far P’burg has fashioned a 4-1 record, including three straight wins, with the only setback being a heartbreaking 31-28 loss to unbeaten Bridgewater on Sept. 12. \nThe Stateliners will go for their fourth straight victory on Friday night when they play another once-beaten team, Elizabeth, in a Mid-State 38 Conference Delaware Division battle at Maloney Stadium. \nRELATED : Phillipsburg's Robert Melise is a disruptive force on defense \nRinghoff was especially effective with his short passing game. He hit five different receivers during his first drive, which resulted in a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zach Troxell just before halftime. \n“Zach did a tremendous job moving the chains, especially before the end of the first half,” Ditze said. “It was a credit for him to be able to get us in the end zone. That gave us a little momentum.” \nAlthough Fisher took most of the snaps in the previous three games against Bridgewater, Watchung Hills and Franklin, Ditze says Fisher and Ringhoff have had an equal opportunity since the first day of practice. \nWe rotate them so that they each get an equal amount of reps in practice,” Ditze said. “I think Zach said it best when he said ‘You always have to be ready because you never know when you’re number is going to be called.”’ \nAs of Monday Ditze was uncertain whether Ringhoff or Fisher would start against Elizabeth. \n“We’ll decide later in the week,” he said. \nRinghoff’s passing efficiency was especially necessary because P’burg’s running game, which is generally the team’s strength, never really got untracked. The Stateliners managed just 77 yards on 41 carriers. \n“We’re (normally) a run-heavy team,” Ditze said, “but both of our quarterbacks are sound. They’re both effective out of our play-action passing. Zach gave us a lot of juice.” \nP’burg is becoming accustomed to playing in bad weather. Two weeks ago the game against Franklin (42-6 win) was played in a steady rain and the Hillsborough game was delayed an hour due to heavy rain and lightning. \nRobert Melise , P’burg’s junior two-way lineman, believes the inclement weather plays right into the Stateliners’ hands. \n“We actually like playing in the rain,” Melise said. “Coach (defensive coordinator Frank) Duffy says ‘Ignore the noises.’ I give Coach Duffy a lot of credit for that.” \nElizabeth (4-1) fell from the unbeaten ranks last week when it suffered a 20-14 loss to Bridgewater. Elizabeth led 14-10 at halftime. \n“I heard they’re a very explosive team,” Melise said on Monday. “That’s about all I know right now. I’ll see more of them on film as the week progresses.” \nThe Minutemen opened with a convincing 40-23 victory over Watchung Hills before posting narrow wins over Hunterdon Central (21-13), Franklin (14-12) and Union (10-7). \nElizabeth’s strength is its running back tandem of Jahmin Muse (344 yards, 4 TDs, 9.6 yards per carry) and Kyron Paige (333 yds, 5 TDs, 7.1 ypc). Muse also leads the team in receiving with 10 catches for 202 yards and 3 scores. \nThe rotating quarterback trio of seniors Ja’Quill Burch and Milton Hunter and junior Pernell Williams have combined to throw for 376 yards and 4 touchdowns against 1 interception. \n“It’s a typical Elizabeth team,” Ditze said. “They have some tremendous athletes who stretch the field both east-west and north-south. And this is one of the better defenses I’ve seen Elizabeth have. They’re never going to be short on talent down there.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
