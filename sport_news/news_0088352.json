It was a difficult loss for the home side as it blew late three-point leads in both the first and fourth sets. \nHowever, it was how the team battled back in the third set that impressed new head coach Beth Clark. ACC’s serve receive game broke down in the second set and put it down 2-0 in the match, but the Cougars came together to force a fourth set and jumped out to an early advantage in it. \n“They really dug deep,” said Clark. “They showed a lot of character and I thought they came together as a team and fought through it and I’m really proud of them.” \nClark was also happy to see the team come together a little more. The squad returned only two players from last season, although five of the nine on the roster are graduates from Elton Collegiate in Forrest. \nBrooke Huculak is one of them and will be a key cog for the Cougars. The former Brandon University Bobcat posted 19 kills and served three aces in the opener. The five-foot-10 police studies student has been away from the game for a couple years and loves being back on the court. \n“It feels awesome, especially since I thought I’d never be competing again,” she said. “It feels natural to be back on the court again. I feel lucky to have the opportunity again.” \nThe outside should be the strength for the Cougars this season with Kasie McLaughlin, who has also played hockey and soccer for ACC, joining Huculak on the left side and Erica Scott on the right. McLaughlin and Scott both had seven kills on Friday, with Scott adding three blocks. Setter Charley Maxwell chipped in with four aces. \nAlthough the Cougars have a small bench, the team has high expectations. \n“We definitely want to qualify for the championship,” Clark said. “These girls want to win. They’re ready and work hard every single day. That’s the goal.” \nThe Cougar men also have high hopes and head coach Joel Small would love to play for the championship. \nHis team is much larger with 14 players on the roster, which is half the amount that tried out in early September. Small likes the players he picked for the team and feels there’s a lot of depth there to carry the squad this winter. \nThe Cougars’ strength is “just our team game,” he said. “We play defence well as a team, we block well as a team. We don’t have one go-to player so I think we’ll have a dynamic offence and keep teams guessing the entire game. We have a deep bench as well so I’m confident whoever we put on the floor can put the ball away for us.” \nThe year didn’t start well­ for the Cougars as they fell 3-0 (25-18, 25-15, 25-15) to the Pilots in their season opener. Sam Isfeld paced ACC with five kills, an ace and two stuff blocks. \nRegardless of what happens in the regular season, the men’s team is assured a playoff spot as Saint Boniface has dropped out of the league, making it a four-team circuit. However, Small is focused on a better finish than just a post-season berth. \n“We’re looking to be competitive every game and get above .500 hopefully,” he said. “Maybe be top two going into playoffs and get that advantage a little bit being the top seed or something like that. \n“The league looks pretty close this year so we just want to be competitive.” \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:07:24.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
