LOUIS – Joe Maddon said Thursday and again before Friday’s division-series opener that he wasn’t going to run away from Pedro Strop.\nHe didn’t say anything about leaving him behind at the hotel Saturday. Or tripping him on his way to the mound. Or locking him in an equipment closet when the Cubs take the field for Game 2 at Busch Stadium.\nWhen Strop’s season-long troubles at Busch continued in Friday’s eighth inning, it only underscored how important it likely will be for the Cubs to find the right formula for taking care of late innings of close games – especially against a team with as much playoff experience and success as the Cardinals.\nEspecially with the heightened importance of every out created by losing the opener of a best-of-five series.\n“It becomes real big, absolutely,” said manager Joe Maddon, who made Strop his first name called from the bullpen this postseason, in Friday’s eighth.\n“The bullpen’s always huge, man. You win championships because your bullpen does a great job, and our guys are rested, and I have a ton of confidence in them.”\nWhether it would have made a difference Friday, Strop turned a 2-0 game into a 4-0 game within two pitches – giving up rookie Stephen Piscotty’s first postseason homer in his first postseason game.\nWhen the Cubs put runners at the corners in the ninth with two out against Trevor Rosenthal, it became a footnote instead of a critical moment in the game.\n“If that eighth inning goes a little bit different, we’ve got the go-ahead run at the plate off a really good closer,” said Cubs starter Jon Lester, who allowed only one run before allowing a one-out homer and walk in the eighth.\nUntil Strop took over, the Cubs’ pen hadn’t pitched since Sunday’s final game of the regular-season, so they’re more than rested.\nThey might be better off if Strop is considered unavailable in the series, at least until they get back home.\nStrop, who’s still looking for his first clean pitching line this season at Busch Stadium, has retired just eight Cardinals in six appearances in St. Louis this year – allowing eight hits, five walks and two hit batters in this 2 2/3 innings (27.00 ERA).\nEven before the game, he said he had no idea why he had so much trouble at Busch compared to everywhere else. His season 2.91 ERA drops to 2.05 if St. Louis games are removed.\n“I really don’t have anything specific. It could be confidence; whenever I struggle most of the time it’s been here,” he said. “But I never think about it. I’m going to try to do my best.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:09:15.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
