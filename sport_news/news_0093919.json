Walking, running and swimming are exercises everyone can do to maintain a healthful lifestyle,” said Dave Heywood, CEO of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Hawaii. \nFollowing the Dip-n-Dash, the Ironkids helped lead the Ironman Parade of Nations. \nThis is the fourth year UnitedHealthcare is supporting Ironkids as part of the company’s commitment to help stem the rising tide of childhood obesity through healthy lifestyles. \nObesity among children and adolescents has almost tripled since 1980, with nearly one in every three children being overweight or obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Children from low-income and low-education households are three-times more likely to suffer from obesity, which is a leading risk factor for diabetes, heart disease and many cancers, according to America’s Health Rankings, an annual comprehensive assessment of the nation’s health on a state-by-state basis. Nearly 22 percent of adults and 13 percent of children in Hawaii are estimated to be obese. Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
