(Chris Desmond/Special to The Commercial Appeal) Related Coverage Northpoint improves to 9-0; Central edges past Southwind (9) Northpoint 12, Harding 7\nNorthpoint football coach Greg Wallace didn't want to talk about being undefeated or about the region championship his team secured Friday night at Harding.\nInstead, Wallace's thoughts were on a well-deserved celebration.\n\"I just want to get a cheeseburger and lie down,\" Wallace laughed.\nBuy one for everyone on defense, coach.\nNorthpoint, ranked ninth in the The Commercial Appeal's Dandy Dozen, used a stout defensive effort against one of the area's most explosive groups of playmakers and defeated the host Lions 12-7.\nThe victory extends Northpoint's record to 9-0 but more importantly clinched the regular-season Division 2-A West Region championship and most likely home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\"I think we're a little faster on defense than what people give us credit for,\" said Wallace. \"It's senior-laden and it just makes plays.\"\nHarding (6-2, 2-1) got into the Northpoint red zone four times Friday but didn't score until Marquavious Moore punched it in from nine yards with 2:13 to go in the game.\nThat made it 12-7, but the Trojans' Reid Haberstroh pounced on an onside kick. Northpoint then picked up a first down on a Christian Saulsberry run and ran out the clock to put an exclamation point on the fourth game this season in which the Trojans have held their opponent to a touchdown or less.\n\"We're not the biggest or the strongest,\" said Wallace, whose team concludes the regular season against Fayette-Ware on Oct. 30. \"But we're mean and nasty.\"\nThe meanest and nastiest of all the Trojans was senior defensive end Tyree Bryant, a 6-2, 230-pounder who was in on seemingly every big play.\n\"He'll be a linebacker in college,\" said Wallace. \"But for us, he's just a chase-the-ball guy.\"\nNorthpoint got the only points of the first half when Saulsberry capped a 63-yard drive with a 13-yard run, his 19th touchdown of the season. Brock Waddel's extra point try failed, leaving the Trojans ahead 6-0.\nThat drive was set up by an interception by the Trojans' Jamison Patterson after the Lions had driven to the Northpoint 9-yard line.\nHarding put together another nice drive to open the third quarter, using a 27-yard pickup by Moore to reach the Trojans' 14. But Northpoint forced a four-and-out and then responded with an 86-yard drive that made it 12-0. Nelson Farbizius scored from 11 yards.\nAnd in the fourth quarter, Harding recovered a fumble after a huge hit by Keilan Hulton on Adam McPherson but came away scoreless once again after going four-and-out from the 15.\n\"Offensively, we didn't execute the way we wanted to,\" said Wallace. \"I think our backs were dancing too much. And they had a great game plan for us.\"", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/1017_MASP_harding_sat_05.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*144/1017_MASP_harding_sat_04.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*324/1017_MASP_harding_sat_06.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*151/1017_MASP_harding_sat_05.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/images/1017_MASP_harding_sat_04.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/images/1017_MASP_harding_sat_06.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-17T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:24:33.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
