SPECIAL Eric Curl The upcoming municipal election could lead to a new city manager for Savannah, depending on who is elected to the mayor’s seat.\nTwo mayoral candidates said they may replace City Manager Stephanie Cutter if they were elected, when asked whether they supported a reassessment of her role as the city’s top administrator during a forum at the Armstrong Center on Thursday night.\nEddie DeLoach said that the city manager has no long-term plan and that he would support such a review, adding that too much of the city’s problems are often attributed to lower-level employees.\n“Usually, if there is a problem, it starts at the top,” he said.\nMurray Silver offered a similar sentiment, stating that Cutter was “out of her depth.”\nA city manager should never have had to hire an outside agency to tell her what she already knows is wrong with the police department, Silver said.\n“And she still hasn’t fixed that,” he said.\nLouis Wilson said he would have to make an assessment as to whether Cutter was carrying out the council’s directives, but at this point he was inclined to have her remain since she was already so involved in carrying out city business.\nMayor Edna Jackson supported the job Cutter has done after taking the position after the forced resignation of former City Manager Rochelle Small-Toney in 2012.\n“I will continue working with Stephanie Cutter,” Jackson said. “She has earned the job.”\nCutter’s job performance was one of a number of topics raised during the two-hour forum that sought to raise new issues for candidates to address, in addition to crime.\nCandidates were also asked whether they supported amending the city charter to institute a strong mayoral form of government, which DeLoach, Jackson and Wilson said they opposed.\nSilver, who commonly addressed his remarks to the college students in attendance, said that the first thing he would do is institute term limits for aldermen.\n“Otherwise you are going to be looking at the same faces until your grandchildren are your age,” he said.\nAll the candidates supported food trucks in Savannah. In addition, all the candidates agreed the Savannah-Chatham police should have the ability to destroy confiscated guns, which they are currently prohibited from doing by state law.\nWhen asked whether they would support the police merger even if the county refused to pay a portion of the costs of officer salary increases recently implemented by the city, DeLoach said the current dispute was a result of the city having no plan and breaking the contract with the county. He said that the city should go ahead and approve the merger, even if they have to shoulder the costs themselves, with the possibility the county would chip in next year.\n“We need to keep that merger going,” he said.\nJackson said the county had rejected the city’s attempts to meet and consider the increases before they were implemented.\n“We did what we were supposed to do,” she said, adding that the police committee meeting was expected to meet next week to consider the issue.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14795495.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14795495.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:55:40.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
