Bone was the team’s leading scorer, averaging 15.3 points per game and pulling down six rebounds a contest.She played in 33 of the 34 games for the Sun. Bone will once again spend the winter playing in Turkey and continue to work on her game. “My thing would be staying consistent on the low block and improving on that as well as to consistently be a threat from the 15-to-17 foot mark,” Bone said after the final game of the season for the Sun. “From a mental standpoint, I have to realize that things go up and down in a long basketball season. I hit a roadblock this season when (the Connecticut) losses start to pile up. I have to remain steady throughout the entire season.” The 6-foot-4, 215-pound product of Texas A&M came to Connecticut as part of the trade that sent Tina Charles to the New York Liberty just prior to the 2014 WNBA draft.
