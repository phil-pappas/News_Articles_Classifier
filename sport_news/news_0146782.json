FILE PHOTO Related article » Traffic ticket amnesty program There is a one-time $50 amnesty program fee for each participant, and the Department of Motor Vehicles charges a $55 driver's license reinstatement fee.\nCalifornia Judicial Council: courts.ca.gov/trafficamnesty.htm\nRiverside County: riverside.courts.ca.gov/traffic/amnestyinfo.pdf\nSan Bernardino County: Information will be posted soon on the court's website, sb-court.org\nUnder an amnesty program that begins Thursday, Oct. 1, people with unpaid traffic tickets may be eligible to have the amount of money they owe reduced.\nGov. Jerry Brown pushed the program as a way to help those can’t afford to pay off spiraling traffic fines and have had their licenses suspended as a result. It will be in effect for 18 months, ending March 31, 2017.\nIn the Inland area, it may take a phone call, a written application or a visit to a courthouse to determine whether someone is eligible, and how much their debt will be reduced. Depending on income, they could have 50 or 80 percent knocked off their debt, if they meet the criteria for the amnesty.\nRELATED: Traffic ticket scofflaws, you're forgiven – now pay up\nThe program does not apply to parking tickets, reckless driving or DUI offenses. People otherwise eligible may be excluded if they owe victim restitution or have certain outstanding warrants.\nPeople with unpaid tickets whose fines were due by Jan. 1, 2013, and who did not pay it off in full as of Sept. 30 may be eligible for amnesty and have their driver’s license reinstated.\nOriginally, anyone who had paid off a delinquent fine after June 24, when the governor signed the amnesty bill, would not have qualified for the amnesty when it took effect. But on Wednesday, Brown signed another bill by Sen. Robert M. Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, that eliminated that issue.\nMore significantly, the new legislation helps other motorists by giving them the right to challenge many routine traffic tickets without having to first pay the contested fines, according to a news release from Hertzberg’s office.\nIn Riverside County, adult vehicle code misdemeanors are also eligible for the amnesty, with the exception of reckless driving and DUI offenses.\nIn San Bernardino County, no misdemeanors are included in the program, said Christina Volkers, court executive officer.\nPeople wishing to apply for the 50 percent amnesty for a Riverside County ticket may contact a Riverside County court directly, either in person or by phone, and an automated system will help determine if they are eligible. The phone number is 951-222-0384, with operators available from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, except court holidays.\nTo seek the 80 percent reduction based on income, people need to fill out an application on the Riverside County Superior Court website, riverside.courts.ca.gov, or in person.\nFor delinquent tickets in San Bernardino County, people must go to a courthouse to find out if they are eligible for amnesty. One clerk’s window will be designated to handle inquiries at each site, Volkers said.\nBoth Riverside and San Bernardino counties expect to handle inquiries with existing staff.\n“We are hoping to automate as much as possible to reduce any manual tasks,” Marita Ford, spokeswoman for the Riverside County courts, wrote in an email.\nVolkers served as chairwoman of the statewide working group, made up of court, county, city and other interested parties, that came up with the program.\n“We don’t know what to expect” in terms of volume of requests, she said.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9075 or gwesson@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvimo2-b88527538z.120150930172602000gokcatme.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvimo2-b88527538z.120150930172602000gokcatme.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:59:05.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
