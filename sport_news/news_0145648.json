Kuechly had spent the previous week inside the team facilities rather than out on the field with his teammates. \nPanthers coach Ron Rivera wasn’t sure when Kuechly was set to meet with the doctor, but it will happen before the team returns from its bye week on Tuesday. \n“It’ll happen with the whole intention of getting him on the practice field Tuesday,” Rivera said. “And if he’s not then he’ll continue in the protocol.” \nThe independent doctor did not pass Kuechly more than a week ago when they met after optimism had been previously voiced by Rivera. \nThe Panthers have played 14 of their 16 quarters this season without their middle linebacker. \nFilling in for Kuechly has been A.J. Klein, who missed practice Wednesday because of illness. The Panthers have gotten good play out of their linebacker group without Kuechly, and they’ll want to ease him back into the fold rather than throwing him out there next week against the Seahawks. \nKuechly likely wouldn’t play his usual 100-percent of snaps against Seattle because his conditioning would be down, as well as the Panthers wanting to get playing time for the likes of Klein and Shaq Thompson. \n“He’s only done so much,” Rivera said of Kuechly. “And I think also, in all fairness to the rest of the group of guys, you don’t want to put him out there right away and go 100 percent of the snaps when you can avoid it. That’s one of the things we want to do. We don’t want the guy to get hurt again or get winded and get himself in a bad position.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:44:19.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
