After a disappointing extra-inning loss in the Class S softball state semifinals two days earlier, Pinckneyville District #204 rebounded and finished their season with a victory, winning the third place game with Century 6-2 on Thursday in Coulterville. Century grabbed a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning after two errors and three hits, but in the top of the second, the Lady Tigers' offense showed up. Olivia Buza started things off with a base hit, then Cheyenne Pauley drove her in with an RBI single with one out. With two outs, Taylor Kurtz walked, Anna Pestka singled, Megan Engelhardt walked, and Aubrey Bruns had a base hit to cap off a five-run inning for #204. Three Century errors helped keep the rally going. Century failed to record a hit the rest of the way while the Lady Tigers added an insurance run in the top of the seventh. Pestka (1-4, 2 R), Engelhardt (1-2, R, BB, HBP), Bruns (1-4), Buza (1-3, R) and Pauley (1-3, R, RBI) had Pinckneyville's hits.
