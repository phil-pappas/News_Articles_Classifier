Apparently, people in London only use one-ply TP, so the Jets decided to bless their players and staff with two-ply TP this week by bringing it themselves. And earlier today after practice, linebacker Calvin Pace went as far as to say that the Jets are “the best organization in football” because of it.\n“We’re the best organization in football, man,” he told the New York Daily News . “Sometimes, you guys write articles about us that don’t say that. But this place, they’ll do something for you. I mean, who brings toilet paper? Little things like that make your trip easier. If it’s a good thing for us, if it helps us win, I’m all for it.”\nPace admitted that he hasn’t actually used the two-ply TP yet—TMI?—but he was looking forward to enjoying one of the many comforts of home when he got back to the team hotel.\n“At least I know I’ll have some familiar toilet paper,” he said.\nIt is the little things, right? The Jets may have gotten a lot of things wrong over the last few decades, but they apparently got this right.\n New York Daily News ]", "external_links": ["https://www.sports.yahoo.com/news/jets-bring-350-rolls-toilet-185714941.html", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/calvin-pace-loves-jets-packing-toilet-paper-article-1.2382917"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:25:53.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
