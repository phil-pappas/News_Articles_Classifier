McKenna LeVitt from Reno won the girls title. \nIn boys singles, three players from Damonte Ranch earned a trip to the state tournament later this week in Las Vegas. \nZagar beat teammate Natale Castelli, 6-1, 6-1 in the final. No. 2 seeded Damonte freshman Zeke Brooke beat C.J. Hess from Galena, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1, to get the third slot. \nLeVitt, the top seed, beat second-seeded Madelyn Landerfelt of Douglas, 6-2, 6-4, in a hard-fought match to defend her title. Then, No. 14 seed Brittany Leonard, a junior at Bishop Manogue, beat No. 4 seed Lauren Kreutzer, a freshman at Spanish Springs, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3, to get the North’s third spot. \nLeVitt said her match with Landerfelt was tense. \n“She played really, really well. That set me up perfectly for state,” LeVitt said. “I needed that tough match.” \nLeVitt beat Kreutzer in the semifinals, 6-2, 6-2. In the other girls semi, Landerfelt beat Leonard, 6-0, 6-1. \nThe semifinals and finals were postponed from Saturday, due to rain. LeVitt said the extra wait was nerve-wracking. \n“I was really prepared Saturday. Mentally ready to go,” she said. “I had to re-set and re-focus myself. But it was good. It forced me to play when I wasn’t feeling 100 percent.” \nFor Leonard, the past week was a matter of playing her best tennis at the right time. \n“I worked as hard as I possibly could and it just paid off,” she said. “It was definitely a dream to go to state and I just went in with a goal to work my hardest and do the best I possibly could and it worked for me.” \nZagar, a junior who is home-schooled, could not play tennis last year due to a hip injury. He went 25-0 in singles and doubles this year in the regular season. \n“It feels good to win, but I had to play against my teammate and friend,” Zagar said. \nIn boys doubles, top seeds Ian Rinehart and Riley Boyden from Reno beat teammates Ben Vincze and Cameron Young, 6-2, 6-3. Marlin Brucato and Daulton O’Connell from Spanish Springs beat Damonte Ranch’s Andrew Luu and Blake Orton, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, to earn the third spot at state. \n“They played well and they’re getting better each time we play,” Reno coach Craig Gorbach said of his two doubles teams. “They need to just relax and play. If they relax, it will work out much better for them.” \nReno’s boys doubles teams have placed second at state the past three years. \nIn girls doubles, top seeds Kayleigh Carlson and Anne Pomeroy from Douglas beat Rose Berry and Halle Turek from Bishop Manogue, 6-1, 6-0. In the third-place match, Tara Cottrill and Kylie Coziahr from Douglas beat Kaitlyn Smith and Terra Williams, also from Douglas, 6-4, 6-4. \nNIAA STATE TOURNAMENT \nAt Darling Tennis Center, Las Vegas \nThursday : Team semifinals. \nFriday : Division I team finals, 8 a.m; individual quarterfinals, 5:30 p.m. Division I-A, 3 p.m. \nSaturday : Division I individual semifinals, 8 a.m., finals at noon.
