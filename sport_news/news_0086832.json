Here's what you need to know about the Week 5 meeting:\nINACTIVES\nOut for the Broncos: Left tackle Ty Sambrailo, receiver Cody Latimer, guard Shelley Smith, defensive end Kenny Anunike, cornerback Lorenzo Doss, quarterback Trevor Siemian and linebacker Lerentee McCray.\nSambrailo is still dealing with a shoulder injury. He was ruled out Friday, along with Latimer, who sustained a groin injury in the win over Minnesota last Sunday.\nOut for the Raiders: cornerback Dexter McDonald, running back Taiwan Jones, offensive linemen Jon Feliciano and Matt McCants, defensive linemen Justin Ellis and Denico Autry, and wide receiver Rod Streater.\nTOP STORYLINES\nDel Rio Reunion. The faces are (mostly) the same, but this isn't the defense Jack Del Rio left behind when he was hired by the Raiders in January. His 4-3 is out, replaced by Wade Phillips' 3-4 that has resulted in a league-high 18 sacks and a league-low 275.5 net yards allowed per game.\nAdvertisement Phillips' system has brought the best out of a roster that featured five Pro Bowlers last season. DeMarcus Ware has been swarming opposing quarterbacks, recording 12 quarterback hits and 4.5 sacks in four games. The Broncos' secondary has turned in two game-winning scores — a go-ahead pick-six by Aqib Talib in Week 1 and a scoop-and-score fumble recovery by Bradley Roby in Week 2. T.J. Ward's two sacks against the Vikings last Sunday set the tone for the defense, then secured the victory.\nAnd now they get to face Del Rio, whose final game on the Broncos' sideline was the playoff loss to Indianapolis. Yes, that one. The one where Chris Harris was inexplicably NOT covering Colts slot receiver T.Y. Hilton . (Hilton finished with four catches for 72 yards and drew two penalties on Aqib Talib.)\nThe Broncos' season ended with a whimper when GM John Elway wanted fire. He's gotten it so far, with the reinvigorated defense.\nThe players said this week that Del Rio was not their focus heading into Oakland. But it may be for millions still trying to get over that loss.\nPeyton Manning (18) of the Denver Broncos talks in the huddle in the fourth quarter. The Denver Broncos played the Minnesota Vikings at Sports Authority Field at Mile High in Denver, CO on October 4, 2015. ( Joe Amon, The Denver Post ) Return of Wolfe. Defensive end Derek Wolfe was vigilant with his training and game preparation while away from the Broncos' facilities the last four weeks. And it paid off. The Broncos re-activated Wolfe following his suspension for violating the league's performance-enhancement drug policy, and he is expected to play around 35 snaps Sunday.\nThe Broncos have held opponents to only 96.3 yards per game on the ground with Antonio Smith and Vance Walker rotating in during Wolfe's absence. His return should, theoretically, only make the Broncos' defense better.\n\"Out of the sacks I've gotten, I probably had 35 of them with Derek helping me out on the inside,\" outside linebacker Von Miller said. \"I think Derek will help us out in the pass game, the rush game. It'll just be great to get him back. He's probably the best in the run game in the AFC West, so having him back will be a big-time help for us.\"\nWolfe started all 16 games last season and the Broncos allowed the second-fewest rushing yards per game (79.3).\nHe participated in training camp and played in three of the four preseason games this year, so he's not new to the coaches or their systems. But Sunday will be his first in the 3-4, a scheme that better suits his size and speed on the line.\nO-Line Dance. Another game, another offensive line shuffle. The Broncos' depleted and youthful offensive line will move around again Sunday, coach Gary Kubiak said. Starting left tackle Ty Sambrailo is out for the second consecutive game because of a shoulder injury he sustained in Week 3.\nAgainst Minnesota last Sunday, Ryan Harris moved from right tackle to left, and Michael Schofield manned the right side. And despite early concerns, the line was efficient:. Manning was sacked twice (not three or four times), and the running backs found their holes, for 144 net rushing yards and a touchdown.\nBut Harris has soreness in his knee, left guard Evan Mathis has been dealing with a hamstring issue and right guard Louis Vasquez has had knee pain. The solution, Kubiak believes, is to rotate players in. Tyler Polumbus, recently signed after the Falcons let him go, and rookie Max Garcia, will spell the starters to limit their snaps.\n\"I think that we need to rotate some guys,\" Kubiak said Friday. \"I think we do. We have some veteran players like Ryan who are a little beat up right now this early in the season and I think that it will make us a better team if our young players continue to contribute. They're not playing 75 snaps per week, so I think that it's up to us to find a way to do that.\"\nAnderson watch. Ronnie Hillman's 72-yard touchdown run last Sunday gave the Broncos' ground game a needed boost. He and C.J. Anderson combined for 146 yards on 22 carries (11 apiece).\nMore moves to the O-Line make the challenge greater, but the onus is on Anderson this week.\nOakland is where his breakout season began in 2014 (90 rushing yards on 13 carries), but he hasn't looked like the same this season in Kubiak's zone-blocking system. Not yet, anyway.\nWhile Kubiak seemed pleased with the run game after Week 4, he has not-so-subtly pressured his backs to step up more.\n\"Everybody wants to get 100 yards, catch 10 balls and have five sacks, but the other team plays, too,\" Kubiak said Thursday. \"You've got to stay focused on your job. If it's not going well, be man enough and committed enough to make it better. When it is going good, you probably shouldn't listen very much and just keep going. That's part of being a pro.\"\nHOW TO WATCH\nSunday, Oct. 11, 2:25 p.m.\nO.co Coliseum, Oakland, Calif.\nTV: CBS — Greg Gumbel, play-by-play; Trent Green, color\nNational Radio: Sports USA Radio -- Bob Fitzgerald, play-by-play; Jake Plummer, color\nLocal Radio: KOA (850 AM); The Fox (104.3 FM)\nSERIES HISTORY\nMeetings: 109\nBroncos' record: 48-59-2 (Home: 24-28-2; Away: 24-31-0)\nCurrent Broncos' streak: Won the last seven meetings, stretching back to Nov. 6, 2011\nLast meeting at Oakland: Nov. 9, 2014: Broncos 41, Raiders 17\nManning, who has won his last nine meetings with the Raiders, boasts a 68.8 completion percentage (278-of-404), with averages of 287 yards and 2.5 touchdowns per game, and a 103.8 passer rating in 11 games against Oakland.
