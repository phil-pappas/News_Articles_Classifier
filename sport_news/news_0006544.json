Especially when you are trying to break up a shutout and avoid your most lopsided loss since 2005. On a third-and-goal from Ohio State's 4-yard-line, quarterback Hayden Rettig zipped a pass into a tight window to Andre Patton for a touchdown. Rettig's best attribute as a quarterback is his arm strength, and it was on display on this play.\nWORST PLAY\nWith High Point Solutions Stadium still abuzz from an exciting build-up to kickoff, Rutgers put together its best drive of the game on its opening possession. A 25-yard run by Paul James, an 18-yard catch by Leonte Carroo and a fourth-and-1 quarterback sneak conversion by Chris Laviano resulted in first downs on a 12-play, 64-yard drive. It was a perfectly scripted start â€” even with settling for a field goal. Except that inconsistent kicker Kyle Federico, who drilled a 26-yard walk-off field goal to beat Indiana last week, clanged his 29-yard kick off the left upright. No good.
