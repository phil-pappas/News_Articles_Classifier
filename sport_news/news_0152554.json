Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch missed the team’s victory over the Detroit Lions on Monday night, but head coach Pete Carroll is optimistic Beast Mode will return to action in Week 5.\nAdChoices Following the win over the Detroit Lions, Carroll revealed the team held out Lynch to avoid a setback for Week 5. Per the Seahawks official site, Carroll said:\n“He wasn’t quite right, His best day was [Monday]. He ran pretty well in pregame, but they did not think he could sustain through the game and come out healthy again the next week. So we’re hoping that by using patience here, that he’ll be ready to go this next week.”\nLynch sat out because of a hamstring injury, which often linger unless given proper time to rest. Considering his production has dropped steadily since the season opener, it was a smart decision.\nDuring the first three games, Lynch tallied 73, 41 and 14 rushing yards, adding 31, 21 and nine receiving yards, respectively. Plus, if there were ever a game for Lynch to sit, it was Detroit.\nThe Lions have a stellar defense, evidenced by the six sacks and holding the Seahawks to 3.5 yards per carry. Lynch would’ve taken a beating that, as Carroll suggested, probably would’ve affected his Week 5 availability.\nSeattle is preparing for a showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals, who haven’t allowed a rushing touchdown all season. The Seahawks will need Lynch at full strength for what should be a battle.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.seahawks.com/news/2015/10/05/seahawks-hope-marshawn-lynch-will-be-%E2%80%9Cready-go%E2%80%9D-next-week-and-other-injury-updates", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:43:39.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
