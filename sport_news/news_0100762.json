Jay Beagle tied the game at 2 not quite 6 minutes into the final stanza, and Alex Ovechkin, the Great 8, scored his fifth of the season with just under 5 minutes to play to give the Caps (5-1-0, 10) their first win in Vancouver since March 28, 1998. Beagle’s goal was a weird one. Canuck Radim Vrbata made an ill-advised drop apss behind his own goal that was stolen by Marcus Johansson. Johansson sent the puck back to center point for John Carlson, who lobbed one toward Vancouver goalie Ryan Miller. Miller made the initial save, but the puck popped into the air, trickled off his back and in. Somewhere along the way, Beagle apparently tipped it, whether it was before it got to Miller, or on the way down. Even watching the replay in slo-motion it’s hard to tell, but the goal was indeed awarded to Beagle, his first of the season. Then at the 15:05 mark, Dmitry Orlov made stretch pass from behind his own net to the opposite blue line for Evgeny Kuznetsov. Kuznetsov then found Ovechkin gliding on the left wing and fed him perfectly at the top of the circle on a two-on-one. Ovechkin then did what he does better than anyone, and blasted a slap shot past Miller for the game-winner. The goal gives the Captain his 480th of his illustrious career, just three shy of former teammate Sergei Federov’s record of 483 for first place among Russian-born players in career NHL goals. Jason Chimera started the scoring in this one. Good defense sprung Beagle for a rush along the right wing, and his centering pass found Chimera’s tape at the far post for an easy tap-in. Vrbata’s wrap-around goal evened it at 4:14 of the second, and Henrik Sedin’s power play marker made it 2-1 midway through the second period. Braden Holtby made 23 saves to register the win. \nNEXT GAME : Friday night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern against the Edmonton Oilers. Philipp Grubauer is expected to start for the first time this season.
