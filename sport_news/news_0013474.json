Despite calling off their “rail roko” agitation, farmers have decided to gherao state ministers and MPs across the state. Farmer leaders said though they had ended their “rail roko” agitation, the protest would continue as the government hadn’t conceded to any of their main demands so far. “While the Faridkot fiasco kept the police busy due to tension over Guru Granth Sahib’s sacrilege, we will be back with our protests as soon as the situation becomes normal,” they said. Sources said farmers planned to stop and gherao ministers travelling by road to their constituencies or official functions. “The point is to hoodwink the police and ministers so that we are able to ensure that we are heard on the spot and our complaints reach the minister directly. There is no point waiting to round up the minister when the police comes to their rescue and they manage to give the agitating farmers the slip,” they said. “We would prevent BJP and Akali MLAs and MPs from entering their respective constituencies. Residences of all ministers will also be gheraoed on October 23. We will try to ensure that the ministers travelling by road faced the same fate as lakhs of railway commuters did during the rail roko agitation,” said Buta Burajgill, state president the Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda). “The ministers have already started skipping functions organised in villages as they know the farmers would not spare them,” he stated. A Cabinet minister confirmed they were avoiding visiting grain markets and attending various functions as farmers were angry with the government. “The past few days have not been going good for the state,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:17:54.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
