He has spent the entire offseason packing on some extra pounds in order to make his legs stronger so that he doesn’t spend another season dealing with injuries . That’s not the only change he’s made, either. According to his Grizzlies teammate Tony Allen , Conley has also switched up his pre-game music.\n“He stopped listening to Usher ,” Allen told the Commercial Appeal , “and he’s listening to 2Pac , Future …He’s turnt up now, so his whole preparation before the game is seek and destroy now. I like that ambition about him.”\nWill 2Pac and Future really make that much of a difference, though? Well, if it’s good for LeBron , it’s probably good for the rest of the league, no? Stay tuned to see how Conley looks at the start of the season.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com .\n[ via Commercial Appeal ]", "external_links": ["http://www.commercialappeal.com/sports/grizzlies/free-agent-to-be-conley-stronger-more-valuable-than-ever-20c5f184-5df1-663a-e053-0100007fe1c4-330183081.html"], "published": "2015-10-01T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:26:18.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
