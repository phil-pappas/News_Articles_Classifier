Odell Beckham Jr. already had shut up his critics with his performance on the field. \nHe had seven catches for 134 yards and a touchdown. The touchdown came in the third quarter on a ridiculous change-of-direction move that nearly brought 49ers cornerback Kenneth Acker to his knees. \nThen Beckham celebrated with a ridiculous, gyration-filled dance in the end zone. It was part salsa, part hit dem folks (and no, I have no idea what that means), and all stupid. I have no problem with players celebrating. But if they celebrate to the point that they hurt something in the process? \nWell, that's just stupid. And it sure appears that's what happened Sunday night at MetLife Stadium, even if Beckham denied that after the game. He said the injury happened five or six plays before the touchdown, but after his dance, he was seen stretching with a trainer and jogging back and forth as if trying to prove that he was good to go back into the game. \nHe did not go back until there were 45 seconds left, missing an entire series, and he's lucky that Eli Manning pulled this out with one of his best fourth-quarter comebacks. The Giants won, 30-27, in dramatic fashion to take a one-game lead in the NFC East. \nMORE: Beckham close to tears in postgame interview after win \nBeckham should breath a sigh of relief, because the focus would have all been on him if not for Manning's dramatics. Beckham, the football player, is practically unassailable — and still, somehow it happened twice last week. \nFirst, it was Bills cornerback Stephon Gilmore insisting that Beckham was a prima donna whose \"world is based on hype and that one catch.\" \nThen it was Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie, declaring that \"right now (Beckham) is a one-year wonder.\" \nCromartie, in fairness, was on TV, and the only way current NFL players get more TV gigs is to say something inflammatory. Here is the full quote: \n\"I'm just being honest. It's just one year,\" Cromartie told ESPN . \"I need to see it on an every-game basis, not him getting penalties or something like that or sucker-punching somebody. I think it's all about how you carry yourself throughout your whole entire career.\" \nUh, Cro? If he is a one-year wonder, it's one of the best one years in NFL history. In his first 16 games (stretching over two seasons), Beckham had 115 catches for 1,612 yards and 14 touchdowns. Compare that to any Hall of Fame receiver, and the edge goes to the Giants receiver. \nWhich is why you hope that Beckham learned from what happened on Sunday night and ... \n1. Stops being a side show. He doesn't need to be flashy after he scores. He's a marvel to watch when he's just doing what he does as good or better than nearly every receiver in the league. \nHe's going to get the endorsements without the performances. All he has to do is keep playing at this level and stay healthy, and if dancing keeps him off the field, then he not only hurts his production but his reputation. \n2. The injuries might be too much for this defense to overcome. When middle linebacker Jon Beason left the game with a concussion, the Giants were missing three of the four starting linebackers. That's in addition to defensive ends Robert Ayers Jr. and George Selvie. \nThe unit played well in the first half, but the way the 49ers — the 30th-ranked offense in the NFL — marched down the field for the go-ahead score in the fourth quarter was telling. The Giants already were undermanned. Their depth isn't good enough to handle losses like this. RELATED: Odell Beckham Jr. can't save the Giants season on his own \n3. Eli Manning had a statistical masterpiece. Well, if you were a fantasy football owner with Manning on your team, you were tickled. This was one of the best games, statistically, in his career. He exceeded 400 yards passing for just the seventh time, completing 41 of 54 passes for 441 yards. \nIn a word: Wow. (Even with the end zone interception before the end of the first half.) \n4. Is Andre Williams out of the running back rotation? The Giants all but abandoned the run in this game, but before they did, it sure looks like Andre Williams is playing himself out of the running back rotation. \nWilliams was snuffed on a curious play call on third-and-one from the San Francisco 3-yard line in the first quarter, and then ineffective again in a goal line situation in the second. With Rashad Jennings showing more pop and Shane Vereen having success as a change-of-pace back, the plodding Williams is averaging 3.2 yards or fewer in four out of five games this season. RELATED: Is Tom Coughlin having fun coaching the Giants? \n5. The NFC East is officially a tire fire. Will 7-9 win this division? Probably not, but the best thing the first-place Giants have going for them right now is their competition for the NFC East. The Cowboys look lost, predictably, without Tony Romo -- getting smoked, 30-6, at home by the Patriots. The Redskins lost in perfect Redskinesque way, with Kirk Cousins throwing a Pick Six in overtime. \nThe Eagles at least showed some signs of life, rolling past the Saints, but they needed that one just to avoid a week of Chip Kelly-to-USC rumors. All three teams are 2-3, and it sure seems clear that this, uh, battle for the division title will go to the final weeks of the season. \nSteve Politi may be reached at spoliti@njadvancemedia.com .
