Catholic star, already took his first official visit to Michigan three weeks ago , where he was hosted by New Jersey's former top player Jabrill Peppers, as well as former Paladins star Juwann Bushell-Beatty and Tyrone Wheatley, Jr., from Canisius (Manlius, N.Y.). \nAnd he came away from that visit with a high opinion of the program, his mother Jennifer coney revealed back then. \n\"When we got back to Detroit, there were so many people from Michigan, because they all wear the Michigan gear. But when we got on the plane, it was all Michigan, again. Everybody,\" said Coney. \"I was like, 'Oh my God.' And then when we landed in Newark, it was like I was in Detroit. That's how many people from Michigan live here, so many alumni. And that one made me think twice.\" \nGary is also slated to take an official visit to Auburn the weekend of the Iron Bowl against Alabama, where he'll experience the environment of one of the most heated rivalries in college football. \nBoth teams are recruiting Gary and are considered two of the top 10 teams on his radar. \nBut what about the rest? \n\"Im trying to set one up for LSU and USC,\" said Gary. \"Those are in the works right now.\" \nAnd who might that fifth team be? \n\"I dont know. It's gonna be a tough one,\" he said. \"Maybe Clemson. I don't even know. There are a couple schools in the running for that last one.\" \nRELATED: Where does Rutgers stand with Rashan Gary, the country's top player, following his Michigan State game visit? \nDespite a slow start to the season, the Paladins got back to a .500 record (3-3) after a 55-22 win over Friendship Academy in Maryland Saturday. \nStatistically, Gary has had a fruitful year, accumulating 45 tackles, 10 1/2 sacks and 10 additional tackles for loss in six games. But his productivity has increased as the season's progressed, in part due to a move to nose guard/ defensive tackle. \n\"I'm actually happy about the change because in the beginning of the season, when I was at defensive end, a lot of teams just ran away from me. I wasn't able to make as many plays as I am now. I had to chase down plays. But now I'm in the middle so, you know, it's equal playing field for me. So you know I'm just happy to move around because teams can scout me, but they really can't.\" \nGary, a five-star recruit, hopes to make his collegiate announcement at the Under Armour All-American Game in January, but could decide later than that if he hasn't made up his mind by then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:58:13.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
