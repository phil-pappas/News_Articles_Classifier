Watt operating against a mediocre offensive line. \n\"I would say Andrew Luck will play in the game, so we will prepare for him,\" Texans coach Bill O'Brien said. \nWhether he plays or not, the Texans will end Indy's impressive streak. \nTEXANS, 24-20 \n___ \nKNOCKOUT LEAGUE TIP: \nSAN DIEGO made it too tight for comfort last week, but survived. Lots of potential choices this week (New England, Atlanta, Green Bay, Kansas City). Our suggestion: NEW YORK GIANTS. \nNo. 1 New England (minus 7 1-2) at No. 15 Dallas \nThe Cowboys might be too banged up to handle Boston College, let alone the Patriots. \nBEST BET: PATRIOTS, 33-17 \nNo. 30 Jacksonville (plus 3) at No. 32 Tampa Bay \nSkirmish in the Sunshine State? More like a finger fight, but we think Jaguars are better team. \nUPSET SPECIAL: JAGUARS, 17-16 \nNo. 8 Seattle (plus 1 1-2) at No. 5 Cincinnati \nJust don't like what we're seeing from the Seahawks. \nBENGALS, 22-16 \nNo. 10 St. Louis (plus 9) at No. 2 Green Bay \nPackers remain unbeaten, but Aaron Rodgers goes down a few times. \nPACKERS, 27-17 \nNo. 21 Washington (plus 7 1-2) at No. 4 Atlanta \nFalcons remain unbeaten, Matt Ryan and Julio Jones have another big day. \nFALCONS, 31-20 \nNo. 3 Denver (minus 5 1-2) at No. 19 Oakland \nBroncos remain unbeaten despite spotty offense thanks to big-play defense. \nBRONCOS, 24-13 \nNo. 7 Arizona (minus 3) at No. 27 Detroit \nLions in danger of imploding, Cardinals have protection issues. \nCARDINALS, 26-21 \nNo. 25 Cleveland (plus 6 1-2) at No. 18 Baltimore \nBrowns will do as always, make it close and lose in the end. \nRAVENS, 20-17 \nNo. 31 San Francisco (plus 7) at No. 12 New York Giants \nRevitalized Giants against reeling 49ers. \nGIANTS, 27-14 \nNo. 11 Pittsburgh (plus 3) at No. 16 San Diego, Monday night \nWith Big Ben, an ideal Upset Special. With Mike Vick ... \nCHARGERS, 21-20 \nNo. 26 Chicago (plus 9) at No. 20 Kansas City \nBears found way to win, Chiefs really are struggling. Still ... \nCHIEFS, 23-17 \nNo. 14 Buffalo (minus 3) at No. 23 Tennessee \nBills are on every-other-week ride.
