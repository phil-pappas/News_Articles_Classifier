Today they will head east on I-10 to take on the two-time defending Class 5A state champion Acadiana Wreckin’ Rams at 7 p.m. at Bill Dotson Stadium. The veer machine There is nothing secret about what the Acadiana Wreckin’ Rams to do. Their split back veer offense has won four state championship since 2006 including the last two. Jayrin Wilson (82-780 yards, 9TD) and Ziggy Francis (83-566 yards, 6TD) have combined for nearly 1,400 yards. “It is a great challenge, you are talking about the defending state champs,” Eggleston said. “They know how to win and they are playing at their place. “We take that as a challenge. They do everything well. Their special teams is great. They are well coached. Their offense is a well-oiled machine and they are very physical on defense. They do a great job at everything they do.” Close games Sam Houston is coming off a three-point loss to rival Barbe for the second consecutive season. This week they have a chance to avenge a three-point loss to the Rams last year. In that game, the Broncos were driving for the winning score when quarterback Dustin Duhon fumbled the ball and linebacker Kevin Moore scooped it up and returned it 87 yards to give the Rams a 28-21 win. Eggleston is hoping to take some of the lessons learned from last week’s game in which they rallied for 42 second half points. “We let that one slip away last year,” Eggleston said. “This is a good opportunity and our kids are excited for it. “Obviously if we take care of business, take care of the ball the outcome will perhaps be better. We have some things that we can feed off of this week. Our guys are focused in.” Spread the ball around Senior tailback Trevantai Thompson is obviously the key cog in the Broncos’ offense with 1,329 yards and 17 touchdowns but Sam Houston has been trying bring more options into the game. When Thompson breaks 180 yards and quarterback Devante Deboest (93-384 yards, 5TD/38-95-2, 425 yards, TD) and slot receiver Drew Ardoin (26-252 yards, 2TD/9 rec., 99 yards, TD) rush for at least 40 yards each, Sam Houston is 2-1. The lone loss was last week by three points to the Barbe Bucs. “You have to do that,” Eggleston said. “Those are the things that we did well in the second half last. “Dustin Jackson caught a long pass, Devante ran for some big plays and Drew Ardoin had some big plays. It is stuff that we have to do because it makes it difficult if you don’t.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:08:16.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
