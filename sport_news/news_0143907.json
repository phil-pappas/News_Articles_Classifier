An alarm sounded loud and insistent from the cockpit as the plane flew level at 1,000 feet.\nA passenger strapped into metal benches that once carried paratroopers watched Commemorative Air Force pilot Richard Hammerschlag and co-pilot Gevin Harrison work the controls and half-waited for the disaster-movie dialogue, “Mayday! Mayday! We’re going down!”\nThe plane kept flying and the alarm stopped. Soon after, the gear warning horn went off again when Harrison pointed the plane’s nose down.\nSmiling, flight crew chief Andy Conley turned from where he was strapped in behind the pilots, gave a thumbs-up and mouthed, “We’re OK” above the engine noise.\nHarrison dropped the plane onto the runway. The sham emergency was part of the tests Hammerschlag, an airline transport pilot who once flew for the U.S. Postal Service, was putting Harrison through during his annual pilot proficiency check.\n“When we do the training, we simulate an engine out,” Conley said. “All twin-engine pilots are required to perform it.”\nThe Inland Empire Wing of the Commemorative Air Force, a volunteer group that restores and flies old warbirds, got the plane back in the air after raising roughly $60,000, mostly from members, for engine work and routine maintenance.\n“When it’s 70 years old, restoration never stops,” said Conley, the group’s operations officer.\nThey’re taking the C-53D Skytrooper to the Miramar Air Show in San Diego today. Crowds will get an up-close look at the olive-green plane, decked out with a parachute-wearing brunette pin-up and the name “D-Day Doll” on its nose.\nThe plane is believed to have made three combat air drops on D-Day, June 6, 1944, but records aren’t complete.\nThe group named it the D-Day Doll after the plane was donated in 2001.\nInland residents can also see the plane from noon to 8 p.m. Oct. 17 during a Return to Flight open house and fundraiser at Riverside Municipal Airport.\nThe free event at the group’s hangar, 6936 Flight Road, includes an F-16 flight simulator, kid’s zone, silent auction, music, food and drinks.\nThe group is raising money to renovate its main meeting room and build moveable displays.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviix6-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccar7p.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviix6-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccar59.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviix6-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccar7p.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviix6-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccar5i.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviix5-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccara6.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviix5-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccara4.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviix7-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccar56.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviix5-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccara4.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviix6-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccar5i.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviix7-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccar56.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviix5-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccara6.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviix6-b88526403z.120150930160530000g0ccar59.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:03:50.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
