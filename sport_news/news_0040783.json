(AP Photo/Mark Zaleski) \nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Buffalo Bills safety Aaron Williams will miss at least eight weeks because of a neck injury after being placed on the reserve-injured designated to return list. \nIn making the move Wednesday, the Bills also signed free agent safety Josh Bush. Under NFL rules, Williams can return to practice in six weeks, and be eligible to play two weeks later. \nWilliams missed two games after hurting his neck in a 40-32 loss to New England on Sept. 20. He briefly lost feeling in the left side of his body and was driven off the field by ambulance and taken to the hospital. \nWilliams returned last weekend, but missed a few snaps after appearing to aggravate the injury in a 14-31 win at Tennessee. \nBuffalo (3-2) hosts Cincinnati (5-0) on Sunday. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:27:48.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
