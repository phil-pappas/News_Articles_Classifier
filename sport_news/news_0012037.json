The potential exists for a paradox relating to recreational running and joint health: promoting running may have unknown consequences for knee joint health, conversely, discouraging physical activity will negatively impact overall health, increasing the burden on healthcare systems. Additionally, risks (and/or benefits) associated with recreational running may not remain static but vary throughout life. Much remains unknown and the running research base to inform clinical decision-making is thin. We aim to highlight the limitations of the current body of research and stimulate a wider debate regarding how this evidence is interpreted and conveyed. We also provide guidance on how future research should be structured and implemented to produce more robust science.
