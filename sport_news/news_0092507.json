The Captain likes what he's seen from this group and has been impressed with rookie Kristaps Porzingis.\nReed said the 7-foot-3 Porzingis has to get stronger, but he has a chance to be good.\nLatest Knicks stories Knicks playing it safe with Porzingis' knee Porzingis sits with sore left knee Melo: Knicks are competing for a championship Robin Lopez brings aggressive attitude to Knicks Melo bullish on Porzingis' attitude, game \"He's got skills,\" Reed said. \"Most guys [his size are] clumsy, unskillful - he's real well coordinated. He's got to get stronger, learn the game, but he's got very good skills. Now it's a matter of him learning how to play our game. I think he can do something that most guys his size don't do well and that's shoot the ball.\"\nReed attended last's year camp. From what he's seen thus far, he thinks the Knicks have better chemistry than last year's team and that the players are working hard, trying to earn spots. Reed said other than Carmelo Anthony, no one is guaranteed to start and that's led to some healthy competition.\n\"I really believe that we're going to have a great improvement in our performance this year on the court,\" Reed said. \"I just think the chemistry is better, and that's always a positive. I see Melo, he looks thin. It looks like he's a youngster again. Everybody seems to be working hard.\n\"You've got a lot of young players who have pretty much been in the league and have got some experience. They've got some rookies, they've got potential. [Jerian] Grant I think is going to be a good player. [Porzingis] I think is going to be a good player. He's very athletic, very talented. He's got to learn what the NBA game is about.\n\"There's some young players out there that understand there's an opportunity here. Nobody's going to take Melo's spot. But after that, everybody is saying wait a minute, 'Who's playing all these other positions?' So you're going to get a lot of competition and you've got guys hustling and playing well. I think 'Rook' [Porzingis] probably figures he's going to be a starter. I figure he's going to be a starter, too. But after that you don't know.\n\"We've got a couple of guys who were here last year, but there's an opportunity for guys to come here and play and make a contribution. You've got to have at least 10 good players, they'll have that.\"\nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s sports newsletter for stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:52:05.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
