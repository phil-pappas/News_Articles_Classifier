You’re a part of what happened before.” \nThat’s the objective for Bellemare, VandeVelde and Ryan White: be as effective as possible in shutting down the opposition’s top lines so that the Flyers’ top lines can go out and score. \n“You play against a big line and I wouldn’t like to see our top line in our D zone for 45 seconds, getting tired against their fourth line,” Bellemare said, “because then you know that your first line is going to get tired the next time they go on the ice and they’re the guys who are supposed to score so maybe they won’t have this power.” \nBellemare’s line played mostly against the Rangers’ top line of Rick Nash, Derek Stepan and Mats Zuccarello in Saturday’s 3-2 overtime win. Bellemare played 15:48, his second-most ice time in a game this season. The goal of shutting down the opposition is the same regardless of the opponent. \nIt wasn’t as if the task was different just because it was the Rangers, a team that has had the Flyers’ number in recent years. New coach Dave Hakstol is reluctant to even acknowledge the past, so there was no special treatment given to the divisional opponent. \n“I find it hard to put a percentage on it, I think it’s kind of silly to do that, but I think it’s got to be 90 percent about us and 10 percent about your opponent,” Hakstol said. “You have to prepare for your opponent and respect your opponent and know what you do well, but at the end of the day you have to mostly prepare to go and do the things that we need to do to be successful. We’ve tried to keep the focus there. We’ll try to continue to do that in the future.” \nIn terms of a breakdown on self-preparation against opponent preparation, Bellemare said Hakstol isn’t greatly different than former coach Craig Berube last year, but, “maybe the guys had the same system so there was less reviewing of our system last year. That’s why this year it feels like we’re mostly talking about ourselves. We’re reviewing what we’re doing right and what we’re doing wrong.” \nSaturday night against the Rangers, Bellemare’s line did a lot of things right, accounting for six of the Flyers’ 48 shots. \n“We were lucky enough to play well in our own zone, which makes the transition go with confidence in their zone,” Bellemare said. “When we threw the puck down, we knew we were gonna win that puck and cycle and roll it. We had a couple good chances.” Neuvirth placed on IR \nBecause the Flyers recalled Jason LaBarbera to back-up Steve Mason on Saturday, they had to put Michal Neuvirth on injured reserve. He is eligible to return on Thursday. \nNeuvirth left Wednesday’s game in Boston after the first period. With 2:36 to go in the period, Patrice Bergeron scored by batting the puck out of mid-air. In the process, he whacked Neuvirth in the head, but there was no penalty called. \nEven though video clearly shows Neuvirth getting hit in the head, he wouldn’t admit to it. The wrath of general manager Ron Hextall, who wants all injuries to be secret, can be more painful than an “upper-body injury.” \n“I’m not allowed to tell you anything,” Neuvirth said. \nThe goalie did say that he felt good in Sunday’s optional practice. Nothing for Gudas \nFlyers defenseman Radko Gudas did not hear from the NHL regarding his hit on Viktor Stalberg with 1:08 to go in the second period. The Rangers defenseman had his head down and possessed the puck when Gudas hit him from the weak side. \nThe Rangers continued down the ice and had a shot on goal. When Mason stopped the puck, Jarret Stoll had some words for Gudas, but didn’t challenge him to a fight. \nGudas was not penalized. Stalberg left the game and didn’t return and was ruled out of the Rangers’ game Sunday against Calgary. \n“I don’t think (Stoll) saw it properly,” Gudas said. \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com .
