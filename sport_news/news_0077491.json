The Patriots would fight hard early, trailing just 14-13 at the half, but the 2nd half was dominated by big plays by the Blue Raiders as they would take the win 41-19 over UC. The loss moves the Patriots to 4-2 overall on the season. \nLWC would find the scoreboard first in the opening quarter on a 2 yard run by Dylan Beasley, giving them a 7-0 lead after a 12 play, 80 yard drive. UC would answer in the 2nd quarter with a 1 yard TD run from Adam Craig (Jackson, TN) to even the score at 7-7. Beasley would then take to the air with a 61 yard pass to Carmetrick Ross to retake the lead 14-7 over UC late in the quarter. Just before half, UC would respond with a 2 yard TD run by Hunter Lewis (Dunlap, TN). The point after try was blocked, giving the Blue Raiders a 14-13 lead at the break. \nIn the 3rd quarter, LWC would extend their lead on two passing TDs, one from Beasley to Allen Cooks (15 yds) and one from Beasley to Ross (17 yds) to make it 28-13 at the end of 3 quarters of play. In the 4th, UC would respond with another TD run by Lewis, this one from 16 yards out. The two point conversion attempt was no good, making it 28-19. The Blue Raiders would add two more scores in the 4th including a 40 yard TD pass from Cory Davenport to Josh Neal on a double pass and a 7 yard TD run by Beasley, giving the Blue Raiders the 41-19 victory over UC. \nBy the Numbers • Hunter Lewis was the offensive workhorse in this game for UC, carrying the ball 26 times for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns. • Adam Craig added 12 carries for 48 yards and a score. He also went 12-23 through the air for 126 yards. • Seph Burke (Danville, KY) would also be a big factor on offense for UC with 15 carries for 117 yards. He would also be UC’s leading receiver with 4 catches for 34 yards. • The Patriots were led by Corey Washington (Knoxville, TN) defensively with 6 total tackles (4 solos) with 1 sack and 2 tackles for loss. • Both teams would tally over 450 yards of offense in the game. It was LWC who would capitalize though on two Patriot turnovers in the game. \nUp Next The Patriots will return to the road on Saturday October 17th as they travel to Grayson, Kentucky to take on MSC East Division opposition Kentucky Christian University.
