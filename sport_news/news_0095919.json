Just eight drivers can advance into the Eliminator Round.\nThe 12 remaining drivers in the Chase at Dega, in order of current standings are: Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, Kurt Busch, Carl Edwards, Kevin Harvick, Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch, Ryan Newman, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Matt Kenseth.\nThat means there's plenty of drama for Talladega's CampingWorld.com 500 on Sunday afternoon. (Dale Jr., for example, likely must win the race to advance.)\nFor more information on what's at stake at Talladega:\nCheck out a complete Chase Grid at NASCAR's official website.\nAlso check out the complete driver standings and results from the 2015 season.", "external_links": ["http://www.nascar.com/en_us/sprint-cup-series/standings.html", "http://www.nascar.com/chase-grid.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:56:39.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
