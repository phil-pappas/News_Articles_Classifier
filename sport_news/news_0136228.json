(AP) - A man with a felony record has been charged with possession of a firearm in connection with the fatal shooting of an off-duty Memphis police officer, authorities said Monday.\nLorenzo Clark, 36, was charged in the shooting death of 31-year-old Terence Olridge, who had been on the Memphis Police Department just a little over a year. He is the second police officer to die in a shooting in less than three months.\nMemphis police spokesman Louis Brownlee said Olridge and Clark were involved in an argument that escalated into a shootout in the Memphis suburb of Cordova. The two men were neighbors. Olridge was on his way to work Sunday at about 1 p.m. when the encounter with Clark happened.\nThe men exchanged gunfire, and Olridge was struck. He went back to his house and tried to get help. He was taken to a hospital, where he died. Police say Clark surrendered peacefully after the shooting.\nBrownlee declined to say whether more charges would be filed in the case.\nClark was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday. Court records did not show whether he had a lawyer who could be contacted for comment.\nOlridge is one of four Memphis officers have been shot to death in just over four years and the second fatally shot in the past 2.5 months.\n\"It just doesn't get any easier,\" Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong told reporters Sunday. \"I didn't think that we'd be here again so soon.\"\nHe noted that the investigation is in its early phases, adding that \"details are sketchy.\"\nPolice on Sunday blocked the street in front of the house where the shooting happened. A plainclothes detective spoke with a neighbor. Uniformed officers also were on the scene.\nOlridge, who joined the department in September 2014, had a fiancee who is four months pregnant, Armstrong said.\nRelatives of the officer could be seen crying outside the hospital where he was taken.\nIn August, Memphis police officer Sean Bolton was fatally shot in the line of duty. Police have charged 29-year-old Tremaine Wilbourn, who was on probation for an armed bank robbery, with first-degree murder in Bolton's death.\nOfficer Tim Warren was killed while responding to a shooting at a downtown Memphis hotel in July 2011. In December 2012, Officer Martoiya Lang was killed while serving a warrant.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
