Outside factors like where a photographer is positioned, opportunity, randomness and a little bit of luck make all the difference between an iconic shot and just another nice photo.\nAnd it’s the iconic portraits that tell an unforgettable and time-defying story. Robert L. Smith, who will be inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame next month, knows this as well as anybody.\nSmith’s father, Tex, was a “non-professional photographer,” as Smith puts it. He took pictures of everything and passed his passion to his son. Smith honed his craft at Seneca Vocational High School in Buffalo, studying photography. From there, he was drafted into the Navy in 1950 and served four years as a photographer. After his discharge, he worked at Bell Aircraft, running tools to the workers who needed them.\nBut he was always thinking about photography. Smith would go to the photography floor every day at lunch and talk with the workers. It’s all he wanted to do. Eventually, a photography job opened up in the company, and Smith was hired.\n“I made a real pest of myself,” he said.\nSmith went on to work nearly 40 years at The Buffalo News, starting in 1955. He also worked 42 years with the Buffalo Bills, from 1960-2002. He covered Super Bowls. He covered triumph. He covered tragedy. He covered history. Now, he shares the stories behind some of his most iconic shots.\nDecember 16, 1973: Bills at Jets. It’s the final game of the regular season and the football world was watching for one reason: O.J. Simpson. The superstar needed 197 yards to become the first player in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards. He finished with an even 200 yards to record 2,003.\nThere was a public relations person on the sidelines at Shea Stadium in Flushing, with the sole job of alerting the photographers how many yards Simpson was away from breaking the record. Twenty-five yards, 23 yards, 18 yards, Smith recalls hearing, until it was two yards.\n“We knew he wasn’t going to play after the 2,000 yards,” Smith said. “They were going to pull him out so we had to get it. … At that point, you shoot everything.”\nEven on the sidelines, there are rivalries. Most are friendly, as was the case between Smith and Courier-Express photographer Ron Moscati.\n“Ron and I were always competitors,” Smith recalled. “We both got the shot of O.J. scoring his 2,003 yards except mine showed his shoes he was wearing and I got paid $10,000 for that picture. I thought Ron was going to go out of his mind when he found out.”\nApril 1, 1957: Talk about being at the right place at the right time. Smith happened to be on the streets of Buffalo shooting an assignment (he doesn’t remember which one) when police detectives he knew in Buffalo called him over. They asked Smith if he wanted to shoot a rock star that night at Memorial Auditorium. Smith agreed, then asked “What’s the guy’s name?”\nElvis Presley.\nAt that point, Smith was on board. Smith took his shots of Presley backstage – just like he was asked to do – then an ultimately life-changing opportunity came about.\n“Elvis came up to me and said, ‘Would you like to come on stage with me and shoot some pictures of me performing?’ ”\nTalk about a no-brainer. Smith took 27 photos that night and one of those 27 shots proved to be the most valuable picture of his career. When Smith was finished, he went over to The News to develop the photos. During development, he knew he had one great shot, and this one shot would change his life. The photograph of Elvis dancing on his toes in tight black pants with his guitar in his right hand ran on the front page of every edition of The News that day.\nSmith sent the photo to Elvis’ business partner, Colonel Tom Parker. Smith never heard back from Parker, but 43 years later, Smith learned the picture had become quite famous. The photo was featured in Memphis and in Elvis’ hometown of Graceland, but Smith was never made aware of it.\nSmith went down to Memphis and found his photo blown up to life size in the Memphis Rock N’ Soul Museum. Naturally, Smith was curious whom the photo was credited to.\n“We went over there and there was a big plaque on the wall,” Smith said. “It says ‘Photograph taken Buffalo, New York, photographer unknown’.”\nSmith didn’t know his picture was in the museum. He spoke with the manager, gave him sufficient proof the shots were his and when Smith returned on his way back to New York, he saw a plaque that said “Robert L. Smith, Buffalo, New York.” And that was all he wanted – the recognition.\nHe did want financial compensation from Elvis enterprises. After many months, he received a settlement with Elvis’ people – an amount only known by Elvis’ people, Smith, his wife and attorney.\nRed Cross work: Smith’s standout moment with the Red Cross came during the Blizzard of 1977 in Western New York. Because Smith was working with the Red Cross, he was one of the only photographers allowed on the road during the storm.\nHe was much more than a photographer during this exhibition. Yes, he took his photos. But he was also in the homes with the victims who felt trapped inside. He helped make sure they made it out to safety.\nSmith was given “free rein” to shoot all the photos he wanted during the storm. The Red Cross still uses his photos to show the horrific consequences of that storm.\nThe Present: Now, Smith shoots weddings every now and then. Along with wedding side jobs, he sells some of his more iconic photos – mostly Bills photos and the Elvis shots. His photographs through his illustrious career continue to leave a mark on the area.\nThe Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame induction ceremony is Nov. 4 at the Buffalo Niagara Convention Center. Tickets are $95 each, $850 for a table of 10 and includes a 25th anniversary book.
