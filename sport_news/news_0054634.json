The pass was completed to running back Kamario Bell in the first quarter on Friday. \nColumbia ran the Bolles homecoming script through the paper shredder. \nLatrell Williams dealt the final blow with a fourth-quarter kickoff return, sealing the Tigers’ 49-20 victory over host Bolles on homecoming night at Skinner-Barco Stadium Friday. \nAlfonzo Battle and Kenny Johnson returned interceptions for touchdowns, quarterback Davin Schuck commanded a high-flying spread offense and the Columbia line stifled a formerly unstoppable Bulldogs ground unit. \nFor the Lake City school and coach Brian Allen, this was a night for statements. \n“Two weeks ago, we gave up 44 points in the first half and everybody’s wondering, ‘What’s going on with Columbia’s defense?’” he said. “We came out tonight and did a great job against a very good Bolles team.” \nThe Bulldogs (6-1) struck first at the end of the opening quarter, when Isaiah Westbrook took an out route from Mac Jones and lunged for the pylon for a 19-yard score. \nFrom that point on, it was Tigers time. \nNose guard Robbie Moon and end Ranadree Bradley stuffed the tricky Bolles running game, tempting the Bulldogs into increasingly risky ventures through the air. \nIn a three-minute span in the second quarter, Columbia exploited two Bulldogs miscues to ignite a 28-point second quarter. \nStrike one came when Battle jumped on an underthrown out pattern from Jones, dashing untouched for a 24-yard interception return to put Columbia on top. \nThen, strike two: Safety Kenny Johnson sat deep as Jones threw into heavy traffic along the right sideline, following his blockers for a 41-yard return. \n“Our defense was able to come out and get a spark,” Allen said. “Those two quick scores changed the momentum.” \nThe Tigers (5-1) pounced again before halftime, as Schuck launched a 93-yard drive in a minute and 40 seconds, capped with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Nathan Maxwell. \nAlong the way, quarterback Schuck showed off his improvisation, dancing behind the line of scrimmage and spraying passes to the receiving corps of Maxwell, Williams, Dallon Washington and Michael Jackson. \nThen, as Bolles fought back to within 28-20 with 10:55 to go, Williams took the Bulldogs kickoff and dashed straight through a gaping hole on his way to a 91-yard touchdown. \n“We wanted to prove to everybody that just because we lost last week, that doesn’t mean we’ve got our heads down,” Williams said. \nWilliams finished with 7 catches for 111 yards for Columbia, while Schuck completed 21 of 35 passes for 264 yards. \nAll is not lost for the Bulldogs, for whom much of the season rides on the Oct. 30 contest with unbeaten Raines at the Graveyard. That game will likely decide the District 2-4A championship. \nBut for Columbia, the overwhelming favorite in District 2-7A, Friday’s victory sent a message to Northeast Florida. \n“We wanted to have that feel-good moment going into our district schedule,” Allen said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:45:52.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
