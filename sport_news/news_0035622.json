A lost national title game. A suspension that lasted half a season.\nGone was the luster of the transfer.\nVernon Adams Jr. won the starting job out of fall camp, broke his finger and watched on the sideline as the Oregon Ducks fell out of the playoff picture and then the polls.\nMichigan State. Utah. Washington State. All losses.\nWashington could have been next, until the receiver returning from suspension teamed up with the quarterback returning from injury to flip the script and give Oregon its 12th consecutive win over the Washington Huskies, 26-20.\nAdams had 272 yards and two scores. Carrington caught both of those touchdowns en route to a 125-yard season debut. It seemed like chemistry born underneath a slight drizzle inside Husky Stadium.\nOnly it wasn't. This was an on-field relationship forged through after-the-bell workouts in the fall. Even knowing the two wouldn't connect for real until October, Carrington and Adams put in extra hours. They threw together at the rec center. They developed a friendship. The results on Saturday may have been a surprise, but not to them.\n\"After long days we would go, and on our days off, we would get something in,\" Adams said. \"You get that timing. Me and him, definitely, we went to the rec and got it down.\"\nIt helped that on the day Oregon got its best deep threat back, Adams finally had the fingers to get it to him. Since breaking his index finger in Week 1 against Eastern Washington, Adams has been a shell of himself. He played with mixed results in a loss to Michigan State, sat against Georgia State, was a disaster against Utah and watched from the sideline the last two weeks against Colorado and Washington State.\nAs he healed, the Ducks sank. But the finger is getting better and on Saturday he had his fastball back. Adams didn't play with a glove or a splint and flung the ball better than Oregon has seen since No. 8. And he quickly found a rhythm with Carrington, who has earned praise from coaches and teammates for his practice habits even in the midst of suspension.\nIt took one drive to see that with both players on the field, the Ducks were different. Adams hit Dwayne Stanford for 48 yards on Oregon's third play from scrimmage. Three plays later, Adams skied a ball 36 yards toward the end zone and into the hands of Carrington, making his first catch since his stellar Rose Bowl. He now has 19 catches for 416 yards and five touchdowns over his last three games.\n\"Man, I almost shed a tear,\" Carrington said, \"but it was just all smiles. You never know how fast it can be gone, but it was just good to be back out there.\"\nSome may say the emergence of Adams-to-Carrington is too late for the Ducks. Oregon (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) is out of the playoff picture and the meaty portion of the schedule remains on the horizon. After a bye, Oregon is on the road against Arizona State, then it's Cal, Stanford and USC before ending with Oregon State. It's the portion of the schedule that Adams was brought in for from Eastern Washington, and the type of opponents where a receiver of Carrington's talent is needed.\n\"Huge impact,\" head coach Mark Helfrich said of the passing game. \"When the team has confidence in the quarterback or a little bit of juice, just as they do for Royce (Freeman) or DeForest Buckner, you know that elevates everybody.\"\nAnd there is still more than pride to play for. The Ducks still have an outside shot at winning the Pac-12 North, but they'll need some help. They'll also probably need to run the table. And while there are plenty of things that still need to be addressed, it seems that at least a healthy Adams teamed with Carrington fixes the biggest problem of all: The deep threat is back.\n\"I think that was just the beginning,\" Carrington said. \"We're just going to get better from there and I think we're about to take off.\"\n-- Tyson Alger\ntalger@oregonian.com\n@tysonagler", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:22:50.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
