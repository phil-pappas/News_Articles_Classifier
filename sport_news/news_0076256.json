So much for a close game. \nThe Bulldogs are 8-0, ranked No. 1 in the state in Class 4A by The Associated Press and headed into the Section 5-4A playoffs as probably the No. 2 seed, believe it or not. Orono is likely getting No. 1 because the Spartans’ schedule is dotted with 5A programs. \nThe pairings will be finalized Saturday morning. \nBecker, which has won 20 in a row, plays its share of 3A schools in the East Central District North Division, which hurt the Bulldogs in the QRF power rankings that are used to determine section seedings. But whoever they’ve played, they’ve been impressive in claiming the first East Central North title that was awarded afterward. \n“Everything was going right for us tonight,” said Becker quarterback Andrew Stanger, who threw three long touchdown passes to Alex Meidt on a night when the Bulldogs’ displayed their big-play capabilities regularly. \n“We knew they were a big-play offense and they showed it,” Albany head coach Mike Kleinschmidt said. “They’re a very talented, athletic team.” \nAlbany was unbeaten and ranked second in the state in Class 3A. Bt the Bulldogs opened the scoring with a 75-yard punt return for a score by Tyler Thorson. Thorson took a handoff from Alex Meidt on the punt. Lucas Dertinger’s kick made it 7-0 with 7:53 to go in the first half. \n“That was huge,” said Becker head coach Dwight Lundeen, who won his 337th career game. “We played well in all three areas, offensively, defensively and special teams.” \nBecker also scored on a 32-yard fumble recovery return by Pauly. On a play that was ruled a backwards pass, Pauly picked it up off the ground after it hit teammate Milan Kent and ran into the end zone to put the Bulldogs up 28-0. \nThe Huskies got a late touchdown in the first half. \nBut, Kent blocked a punt on Albany’s first drive of the second half. Gabe Dertinger then took the first play of scrimmage 35 yards for a rushing touchdown. Another PAT by Lucas Dertinger made it 35-6. \n“It was fun,” Becker two-way tackle Casey Vesledahl said. “Albany’s pretty tough and physical. \n“But I think we showed that we’re a team that plays physical, too.” \nAfter an Austin Rasmussen interception, Becker went nine plays to score its last TD. Stanger found Meidt one more time with 59.9 seconds to go in the third quarter. \nMeidt had touchdown catches of 71, 26 and 37 yards. All were in man-to-man coverage. \nStanger admitted he gets excited when Meidt’s running down field with one defender guarding him. \n“Especially with Alex out there,” he said. “It’s hard to hit him sometimes because he’s so open.” \nAlbany (7-1) is likely to still wind up with the top seed in Section 5-3A. The playoffs begin Tuesday for Albany’s section and are Wednesday for Becker’s section. \n“I really thought our guys showed resiliency with that long drive,” Kleinschmidt said. “But we gave up a lot of big plays. \n“You have to tip your hat to them.” \nFirst quarter \nB — Tyler Thorson 75 punt return (Luke Dertinger kick) \nB —Alex Meidt 71 pass from Andrew Stanger (kick failed) \nSecond quarter \nB — Meidt 26 pass from Stanger (Clayton Gallus pass from Stanger) \nB — Beau Pauly 32 fumble return (L.
