He started the group match against Namibia. \nThe scrum will be a key focal point of the semi-final, with the Australian pack making big gains in the set-piece under the tutelage of former Pumas hooker Mario Ledesma, who played in four World Cups including Argentina’s run to the 2007 semi-finals. \nThe Australian scrum, heavily criticised in losses in Britain last November, got the better of the English and Welsh packs in the group stage, but struggled at times against Scotland and conceded some important penalties in their quarter-final win. \nWhile much has been made of Argentina’s new, expansive approach to the game, the scrum is still the pride of the Pumas. At the same time, the traditionally free-running Wallabies are gaining some respect for their scrum. \n“We still haven’t studied it in-depth, but we know them and that their scrum will be extremely tough because they’ve come a long way there,” Montoya said. “Australia wasn’t really a scrummaging team and now they’re very good at it. \n“It will be very close, and for us it’s great if they scrummage a lot because it’ll tire them. I don’t know Ledesma, but I know he’s been very instrumental in improving their scrum.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:42:38.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
