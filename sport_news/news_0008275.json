He can easily give you a smile and it’s a kick in the butt. He’s not going to blow his head and jump all over you.”\nTurner says that approach doesn’t work with grown men, anyway. He’s seen coaches try it, only to have it backfire.\nAt this point a Bomber fan might rightfully point out the obvious. Scream it out, actually: O’SHEA’S APPROACH ISN’T FREAKING WORKING EITHER!\nNo, it’s not. After starting last season 5-1, the Bombers went 2-10. Combined with this year’s record, they’ve won just six of their last 26 games.\nYet, he hasn’t changed from those early days. He still won’t coach with fear, preferring a verbal caress to a curse, keeping a promise he made to his players from the start.\n“If I say get the job done, or get the (curse word) job done, it means the exact same thing,” is what Turner remembers his coach saying. “He let us know that early. So guys understood it exactly. And he’s been that way ever since.”\nEven as the losses pile up like four-letter words.\nGoing into this weekend’s tilt in Vancouver, where his team finally has to win or else kiss its playoff chances goodbye, nothing has changed.\nThere was O’Shea during stretching exercises, Wednesday, tossing not expletives or even a harsh word, but a football at players to make sure they were alert.\nHe made sure they were ready to catch it, first.\nAnd how about getting them ready to play desperate football against B.C.?\n“I don’t know that you want to play with desperation in mind,” O’Shea said. “You want to have a good understanding that it’s playoff football. We’re approaching this as a must-win game. But I don’t know that leads to desperation.\n“Sometimes if you’re desperate you’re losing focus. That’s what that word brings to mind, is maybe a loss of focus and a frantic pace without maybe direction. And we don’t want that.”\nNo, like every other week, you just want a win.\nOr you’ll have three meaningless games to be as happy as you want, while nobody gives a four-letter word.\nPAUL FRIESEN\nWhere's the angst?
