We like ice in our party coolers, but not on roads and powerlines. Add bitter cold with heavy snow and you’ve got a true mess.\nWinter energy tips\nYou can ease winter’s grip by following tips that are designed to keep you safe, warm and prepared – even in the aftermath of severe weather.\nHave your furnace checked by a certified professional to make sure it’s operating in peak condition. Check your filter each month and replace it as necessary based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. A dirty filter slows air flow, which means your furnace works harder to maintain a comfortable temperature. Run ceiling fans in a clockwise rotation. This circulates heated air in a manner that keeps rooms warmer. You reduce the strain on your furnace and save money. Seal leaks and gaps around your home with caulk, spray foam or weather-stripping to keep warm air in and cold air outside, where it belongs. Compile an emergency kit that includes a battery-powered radio, flashlights for everyone in the family, fresh batteries for any devices, first aid and medications. A list of emergency kit supplies can be found at www.ready.gov . Always operate a portable generator outdoors to allow proper venting. Before installing a generator, consult a licensed electrician and review the manufacturer's instructions. Wind, snow and ice can snap tree branches that fall into power lines. Never go near fallen wires and especially keep children and pets away. Downed wires are considered dangerous at all times. Call your utility company immediately to report a downed power line. Contact your utility to report a power outage. Many companies allow you to report outages from a computer or mobile device and receive restoration updates by text message. Utilities are now using outage maps that offer information specific to your ZIP code in near real time. They also can be viewed from a computer or mobile device. Winter assistance programs\nThere are many community programs in which volunteers insulate the homes of qualified customers, such as the elderly and lower-income residents. In addition, utilities have programs that support people who qualify for winter heating assistance. You can donate to these programs when paying your utility bill, and the company will sometimes offer a match.\nLEARN MORE: Find additional articles about energy-related issues from LG&E and KU\nAsk your utility for details on getting prepared for winter and helping those in need stay warm.
