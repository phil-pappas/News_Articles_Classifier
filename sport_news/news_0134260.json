Instead she finished in a share of fourth.\nFormer world number one Yani Tseng (68), who has fallen outside the top 50, continued her return to form by finishing joint second with South Korean Park Sung-hyun (71), who struggled with a cold putter on the back nine on Sunday.\nSouth Korean Amy Yang struck a joint course record 62 to vault up the leaderboard to claim a share of fourth on 13-under, alongside Ko and American Gerina Piller (67).\nKo and Park Sung-hyun had started the round with a share of the lead but the New Zealand teenager never really got going on Sunday with three bogeys in the middle of her round to drop off the pace.\nThe big-hitting Park, three times a winner on the Korean Tour this year, was always in touch but a string of missed birdie efforts over the closing holes prevented her putting more pressure on Thompson.\nThe 20-year-old American had no such problems with the short stick and recorded a run of three straight birdies from the seventh to move clear.\nAlthough she dropped a shot on the par-four 11th she produced a neat up-and-down on the driveable par-four 15th to pick up another birdie and stay clear as she calmly parred her way home.\nThe LPGA Tour continues its Asian swing next week at the Taiwan Championships, where Park In-bee is the defending champion.\n(Writing by Patrick Johnston in Singapore; Editing by John O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:07:14.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
