Waterhouse Posted: 10/09/2015 10:35:44 PM PDT Updated: 10/09/2015 10:35:45 PM PDT The Monte Vista High football team is one dangerous offensive squad. With a balanced attack, the Mustangs cruised past host Amador Valley in East Bay Athletic League play Friday night to the tune of 34-12. \nMonte Vista (5-1, 2-0 EBAL), which failed to score in the first quarter, erupted for 17 points in the second. It was paced by the ground attack of Shane Perry, who rushed for 93 yards on 16 carries with three touchdowns -- two in the second quarter. \nThrough the air, the Mustangs got a stellar performance from quarterback Jake Haener, who completed 17 of 25 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown. His top target was Noah Sol, who caught 12 passes for 151 yards and a touchdown. \nAmador (4-2, 1-1) closed to within 17-6 on a Ronnie Jones 39-yard touchdown pass to Abraham Flynn with 7:07 left in the third quarter. \nJones finished with 118 yards passing, and Flynn caught six passes for 96 yards. \nBut Monte Vista, ranked No. 4 by this newspaper, answered with a five-play, 66-yard drive that culminated with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Haener to Sol that gave the Mustangs a commanding 24-6 lead with 4:52 left in the third quarter. \nAmador Valley, ranked No. 11, got to within 24-12 on Jones' 22-yard touchdown run, but the Mustangs once again answered. \nThis time they struck for 2-yard touchdown run by Perry on a drive that ate up nearly five minutes of the clock in the fourth quarter. Advertisement \nMonte Vista's final score came off the leg of junior kicker Peyton Henry, who boomed a 52-yard field goal with 1:45 left that put Monte Vista up 34-12. It was his second field goal of the game. The first was a 36-yarder in the second quarter. De La Salle 48, San Ramon Valley 0 Antoine Custer rushed for 88 yards and two touchdowns on a short night, leading the Spartans (5-1) over the visiting Wolves (1-5). De La Salle's Alex Colon-Aguilar recovered a fumble on the game's opening kickoff at the San Ramon Valley 5. Colon-Aguilar took it in from the 4 for the game's first score. \nThe Spartans were up 28-0 at the end of the first quarter and 42-0 midway through the second quarter. The clock was running the entire second half. \nKevin Davidson started at quarterback for the Wolves, his first start of the season. The 6-foot-4, 220-pound senior had sat out the first five games after being ruled ineligible last year while playing for McClymonds. Davidson completed 2 of 11 passes for 20 yards. \nDavidson originally played lower-level football for San Ramon Valley, then transferred to McClymonds as a junior, where he threw for 1,117 yards and 20 touchdowns in four games. However, he was declared ineligible after residency questions arose. He returned to the Wolves in August. -- Damin Esper, correspondent San Ramon V. 0 0 0 0-- 0 De La Salle 28 14 0 6-- 48 DLS -- Colon-Aguilar 4 run (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Custer 54 run (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Custer 23 run (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Sweeney 10 run (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Andrade 1 fumble return (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Colon-Aguilar 3 run (Williams kick) \nDLS -- Coray-Dozier 8 run (kick failed) Records -- San Ramon Valley 1-5, De La Salle 5-1.
