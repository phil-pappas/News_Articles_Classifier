After the Browns' 27-20 defeat to the Oakland Raiders, a lot of questions have been raised on who should start for the Browns at quarterback this weekend.\nAdChoices TMZ reported Tuesday that three starters for the Browns were Quote: d saying they would rather see Manziel under center. Brian Hartline and Andrew Hawkins both stated that this was a false report and the locker room is behind McCown 100 percent.\nBut shouldn’t the Browns at least take a serious look at starting Manziel Sunday against the Chargers?\nThat is a question many NFL teams have been faced with over the years. Should we go with the vet, or should we give the young gun a chance to show what he can do?\nThe question is not easy to answer. Do you have enough talent to win right now with the vet, or should you take the time to polish the young kid's game to see if he can play in the league?\nThe fans want to see Johnny Football\nCome on, how many Browns fans actually want to see Josh McCown out there?\nJohnny is what he is right now, but he is still electric and exciting to watch.\nJosh McCown is what he is. He is a great backup in the NFL. McCown has been in the league for 13 years, and this is only his second real shot at starting in his career. McCown is not a Super Bowl-winning quarterback.\nWith that being said, Johnny Manziel isn’t either right now. But one thing Manziel is good at is filling the stands.\nEver since his monster game when Texas A&M upset Alabama in 2012, you can’t turn on SportsCenter without hearing this kid's name. Manziel tore the field up in college. He was the stereotypical highlight-reel quarterback that kept every fan across the country glued to the TV.\nGive your fans what they want and start the kid.\nThe fans here in Cleveland deserve something to cheer about, and seeing a 36-year-old backup quarterback in the game is not going to get the Dawg Pound roaring.\nYou could hear the boos echoing through FirstEnergy Stadium every time McCown wasn’t on point in Week 3, not to mention there were countless “Johnny” chants going on throughout the game.\nIf you walk around Cleveland on any Sunday, how many Josh McCown jerseys do you see fans wearing?\nNone. But I can promise you will see fans all over the city proudly rocking number 2.\nThey need to establish what they have in Johnny Manziel\nThe Cleveland Browns invested a first-round pick in Johnny Manziel.\nWhether that was Ray Farmer's or Jimmy Haslam’s decision may never be known, but regardless the Browns aren’t getting that pick back. The Browns need to figure what they have in this kid.\nManziel has only had three starts in his NFL career. Needless to say, only one of those performances went well. But Manziel’s body of work isn’t big enough to make any judgments on him yet.\nFor some frame of reference, let’s look at the tumultuous situation in Washington.\nThe Redskins have given Robert Griffin every chance to be successful in this league. Washington has put him out there time and time again, watching him continuously fail.\nHead coach Jay Gruden finally decided to pull the plug on RG3, but the team knows exactly what it has in him.\nThe Browns can’t just give up on Manziel yet. The age of letting quarterbacks sit behind a veteran and mature over time is over. This is a win-now league.\nEvery organization looks at the Brett Favre/Aaron Rodgers situation and believes it can duplicate it. One major difference is that Rodgers had a first-ballot Hall-of-Famer in front of him, and Johnny has a 36-year-old journeyman who has a career record of 17-34.\nYes, McCown can teach him how to be a professional and how to be an NFL player off the field. But as far as playing goes, McCown has no business giving Manziel any tips whatsoever.\nIf the Browns give Manziel the rest of the season to start, we can at least see what he is. Whether that is a lifetime backup or the potential future of the team, at least we’ll know.\nNo matter who is out there on Sundays, the Browns are not making the playoffs this season. The team simply isn’t good enough. Let Manziel go out there, learn from his mistakes and see what he is all about.\nFor better or for worse, we need to know.\nIs McCown really that much better than Manziel?\nI haven’t seen anything that suggests that Josh McCown is better than Johnny Manziel by a significant margin. How do we know that Manziel isn’t the best option Cleveland has at winning right now?\nIn his only start of the year, Manziel and the Browns beat the Titans 28-14. Granted, he only threw 15 passes in the game, but he did have two touchdowns to Travis Benjamin that really sparked the team and gave Cleveland a reason to believe he can be a legitimate NFL quarterback.\nJosh McCown’s play against the Raiders was subpar to say the least. Completing just 57% of his passes and throwing a pick at the end of the game that sealed the victory for Oakland, McCown was over- and under-throwing his targets all day long.\nThe passes he seemed to be accurate on were little dump-offs to Duke Johnson and over-the-middle passes to tight end Gary Barnidge. When it came to throwing to the corners, he couldn’t connect with anybody.\nEven more notably, there was a huge difference in the last two games in the Browns' body language on the field. Against the Titans, Browns players seemed fired up and ready to go from the start. Manziel did an excellent job of being a leader and commanding the troops.\nIn Week 3 against Oakland, however, the Browns came out flat and sluggish. I honestly believe that the majority of Browns players want to Johnny Manziel under center.\nJust looking at the body language of the Browns when McCown starts vs. when Johnny starts paints a clear picture. When McCown starts overthrowing receivers and missing wide-open targets, players are hanging their heads and losing hope in the team.\nAnd let’s not ignore the excitement of the “Johnny factor” either.\nThe “Johnny factor” is the idea that Manziel can take off and run at any given moment. If the pocket collapses, he has the ability to escape and take off. That is something every defense around the league has to respect when you have a running quarterback.\nIt just gives the defensive another element to think about. Whether Manziel runs or not, you have to respect the idea. And just when you think he’s taking off to run, he can keep his eyes downfield and find an open receiver as well.\nThere’s a lot that Manziel brings to the table that Josh McCown just doesn’t offer.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:16:23.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
