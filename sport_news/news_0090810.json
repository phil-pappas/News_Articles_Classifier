Three days later it capped its week with a five set victory over the Summerville Bears in Tuolumne. The Bears took sets one and four 25-22 and 25-23 while the ‘Skins took the second and third set 25-15 and 25-21 — and ultimately the deciding fifth set 15-8. “It’s been a really good week,” said Calaveras head coach Pamela DiBasilio. “We are really strong defensively and our serve receive is probably the strongest part of our game. But we just have to figure out how to go around other hitters. We are not super heavy hitters. Summerville played really hard tonight .” Summerville started strong in the first set, and built a 12-8 lead with the help of senior Sarah Boyer. Boyer was outstanding early in the match, and every time she touched the ball, something good happened for the Bears. Boyer finished the night with nine kills and 21 digs. “Sarah is one of our captains who is a fighter and she wants to win,” said Summerville head coach Jennifer Osterhout. “We did a lot of work in practice yesterday figuring out her hit. We tweaked it a little bit, just enough to make her a force at the net. If we can continue with that, she’s going to help us out a lot.” Summerville picked up the first set win with key blocks from Julian Craddock, Janae Roberson and Claire Caldera. Calaveras began the second set on fire, building a 7-2 lead. Summerville dug into the ‘Skins lead, but Katie Church pushed the Bears serge back with a powerful kill, bringing the score to 15-7. Summerville had no answer to the Calaveras attack, and the ‘Skins took the second set. “We just wanted to eliminate our errors and serve a little smarter,” DiBasilio said of the second set adjustments. “We had to pick where we were serving a little bit better and strategize where to hit the ball.” “It was all mental for us in the second set,” Osterhout said. “We came off of the momentum of the first set and just were not performing. We were not communicating and it took a lot to get us out of the hole and start talking and fighting for it.” Summerville bounced back and in the third set matched the ‘Skins blow for blow. Down 19-16, Danika Lillie made a diving save which set up a point for the Bears. Summerville tied the game at 20 with a kill from Roberson. But Calaveras went on a 5-1 run to take set three. Laney Evans led the charge for the ‘Skins. “Laney played really well tonight ,” DiBasilio said. “She’s a super smart hitter and a smart player. She just has to find the openings and once she does, she starts scoring for us.” Once again, Summerville found itself down early in the fourth set, but behind the serves of sophomore Grace Fulkerson, and stellar play from Craddock, the Bears went on a 7-0 run. Craddock finished the night with seven kills and 21 assists. “I was telling them that they had to swing and they had to be aggressive,” Osterhout said. “Craddock went up and gave it everything she had and that is what we needed to have to help swing the momentum to our side.” Summerville took the fourth set to set up a first-to-15 fifth set. “I just wanted us to stay focused and not get down on ourselves if we got behind,” DiBasilio said. “We just had to stay calm and play our game.” Calaveras (7-3, 3-1 MLL) dominated the final set, thanks in large part to an early 5-0 run. “This loss is easier to bounce back from because it wasn’t a huge sweep,” Osterhout said. “It was good to see them fight and we saw the things that we need to continue doing and some things that we need to work on. This is an easier loss to come back from. It’s still hard and kills us a little bit, but it’s definitely an easier loss to deal with.” “This is a big win, a really big win,” DiBasilio said. “I don’t wanna lose any. We already lost to Sonora, so no more loses.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:21:58.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
