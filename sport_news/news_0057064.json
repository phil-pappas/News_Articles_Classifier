The Jets won, 6-2.\nChara took part in the morning skate before the opener at the Garden and allowed himself to take a few light slap shots, but didn’t overextend himself. The defenseman admitted to being cautious with the injury.\nAsked if this was the first game of the playoffs instead of the first game of the season, Chara said he would have been playing “probably two weeks ago.”\nBut the 38-year-old defenseman, who missed 19 games with a knee injury and then played the final three games with a broken fibula last season, said he’s fine with being cautious.\n“I’m OK to be smart about it,” said Chara. “Obviously I want to play as soon as I can, but at the same time it’s Game 1. Not that it’s less important with any other game but at this time I just want to continue to have progress and continue to move forward instead of having setbacks.”\nBruins coach Claude Julien said Chara remains day-to-day.\n“There’s no doubt today he’s better than yesterday. I guess we’re hoping it’s going to be sooner than later, and that could be next game (against Montreal tomorrow) for all we know,” said Julien.\nJulien said Chara and the club need to weigh the level of risk the player would be taking if he were to get back in the lineup before he’s 100 percent.\n“If it’s minimal, maybe you (play),” said Julien. “If there’s more damage that can be done playing him a game or two earlier versus being being safer down the road, then why not. You’ve got to be smart about your decisions you’re making. To me, if there’s no risk and he’s got to play hurt, or little risk, and he’s got to play with a little bit of pain, no problem. If it’s the other way around, if there’s a big risk, then why risk it when it’s early in the season?”\nChara joined fellow Dennis Seidenberg , who is out until next month following back surgery, on the shelf. With the loss of both those defensive stalwarts, the Bruins were left with a pretty green defensive corps for last night’s game. Adam McQuaid and Torey Krug , projected to be the third pair when training camp opened, were the team’s top pair, followed by Joe Morrow with Kevan Miller and Matt Irwin with Zach Trotman.\n“We’ve been through it before,” said Julien. “We dealt with it last year when he was out for a while. You have to deal with those situations. My preoccupation can’t be about what I’m missing, but what I’ve got and what I’ve got tonight I think is enough for us to win a hockey game. All we have to do is go out and show it.”\nMcQuaid was getting ready for anything.\n“I don’t really know what to expect, but I’ll obviously be prepared for (first-pair duty),” he said. “Whether we’ll have definitive 1-2-3 pairings, I’m not quite sure but I think we’re all capable of playing. It’s a pretty solid three pairings. You have to be prepared to play against anyone.”\nTrotman is expected to be Chara’s partner when the teamn’s giant captain returns.\nScratch the surface\nThe healthy scratches were Ty Randell , Colin Miller and Max Talbot , who cleared waivers on Tuesday but remains with the team until Chara comes off injured reserve. The fourth line consisted of Zac Rinaldo , Joonas Kemppainen and Chris Kelly . . . .\nThere were a half dozen new faces on the Bruins roster for the opener, but Julien was taking it in stride.\n“Well, my first year I had over twenty new guys. I didn’t know anybody, right?” he said. “So that was probably more than it is this year and I managed to get through it. So you know, I think it’s been a good three-plus weeks where we’ve been able to kind of work individually, as a group, as a line, with different players and different personalities. And everything right now, we’re pleased with it — we’re optimistic and we just have to let things work themselves out, too. So I don’t have any issues with the number of new players. I just have a preoccupation with getting the whole group ready to play.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:09:54.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
