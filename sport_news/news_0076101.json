Brad Nettles/Staff × When Deshaun Watson runs onto the football field, the Clemson quarter- back is wearing protective gear based on aerospace technology developed in Charleston. \nLeapTech \nFounder and owner: Chris Osborne \nLocation: 1629 Folly Road \nEmployees: 15 \nProducts: Recycles carbon fiber into exoskeleton for Russell Athletics’ CarbonTek shoulder pads. Other carbon fiber products have included auto body parts, softball bats and solar panels. Trucks travel daily from the Boeing manufacturing facility in North Charleston carrying scraps of carbon fiber from the construction of 787 Dreamliner passenger jets to LeapTech, a company off Folly Road. LeapTech buys the lightweight but tough, man- made leftovers and converts them into the exoskeleton for Russell Athletics’ CarbonTek shoulder pads. Watson is one of 15 Clemson players wearing CarbonTek pads. “They’re smaller,” Watson said of the shoulder pads. “They fit my shoulders better than the other ones (from high school). A little bit lighter. They just fit better on the shoulders. Some of the receivers have them, and the running backs. Most of the skill players have them.” Clemson primarily uses Douglas shoulder pads, but the quarterbacks, receivers and cornerbacks wear CarbonTek pads. “The guys who wear the CarbonTek, including Deshaun, would probably say that they like the mobility and lightweight nature of the pad,” Clemson assistant equipment manager D.J. Gordon said. “Certain guys may shy away from them as they simply feel more comfortable in their Douglas pads, but the few who wear them appreciate the comfort that the Russell pad brings.” Local entrepreneur Chris Osborne, owner of LeapTech, said he watches college football much differently now that his company has a vested interest in games. “My friends get really annoyed watching games with me. I’m saying, ‘That’s ours, that’s ours, that’s ours.’ I’m looking at the sidelines a lot, looking for equipment failure, at people who look uncomfortable,” the Clemson graduate said. “I’m meeting equipment managers, talking to players about what they want. Knowing the physics of two guys running into each other at full speed, it’s so cool. I’ve learned so much about football doing this and there are still a lot of things I’m learning every day.” Horse blankets Russell Athletics, based in Bowling Green, Ky., owns a collection of brands, including Bike Athletics, which at one point was a major supplier of shoulder pads. “We decided that if we are going to do shoulder pads that we didn’t want to do the same shoulder pad that everyone else in the market is doing,” said Laura McCaslin, sports marketing manager for Russell Athletics. The idea for the foam portion of the pad came from a concept used for horse blankets created for Auburn University’s equestrian team. “We’re not really in the market for horses, but we took that idea and built protective gear for football,” McCaslin said. Rather than go with the traditional plastic used in most football gear, Russell began considering other possibilities, McCaslin said, and the company connected with Osborne. “He helped us come up with this design and shape. It’s carbon fiber that’s molded to fit to the athlete. It not only looks cool, but it also performs much better than the plastic. We’ve been working on the shoulder pad almost three years. It’s been on the market maybe a year and a half,” said McCaslin, adding that a second generation is in the production stage. Osborne said he was an entrepreneur as early as elementary school, selling pencils and Gummy Bears. He began manufacturing various items when he was in high school and continued into college. One of his earliest ventures was manufacturing carbon-fiber parts for cars, using an electric blanket to heat and cure the epoxy resin. His business helped pay for his education at Clemson, where he majored in marketing and entrepreneurship. Osborne said the CarbonTek pads probably are his greatest accomplishment. “This is really ground-breaking technology,” he said. “I went with Russell to various schools and measured various players around their body. We made 3-D mapping around that, and we designed shoulder pads so they would form fit. It allows you to have a better range of motion. “We went to an automotive research lab and used a test dummy fit with special sensors and shot it with the equivalent of two players running into each other. We couldn’t believe the reports. We thought they were wrong so we hired a professor from NYU to do a full study. It absolutely destroyed the competition. Nothing out there protects a player like this.” ‘Zero waste’ Osborne, 31, was born in Charleston but moved with his family to the Upstate when the Navy base closed in the mid-1990s. He said he was drawn back to the Lowcountry partly because of Boeing South Carolina, which makes its 787 fuselages and other parts from carbon fibers. He said he likes the aerospace giant’s “zero waste-to-landfill” philosophy. “That means nothing from our site here goes to a landfill. It’s either repurposed, recycled, reused or sent to facilities for energy recovery,” said Rob Gross, communications manager for Boeing South Carolina. That includes repurposing material to companies such as LeapTech. On James Island, as many as 15 employees work on the shoulder pad exoskeletons, which are shipped to a plant in Iowa for final assembly. Eventually, they will make their way to college football teams across the country. The CarbonTek pads are more expensive than traditional shoulder pads, with a retail price of about $500. They usually are worn by so-called skill players — quarterbacks, receivers, running backs, defensive backs — because they offer greater range of motion, Osborne said. Because of the ties to Auburn, McCaslin said pretty much all of that school’s players are wearing the pads. Former Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, now with the Carolina Panthers, wears the foam protective vest. Other schools in the ACC and SEC, including South Carolina, also have purchased CarbonTek pads. But schools often disguise or hide logos because of lucrative financial ties to other equipment manufacturers. “I was watching a game last year where the quarterback came out and had the Russell logo visible,” Osborne said. “When they came back from halftime, the logo had been Sharpied out. Someone from Nike, Under Armour or another company called and said the Russell logo has to go.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:25:14.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
