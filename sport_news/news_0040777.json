The play of offensive guard Johnny Caspers has had a lot to do with it. \nCaspers, who has another year of eligibility left after this season, makes his 18th start for the Cardinal on Thursday night when UCLA visits Stanford Stadium. \nStanford will have had 12 days off since its 55-17 thrashing of Arizona, but Caspers believes no breaking of stride will take place up front. \n\"We had more time to correct the mistakes we've made,\" Caspers said. \"These past couple of practices, we haven't missed a beat. We've jumped right back in and had some productive periods. I'm confident in how we're playing now.\" \nStanford rushed for only 85 yards against Northwestern, but is the No. 4 rushing team in the Pac-12. The top two ranked rush teams -- Oregon and Arizona -- have played one more game than the Cardinal. \n\"We've made a lot of steps since our loss,\" Caspers said. \"We harp on getting better. Our coach tells us to celebrate each victory, but keep improving on our mistakes. We've done a good job of visualizing our mistakes and fixing the issues.\" \nCaspers occasionally fills in at center, taking center snaps in short-yardage situations after starting center Graham Shuler got \"rolled up\" against Northwestern. \n\"I've been happy to take over,\" Caspers said. \"It's a fun position to play.\" Advertisement \n\"Johnny played well last year, but had a lot of room for improvement,\" Stanford coach David Shaw said. \"He would say the same thing. Both he and Graham Shuler raised their level. Johnny is a physical guy, very smart. He can play center, does a great job as a puller. He is much better in pass protection than he was last year. I'm excited about the growth he has made.\" \nJohnny McCool Caspers was born in Glen Ellyn, Ill., located 25 miles west of Chicago. \n\"My middle name is my mother's maiden name,\" Caspers said. \"A number of kids in the family were given that as their middle name.\" \nAs for the unique last name of Caspers? \n\"I got kidded a lot when I was younger, but not so much lately,\" Caspers said. \"Lately, they think it's a weird Facebook name. No, it's my actual name.\" \nCaspers prepped at Glenbard West High in Glen Ellyn, a school that has produced several notable alumni -- musician/songwriter Laurie Anderson, NFL defensive back Matt Bowen, Olympic speed skater Diane Holum, who won gold and silver medals in 1972 after capturing silver and bronze in 1968, and Indy car driver Bobby Rahal -- to name a handful. \nThe 6-foot-4, 300-pound Caspers may join Bowen and San Diego Chargers offensive lineman Chris Watt as Glenbard West grads to make it to the NFL. If Caspers doesn't, he has a backup plan. Caspers, twice named the all-Pac-12 All-Academic second team, is an earth systems major. \n\"My focus is on sustainable food and agriculture,\" Caspers said. \"At some point, I'd like to get into farming, maybe work for the government in terms of agriculture.\" \nCaspers did some research over the summer at the Stanford Educational Farm. \n\"The goal was to take different waste streams on campus,\" Caspers said. \"I took horse manure from the equestrian center near Red Barn and coffee grounds from dining halls on campus. I composted them using worms to try and create a soil aggregate that can be used for the Educational Farm. It's on a small scale, but I was trying to create a more interconnected system that is cheaper. I had to do a lot of laundry.\" \nNo one knows what is in Caspers' future, but perhaps he'll one day link up with Glenbard West alum Phil Vischer (class of '84), author, actor and puppeteer who co-founded \"Veggie Tales.\" \nEmail John Reid at jreid@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at twitter.com/dailynewsjohn .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:33:47.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
