Just don't expect a wild makeover from the 2015 club. \n\"I know what we're capable of,\" said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, following his club's 3-0 loss to Houston in Tuesday night's AL wild-card game. \nThat quiet exit at Yankee Stadium from the 2015 season was reflective of a club that had stumbled badly since mid-August. \nThe Yankees were vulnerable to any left-handed pitching and compromised by injury. Certain key players underperformed and looked spent in the second half. \nBut the core of a club that led the AL East by 7 1/2 games in late July will remain largely intact. \n\"Do I recognize that we have to find ways to improve ourselves at the same time and continue to find more weapons for [manager] Joe Girardi to utilize? The answer to that is yes,\" Cashman said. \"The team we finished with wasn't, I don't think, reflective of what our capabilities were.\" \nCashman pointed to Mark Teixeira's season-ending leg fracture, initially misdiagnosed as a bone bruise, as a key blow – altering a lineup that lost 10 of its last 15 games against lefty starters. \nStarter Nathan Eovaldi, a 14-game winner, was lost to an elbow issue in early September, moving Adam Warren back into the rotation and subtracting from a tiring bullpen. \nAnd, of course, the Blue Jays traded for David Price and watched as their stacked lineup lit up scoreboards nightly. \nThe Yanks could use another impact starter, preferably a lefty, and Price will be a prominent free agent next month. But they've shown no inclination to throw more than $100 million at veteran starters after having sat out the bidding for Max Scherzer last winter. \nWould they take a shot at a younger ace if Zack Greinke opts out of his contract to become a free agent? Notably, Jordan Zimmerman, Johnny Cueto and Marco Estrada are eligible for free agency, as are Doug Fister, Mike Leake, Mat Latos, Hisashi Iwakuma and Scott Kazmir. \nLast year, the Yankees moved creatively in trades to land Eovaldi and shortstop Didi Gregorius. \nThey could try to go the same route for a starter, such as San Diego's Andrew Cashner or the Mets' Jon Niese. Or they could double down on their bullpen strength by inquiring again about San Diego's Craig Kimbrel or Cincinnati's Aroldis Chapman. \nBut Cashman has held tightly onto prospects Luis Severino, Greg Bird, Aaron Judge, Jorge Mateo and Gary Sanchez — players he sees as part of the new core. \nBrett Gardner might be best well-priced, big-league trade chip on the Yanks, with $38 million guaranteed through 2018. And yet, the Yanks still believe in the Jacoby Ellsbury-Gardner dynamic atop their lineup, despite how badly both faded in the second half. \nWith highly paid vets locked into the outfield, infield and catcher positions, Cashman's primary option is to strengthen his reserves; the Yanks seem unlikely to chase the big free agent bats of Yoenis Cespedes, Justin Upton and Jason Heyward. \nAs a free agent, Ben Zobrist could provide defensive versatility and right-handed punch. For now, the Yanks have a second base platoon of Dustin Ackley and Rob Refsnyder, but it's probably the one position they could explore improving. \nAnd the work begins now. \n\"There were periods of time this year when this team looked like it had a chance to do some serious damage in October,\" Cashman said. \"But that team that we saw earlier wasn't the team that finished.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:50:50.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
