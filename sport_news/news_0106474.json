Barrett help Ohio State hit its next gear?", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Ohio State was supposed to be historically good, the first unanimous preseason No. 1 in the 65-year history of the Associated Press college football poll.\nInstead of dominant, the top-ranked Buckeyes have been underwhelming. The defending national champions are undefeated yet far from convincing, winning by just a touchdown over Northern Illinois and Indiana before struggling with woeful Maryland.\nSo, after another ragged start last Saturday, this time against mediocre Penn State, Urban Meyer pulled his trump card: He replaced struggling starter Cardale Jones with J.T. Barrett for Saturday’s matchup at Rutgers with upcoming showdowns against Michigan State and Michigan looming in November.\n“J.T. has earned the right to start Saturday at Rutgers, just [based on] sheer production,” Meyer said this week on the Big Ten coaches’ conference call. “It was a difficult decision, but the red-zone production and third-down production were the two areas that made the difference.”\nIn limited duty this season, Barrett has been impressive, throwing for four touchdowns and running for five. He was particularly effective in last Saturday’s 38-10 rout of Penn State, accounting for four of the Buckeyes’ five touchdowns in relief. Jones has thrown just seven touchdowns and five interceptions, while completing only 62 percent of his passes.\nIt was easy to forget how dynamic Barrett was in relief of Braxton Miller last year, because it was Jones who led Ohio State (7-0) to the national title, beating Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game and Alabama and Oregon in the inaugural playoff. Before fracturing his ankle in the regular-season finale against Michigan, leading the Buckeyes to an 11-1 record as a starter and setting school single-season records for total touchdowns (45), total yards (3,772) and passing touchdowns (34) — good for a fifth-place finish in the Heisman Trophy voting.\nHis 45 total touchdowns also set a Big Ten single-season record, breaking the mark previously held by current New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees. Meyer now sees a different Barrett from the one who couldn’t practice in the spring and was still rusty in the summer.\nHis leadership qualities have remained a constant. He gave players pregame speeches last year when he was injured and was often seen this season congratulating the offensive line after drives despite being on the bench.\n“J.T. is one of those guys where he grabs everybody’s attention when he’s on the field,” tight end Nick Vannett told reporters this week . “He just takes control of the whole situation, whatever is going on out there on the field. Everybody is listening to what he says, and when you’ve got somebody like that at quarterback, it definitely gives you confidence as an offensive unit.\n“That’s his show when he’s out there. He’s a true field general.”\nIt’s not as if Ohio State has been dominant in every area except quarterback. The defense has battled consistency issues, and running back Ezekiel Elliott hasn’t been quite the dynamic playmaker he was late last season. Meyer hopes the blowout of Penn State was an indication of the direction his team is headed, especially the 315 rushing yards. He’ll find out more Saturday night against Rutgers, which has been very tough at home, nearly upsetting Michigan State and coming off a huge comeback win at Indiana.\n“I think we have very good personnel, I think we have very good coaches — we [need] to put it all together,” Meyer said. “What’s next is a complete game, a dominant performance. We haven’t had that yet.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under cardale jones ,  j.t. barrett ,  ohio state buckeyes ,  rutgers scarlet knights ,  urban meyer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:10:40.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
