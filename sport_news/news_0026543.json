He is in his sixth season with the Mean Green and finished with a 2-3 record in his last stint leading the program.\nUNT athletic director Rick Villarreal said late Saturday night that he would meet with the Mean Green's staff on Sunday morning to establish new roles for the remainder of the season.\nCanales will hold a news conference on Monday morning in his first official appearance in his second stint as UNT's interim head coach.\nMcCarney expressed confidence in his staff and its ability to lead the program after being dismissed by Villarreal following a devastating 66-7 loss to Portland State on homecoming that dropped the Mean Green to 0-5 this season.\n\"I have a phenomenal staff,\" McCarney said. \"I know it doesn't look like it today, but I have really phenomenal people. I have the utmost respect for them.\"\nCanales and the rest of UNT's remaining coaches face a daunting task after one of the toughest nights in recent program history.\nThe Mean Green must regroup during a short week before taking on red-hot Western Kentucky in a nationally televised game at Apogee Stadium on Thursday night. The Hilltoppers are 5-1 and received votes in this week's Associated Press Top 25 poll.\nUNT will then play four of its next five games on the road.\n\"It's going to be really tough because we turn around and play on Thursday, but the coaches will prepare our team and have us ready to go,\" Villarreal said.\nWhile UNT's players and coaches turn their attention to the Hilltoppers and the rest of the season, Villarreal will focus on finding McCarney's replacement. Villarreal didn't offer a timeline for finding a new coach but said UNT officials would begin a national search immediately.\nUNT's situation has changed dramatically since McCarney was hired before the 2011 season. The school opened $78 million Apogee Stadium in 2011 and two years later moved from the Sun Belt to Conference USA, a more regionally friendly league.\nDespite those improvements, UNT has one winning season in its last 10 and is on its way to posting a second straight losing campaign.\n\"We have great facilities and the structure to bring people in who will do a good job,\" Villarreal said.\nUNT thought it was in position to capitalize after beating UNLV in the 2013 Heart of Dallas Bowl but saw its run of success quickly end.\nBoth McCarney and Villarreal expressed shock that UNT's fortunes turned south so quickly.\n\"I don't think there was any one reason we couldn't sustain it,\" McCarney said. \"When you come up short like we did today and have the start we had this season, it's disheartening because I see how hard everyone has worked.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-10-11T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:18:24.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
