After deviating from the track, Rosberg was able to use strategy to get back on the race track, passing Sebastian Vettel to acquire second place.   \nBritish world champion, Lewis Hamilton, earned his 18 th title this year after winning the Japanese Formula 1 Grand Prix. \nThis puts Hamilton closer to keeping his title, with only five races remaining in the Grand Prix. His main rival is Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg, who has three titles, along with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel. \nThis marks Hamilton’s second title in a row on the Suzuka Circuit, and his third at the Japan Grand Prix. He first won the title in 2007 on the Fuji Speedway. As this is his 41 st victory, Hamilton’s win tally now matches that of former world champion Ayrton Senna. \nAlthough Hamilton was in second place in the beginning of the race, he ultimately beat Rosberg, arriving at first place. The world champion was able to widen the gap when he needed to, unlike his performance during his last race in Singapore, in which he withdrew at the last round. \nHamilton reached the finish line with a time of 1:28:07.19. After deviating from the track, Rosberg was able to use strategy to get back on the race track, passing Sebastian Vettel to acquire second place. \nVettel tried to make a comeback in the final lap, and reduced the time difference between him and Nico Rosberg to 1.8 seconds, but he did not have enough speed to overcome him, leaving him in third place. \nIn the fourth place came Finnish Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen, 33.76 seconds after Hamilton, while Valtteri Bottas, Williams Martini racing driver, came in fifth place with a 36.76 second difference between him and Hamilton. \nThe performance of McLaren-Honda was modest in Honda’s homeland, as the car engine’s weakness was obvious, and the McLaren team, made up of Spanish driver Fernando Alonso and his British partner Jenson Button, were easily surpassed. Alonso came in the 11 th place while Button came in 16 th place. \nThe top 10 rankings came as follows: Pos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:14:51.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
