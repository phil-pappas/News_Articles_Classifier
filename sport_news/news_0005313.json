Shea/Getty Images Ryan Mallett missed his team's flight to Miami. Houston Texans quarterback Ryan Mallett reportedly missed his team’s flight to Miami this week to face the Dolphins.\nAdChoices John McClain of the Houston Chronicle reports that Mallett had to fly commercial to meet up with his team in South Florida.\nTexans QB Ryan Mallett missed team charter and had to fly commercial to Dolphins game. I can imagine Bill OBrien reaction.\n— John McClain (@McClain_on_NFL) October 25, 2015 McClain went on to speculate that Texans coach Bill O’Brien would probably cut Mallett on the spot if second-year quarterback Tom Savage wasn’t on injured reserve. Mallett also missed a practice during training camp and offered an incredibly lame excuse .\nMallett was benched during a Week 5 loss to the Indianapolis Colts after he briefly left with an injury and Brian Hoyer gave Houston’s offense a spark. His body language after being yanked was very childish, and O’Brien has to be growing tired of his antics.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/McClain_on_NFL/status/658302210426671104", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/ryan-mallett-missed-texans-practice-oversleeping/271515", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/ryan-mallett-body-language-benched/277232"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:05:03.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
