It hasn’t snowed at the pack station yet, but Thursday afternoon it was starting to rain, one of the caretakers said. “We closed Columbus Day, Oct. 12, like we do every year,” Joyce Holliday, 65, said in a phone interview. “Dardanelle closed Oct. 1 I think.” That means the last stop for refreshments for anybody driving east over Sonora Pass before snow closes it for the winter is Strawberry General Store or Strawberry Inn just outside Pinecrest. The last gas for people driving over the pass to Bridgeport is in Cold Springs, about 11 miles east of Mi-Wuk Village. “Oh my god, it just started raining,” Holliday said just after 3 p.m. “The last snow up here was in May. We’ll be staying at least through the first snow.” Holliday said she and other caretakers have snowmobiles, so people can stay through the winter. She also said some retired San Francisco PD officers are staying at Kennedy Meadows right now. Kennedy Meadows, a gateway to high granite alpine country in the Emigrant Wilderness and the north reaches of Yosemite National Park, is around 6,500 feet in elevation and 57 miles east of Sonora. Sonora Pass, at 9,624 feet, is 65 miles east of Sonora. Bridgeport, elevation 6,463 feet, is about 97 miles east of Sonora, past the 108 junction with Highway 395. Holliday said this will be the start of her seventh winter at Kennedy Meadows. When the first heavy snow comes, that’s when she calls Caltrans and prepares to head down out of the mountains. “They close the gate at Eagle Meadows and send a plow down,” Holliday said. “We pack up and follow the plow tracks if there are any. We chain up and slip and slide out of here. “It normally takes me 45 minutes to get to Cold Springs,” Holliday said. “In the snow it can take two and a half hours. It can be scary in places.” The latest Holliday can remember Sonora Pass clear in winter was three years ago when it stayed open until Jan. 29. “It hadn’t been open on New Year’s Day since 1938,” Holliday said. “How about that?” She hasn’t seen any bears yet, but she expects to. “They’ll come down when everybody leaves and it gets quiet,” Holliday said. “They’ll probably be here in a couple weeks.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:18:16.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
