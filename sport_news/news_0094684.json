Chinese swimming team leader Xu Qi revealed this week that the team is targeting at even a better performance for next year. \n“We have put up a banner at our training center that reads “Miracle in London, Glory in Rio.” We hope our performance will surpass that in London,” Xu said at a signing ceremony in Shanghai to mark the collaboration between his team and web portal NetEase (163.com). \nNetEase has reportedly invested more than 30 million yuan (US$4.7 million) in a five-year deal to become the swimming team’s sponsor, and will cover the athletes’ training, competition and stay in Rio during next year’s Olympics. Red-hot world champion Ning Zetao has also become NetEase’s image ambassador. \nNing’s stunning victory in the men’s 100-meter freestyle at the world championships in Kazan, Russia, in August, as well as his sunny disposition, have made him a new national idol as well as a popular target for commercial sponsors. However, according to the team’s regulation, all its athletes should get prior approval before getting involved in advertising or commercial activities. The team will also get a share in athletes’ commercial income. \n“The athletes’ sports values can be transformed into social or economic values if we handle it properly,” said Wang Lusheng, director of the Chinese swimming team management center. “If it’s not handled well, it can lead to mutual damage.” \nWang revealed that the has already completed its internal Olympic selection work, and will soon start preparations for next year’s Games. \nOlympic champion Ye Shiwen also attended the signing ceremony. The winner of the women’s 400 and 200 individual medley in London suffered an ankle surgery in August. \n“After the recovery procedure, I’ll take part in rigorous training, and will hopefully reach my competitive form by next April,” the 19-year-old said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:42:22.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
