I don't know about theirs,” Kearse said. “It wasn't too chippy from them. I don't know if the scoreboard got to them or if they were just scared, but there wasn't too much coming from their players.” \nKearse said he wasn’t scared about talking a little trash. \n“When I said it, I ultimately knew we would get the last word because of the way we prepared throughout the week,” he said. “We had an extra week to prepare and it just paid off for us. When I talked trash I knew my guys would back me up and that we would back it up.” \nHowever, the Tigers are fully focused on Georgia Tech and Kearse said he is ready for more doubters to pop up this week. \n“Coming into this week, we are preparing like it's a new season,” he said. “We are coming into this week to put in a game plan to beat Georgia Tech and that is all it is.

People will always have their opinion. People will think we don't have a good team so we have to go out there and prove it.” \nHe ended by saying he wouldn’t have talked if he didn’t feel disrespected by the Irish players. \n“Honestly, I wouldn't have said anything about Notre Dame if they wouldn't have been talking on Twitter,” he said. “I just felt like they were talking and that was a sign of disrespect to me and I don't like being disrespected. I said what I had to say and did what I had to do. We just know Georgia Tech is a good team and we have to come in and have a good week of practice to pull this victory off. I have respect for them. They have a great team and they have a great coach and we will do what we have to do to go out there and pull off the W” \nOTHER QUOTES \nKEARSE \nOn the crowd \n“The crowd was ridiculous last Saturday. They did their job and we did our job. There was 82,000 in the rain getting soaked. I can’t say enough about our fans. I love our fans. They (Notre Dame) had delay of game penalties and that was due to our crowd. I hope they keep it up.” \nOn head coach Dabo Swinney Dabo Swinney View Full Profile ’s dance moves “He is getting it together. It's better than it was last year.
