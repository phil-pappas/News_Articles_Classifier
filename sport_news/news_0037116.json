Our football development activities across the globe continue apace.\"\nHayatou, who has been president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) since 1988, described FIFA's situation as \"unprecedented.\"\n“But we remain focused on the necessary reform process, the Presidential election and on supporting the current investigations,\" he said.\n\"To restore public trust is a crucial objective. It is essential that FIFA carries on its mission of developing the game and staging international tournaments.”\n(Writing by Brian Homewood in Nyon, Switzerland; Editing by Hugh Lawson )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:56:39.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
