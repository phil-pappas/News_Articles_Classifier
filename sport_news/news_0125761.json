He has not commented to The News. It's believed the sides are trying to see if there's a fit for him to stay on in some capacity.\nBaligian is a familiar voice to Detroit sports fans, especially for his work on WDFN 1130, where he hosted several shows — including a highly rated show with Tom \"Killer\" Kowalski.\nKowalski, the longtime Lions beat writer for what now is MLive, passed away suddenly, in August 2011, and Baligian decided he didn't want to continue without him.\nInstead, Baligian began doing a show out of his Metro Detroit home for 96.1 in Grand Rapids.\nBaligian has been filling in on 105.1 this week, a sign of things to come.\nIt's believed he will do his show solo, with an expanded sidekick role for Tom Mazawey. Jake Chapman could appear regularly on the show, on days he's not tied up with Pistons obligations.\ntpaul@detroitnews.com\ntwitter.com/tonypaul1984", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:30:00.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
