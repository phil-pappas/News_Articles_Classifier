(Photo: Ben Twingley) 17 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWelp... I guess I'll admit I got a little cocky after beating all participants in Week 7. \nI had a decent week, missing two games in an eight-game slate. \nI missed Taylor County over Catholic, and like many of the 73 participants last week, I was heartbroken by Pensacola High's one-point loss to Arnold. \nSix participants beat me, but it was only Juliet Wingate who showed an outstanding 8-0 week. \nFittingly so, Wingate won the raffle for the weekly grand prize (#BeatBrian t-shirt, tervis tumbler, $25 gift card). \nFour other winners won the drawing for a one of a kind, Andy Marlette custom-designed #BeatBrian shirt â€” congratulations to Darryl Randolph, Raymond Stewart, Brandon Moberly and Wayne Rushing. \nWinners are welcome to come by the Pensacola News Journal (2 North Palafox Street) beginning Wednesday to claim their prizes. \nHard to believe Week 9 is already here, so make sure you get to www.pnj.com/BeatBrian before 5 p.m. Thursday to sign up for this week's competition. \nIt feels like nearly everyone is on the road, or off this week as there are just three games in town this Friday night. \nThe Pine Forest will get their shot at the prestigious Niceville Eagles, which should provide a great test before the District 1-6A championship game vs. Tate the following week. \nWest Florida will seek to keep it going in District 1-5A competition after knocking off undefeated Bay last Friday. \nHere are the games for Week 9: \nFriday, Oct. 23 \nJay at Rocky Bayou Christian, 7 p.m. \nNorthview at Walton, 7 p.m. \nWest Florida at Arnold, 7 p.m. \nTate at Choctaw, 7 p.m. \nMosley at PHS, 7:30 p.m. \nWashington at Catholic, 7:30 p.m. \nNiceville at Pine Forest, 7:30 p.m. \nBye: Escambia, Gulf Breeze, Milton, Navarre, Pace 17 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1RSLgNd TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:11:11.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
