The team was called out a couple of times last night to rescue four stranded hikers.\nTwo people got stuck on Grouse Mountain, while another pair got lost in the Lynn Headwaters area.\nJim Loree with the team says the couple on Grouse were students from Japan that underestimated the trail. “They were definitely not prepared. They just basically had your typical street clothes and weren’t familiar with the terrain at all.”\nLoree says crews are exhausted after a record number of calls this year “I think we are at 118 calls now for the year after last night and we really do want to get the message out to please be prepared when you are going into the back-country. Research the area where you are going, take the proper equipment.”\nNone of the lost hikers were hurt.\nRelated Stories North Shore Rescue has another busy weekend, despite plea to hikers to be prepared North Shore Rescue's call for help reaches the BC Legislature Hikers | north shore mountains | North Shore Rescue | record | stranded", "external_links": ["http://www.northshorerescue.com/"], "published": "2015-10-04T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:31:53.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
