The impasse continues. The October 1, 11:59 p.m. deadline for Tristan Thompson to sign a one-year qualifying offer with the Cleveland Cavaliers has passed .\nAdChoices He is still a restricted free agent. The Cavs can still offer him a contract, other teams can still offer him a contract, and the Cavs can still match any offer that he receives. The only real change is that the one-year, $6.8 million qualifying offer — after which Thompson would have been an unrestricted free agent — is no longer on the table.\nThis means that the negotiation is not over. For all we know, they may just be beginning. Or they might sign a deal Friday morning. Nobody really knows anything except Thompson’s agent Rich Paul and Cavs GM David Griffin.\nThe Cavs and Thompson had reportedly agreed on a five-year, $80 million deal on July 1; no dice. They reportedly agreed on a three-year, $53 million deal; incorrect. Word was that if Thompson took the qualifying offer, he would sign elsewhere — possibly Toronto — when he became an unrestricted free agent. Now that’s off the table, too.\nThompson has missed the first three days of training camp already. If he and the Cavs don’t strike a deal soon, we’ll have a holdout on our hands. The season tips off on October 27.\nHoldouts are fairly rare in the NBA, and Thompson’s would be the first for the Cavs since Anderson Varejao in 2007 . Varejao didn’t sign with the Cavs until December 4. He signed a three-year, $17 million offer sheet with the Charlotte then-Bobcats (now Hornets), which the Cavs matched.\nIn 82 games last year (15 starts), Thompson averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds (3.3 offensive) in 26.8 minutes per game. He shot 54.7 percent from the field, by far a career best. He finished fifth in the league in total offensive rebounds, fourth in offensive rebound percentage, and top 20 in total rebounds.\nHe played in all 20 Cavs playoff games, starting 15 after Kevin Love went down with a shoulder injury. He averaged 9.6 points and 10.8 rebounds (4.4 offensive) in 36.4 minutes, shooting nearly 56 percent.\nThe No. 4 overall pick in the 2011 draft, Thompson has played all 82 games and finished among the top five offensive rebounders in each of the past three seasons. He was the only Cavalier to play in every game last season.\nIf things go smoothly, he’ll play in every game this year, too. If not, the Cavs could be missing another body on opening night.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.waitingfornextyear.com/2015/08/nba-rumors-is-rich-paul-steering-tristan-thompson-toward-toronto-in-2016/", "http://www.waitingfornextyear.com/2015/07/cleveland-cavaliers-tristan-thompson-80-million-nba-free-agency/", "http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/10/anderson_varejao_tristan_thomp.html", "https://twitter.com/mcten/status/649796560130322432", "http://www.waitingfornextyear.com/2015/09/disputed-report-tristan-thompson-signs-three-year-53-million-deal/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:17:37.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
