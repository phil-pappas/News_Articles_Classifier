Even on opening day, Bit House — which took over a historical building in the buzzing central eastside restaurant district — felt not like a new bar, but the best long-time Portland watering hole that you hadn't yet discovered.\nA visit two months later confirmed our suspicions, and Bit House's strengths: Warm, welcoming decor, superlative hospitality, good music and a creative drink menu that yielded superior beverages. Bit House Saloon proved our easy choice for Portland's best new bar.\nPerhaps most striking, Bit House feels like a fanciful rejection of a craft cocktail movement that had become too self-serious. You know, those well-meaning but ponderous bars with terse, we-know-what's-best-for-you drink lists, a narrow selection that too often plays to a brown-and-bitter palate geared to what's preferred by bartenders, not their customers. Thanks, but we'll pass on that quaff of Fernet, chamomile shrub and smoked bitters.\nJesse Card, bar manager at Bit House, shows he's the master of this high-low art, balancing craft cocktail refinement with dive bar joie de vivre. Here, there's room for single barrel spirits and machines that churn out adult slushies, classics like Manhattans and Old Fashioneds offered alongside casual sippers on tap, a one-buck pony of Miller High Life and a sherry program, all served up in an atmosphere of spirituous joy rather than somber reverence. You can have your boozy popsicle and eat it, too.\nWe had no doubt the Bit House team could knock the signature cocktails out of the park, but quirky drinks can be harder to pull off. Luckily, the banana colada arrived creamy and rum-forward rather than saccharine and headache-inducing. Cocktails on draft can lack balance because of the technical challenges, but several hit the spot on a hot day, from a refreshing blueberry bramble with gin, Oregon berries and a mountain of crushed ice, to a cooler referred to as a tiki drink made with vodka (bartenders, it's not a scary word!), accented with watermelon, falernum, lemon and pineapple gomme syrup. Garnishes were not neglected. A mint sprig was spritzed with aerosolized absinthe and dusted with powdered sugar.\nCard got a chance to draft a blueprint of sorts while working at the Knock Back on Northeast Alberta Street, a rollicking bar that appeared in last year's top 10 list. Brought in by Robert Kowalski and Jayson Criswell, whose rehab projects include Southeast Porland's Lutz Tavern, Card has plenty of help with a team of bartenders who have put in the hard hours at bars such as Teardrop Cocktail Lounge and Raven & Rose, including Chauncey Roach of the Fireside and Ración. From the kitchen side, you can come early for happy hour nibbles like biscuits with butter and radishes or make a dinner out of their twists on pub fare, which include an elk burger, a rabbit hand pie and popcorn-crusted Rocky Mountain Oysters (make sure to Google it first if you're in the dark).\nThe former home of East Bank Saloon offered the perfect space for these bartenders to show off their creativity — a building that dates back to 1896 and has played host to a number of businesses over the decades. Even with a makeover from Elk Collective, the design team behind Multnomah Whiskey Library, you can feel the history in the brick walls and accents that remained, such as chandeliers and sconces. During our first visit, an old phone booth got a 21st century application as one bar-goer posed inside for a selfie.\nThe saloon, at the corner of Southeast Grand Avenue and Morrison Street, offers an array of spaces to fit your mood: a lively bar with comfy chairs tucked in the corners, a larger area good for groups, an intimate side room perfect for hiding out, a patio for those warmer days before winter sets in. It's a setting that encourages you to relax a while, though you may be tempted to explore the bustling neighborhood.\nThe central eastside may be Portland's hottest district for food and drink, with new places popping up regularly. While Bit House is a cocktail destination, blocks away the Loyal Legion , also making our top 12 list of new bars , draws masses of beer lovers. Across the street from Bit House, you'll find hipster hangout Dig a Pony and Kachka, our 2015 Rising Star restaurant and a wonderland for vodka enthusiasts. With an easy walk you can also find Trifecta Tavern, Rum Club, Slow Bar and Cooper's Hall.\nBit House may be a newcomer to the neighborhood, but it feels like it's always been here.\nOrder this: If you're interested in checking out their single barrel collection in a cocktail, go for the Bit House Manhattan (with Weller Special Reserve) or Bit House Old Fashioned (Buffalo Trace). Or try them out on their own in a flight.\n727 S.E.
