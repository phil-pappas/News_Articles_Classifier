Grave rushed for 152 yards and scored four TDs as the Patriots improved to 5-2 on the season. \nWAYNE - The push is on. \nFor the Wayne Hills football team, last Saturday's 44-2 win over Teaneck may have improved the team's record to 5-2 and snapped a two-game losing streak, but head coach Wayne Demikoff knows the next couple of weeks will pretty much determine the course of the team's season, and ultimate success. \nWayne Hills will visit Paramus on Friday night, Oct. 23, in a key Big North Conference game starting at 7 p.m. Paramus has won the last three meetings against Wayne Hills, but the Patriots will be considered a favorite this year against a young, but well-coached group of Spartans, who will take a 3-3 mark into the game. \nThis week's game is the last for Wayne Hills, when it comes to playoff seeding. The Patriots have all but clinched a berth in the NJSIAA tournament next month, but a win on Friday is important toward gaining a better seed. \nFollowing Friday's game, Wayne Hills will get a week off before resuming its season on Nov. 7 at Wayne Valley in a regular-season finale that promises to be electric. \nWayne Hills was considered a big favorite in last Saturday's game against winless Teaneck and the Patriots took control quickly, leading 23-0 after one quarter and 30-2 by halftime. \nJunior tailback Luca Grave rushed for 152 yards on 13 carries and scored four touchdowns to lead the Patriots offense. A year ago, Grave set a new school record when he rushed for over 300 yards in a game against Teaneck. \nVincent LoVerde and Tom Skiba also scored touchdowns for Wayne Hills and Dario Simi continued his outstanding work as the team's place kicker, converting all six of his point-after kicks. \nJoe Kenny's dominance on defense has been noteworthy. The senior had five tackles and two sacks last Saturday, while LoVerde had four tackles and an interception. \nDemikoff was happy to see his team get back on the winning track. \n\"We wanted to get started early, so I was happy there,\" said Demikoff. \"We got the job done and our kids played pretty crisply for most of the first half. But like I told them afterward, we're still a 5-5 team until I tell them otherwise. If we get a win this Friday, then I won't be telling them that anymore.\" \nDemikoff was referring to Wayne Hills' record the past two seasons when the Patriots finished 5-5 in 2013 and 2014. Last year's team failed to qualify for the playoffs, marking the first time that happened at Wayne Hills in 20 years. Last Saturday's win pretty much assured the Patriots a berth in this year's postseason. \n\"We'll get a very good test on Friday, at Paramus,\" said Demikoff. \"(Paramus head coach) Dan (Sabella) is one of the best coaches out there. He does a great job, every year, in getting that team ready. They've had some big injuries to their quarterbacks this year, but Paramus keeps rolling out good players and we're well aware of that. They've beaten us the past three years and our kids know that a win here will be big for a sixth victory, as well as defeating a quality program.\" \nThe bye week after Friday should also help the Patriots for a stretch run. Wayne Hills normally doesn't have a bye week during the season, but since the team opened on 'zero' week in North Carolina, they'll get some time before preparing for Wayne Valley. \n\"At this time of the year, you can see where the kids are feeling the effects of a long season,\" said Demikoff. \"I think the bye will be good for us, especially with Wayne Valley coming up on our schedule, followed by the playoffs. We'd like to think we have five games left on our schedule. I think this team has it in itself to make a push deep into the playoffs, but it has to start with a big effort this Friday.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:10:06.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
