A victory would also help the lefty and his Toronto Blue Jays from falling into a 2-nothing hole in the American League Championship series against the Kansas City Royals. \nThe Jays -- the top scoring team in baseball would give Price a lead -- already up a run in the sixth Edwin Encarnacion would hit one through the left side and that is able to score a run.The Bluebirds are able to add to that as Troy Tulowitzki is able to lash one into right out of the reach of Alex Rios and the Jays are now in front by three.Price would be in a groove as he gets Alcides Escobar to chase -- and the visitors are in control.But the Royals start to chip away in the seventh --- now down just a run, they Royals get to the Jays lefty --- Mike Moustakas rips one over the head of the second baseman and that brings in a run to tie it.K-C would not be done there -- a couple batters later Alex Gordon hits one into the outfield and that will bring in another run -- the home side is up 4-3 and the fans are loving it at Kaufmann stadium.That would chase Price from the game, but Kansas City would continue to add to the score -- former Jay Alex Rios gets one up the middle. K-C scores five runs in the seventh inning to win it 6-3 and take a 2-nothing series lead. \nIn the other game, the Mets draw first blood in the NLCS. Matt Harvey struck out 9 as the Metropolitans double up the Chicago Cubs and grab 1- nothing series lead.
