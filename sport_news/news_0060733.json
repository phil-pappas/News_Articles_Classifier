(Photo by David Banks/Getty Images) Going into the National League Championship Series, there was all sorts of speculation as to which Chicago Cubs player would replace Addison Russell on the team’s roster, and on Saturday morning, the decision was finally made. Outfielder Quintin Berry was added to the team’s 25-man roster after Russell was ruled out for the series with a hamstring injury that he suffered in Game 3 of the NLDS against the Cardinals. Berry will likely be used primarily as a pinch-runner, but he could feasibly be used as a defensive substitution if Chris Coghlan is used as a back-up infielder in Russell’s absence. Adding Berry to the roster seems to signal that the Cubs are making sure that they can generate runs in multiple ways. The team relied primarily on home runs to beat the Cardinals in four games, but with cold temperatures in the forecast for the first two games of the series, the team might have to get creative and manufacture runs instead against a tough Mets pitching staff. There was speculation that the team would make a straight infielder-for-infielder swap, with Jonathan Herrera getting the call to join the roster, and there was also talk that a player like Neil Ramirez or Jason Motte could add an extra arm to the bullpen, but the Cubs ultimately decided on adding Berry instead. Here is the full roster: Pitchers: Jake Arrieta, Trevor Cahill, Justin Grimm, Jason Hammel, Kyle Hendricks, Jon Lester, Clayton Richard, Fernando Rodney, Hector Rondon, Pedro Strop, Travis Wood Catchers: Miguel Montero, David Ross Infielders: Javier Baez, Kris Bryant, Starlin Castro, Tommy La Stella, Anthony Rizzo Outfielders: Quintin Berry, Chris Coghlan, Chris Denorfia, Dexter Fowler, Austin Jackson, Kyle Schwarber, Jorge Soler Leaving Russell off the roster does mean that he is ineligible for NLCS games, but he would be eligible to return for the World Series if the Cubs advance.
