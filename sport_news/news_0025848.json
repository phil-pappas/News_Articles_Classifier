According to Maggie Willems, quite a bit. \n“To play with West Delaware, you really have to play a near-perfect match,” said Willems, the volleyball coach at Mount Vernon. “The longer the match goes, the better they seem to get. Their setter (Carlee Ketchum) is wicked smart. So you have to play 25 points of nearly flawless volleyball to have a chance.” \nClass 4A top-ranked West Delaware (41-2) is the favorite as the Wamac Conference tournament moves to bracket play Tuesday at Marion High School. \nAll 16 Wamac teams will congregate at Marion, including eight in the championship bracket. Action starts at 4 p.m. \nWest Delaware won its pool Thursday, as did 3A No. 5 Mount Vernon (22-11), 4A No. 5 Marion (26-7) and 4A No. 13 Western Dubuque (20-11). \nThe Mustangs tripped 3A No. 6 Center Point-Urbana (27-6), which will face West Delaware in a quarterfinal match at 5 p.m. \n“That was an important win for us,” Willems said. “We’ve been battling injuries, so it’s remarkable how we have responded.” \nThe Wamac sent five teams to the state tournament last year. West Delaware was the 4A runner-up, and Solon beat Mount Vernon in the 3A final. If the league is down from that lofty perch this fall, it’s not by much. \n“CPU and Western Dubuque have gotten a lot better. They both have great size,” Willems said. “Marion is great, they have size and experience. \n“We feel good. We feel confident. We’re getting better at the right time of the year.” \nMount Vernon faces Clear Creek Amana (23-14) at 4 p.m. in the first round. Western Dubuque faces Dyersville Beckman (15-17) at 4; Marion meets Independence (20-12) at 5. \nSemifinals are scheduled for 6:30, the championship at 7:15. \nPOSTSEASON BEGINS IN 1A, 2A \nRegionals begin Tuesday in Class 2A and Class 1A, with a pair of area ranked teams in action. \nNorth Cedar (26-9), the 14th-ranked team in 2A, hosts Bellevue (3-18) at Clarence. Class 1A No. 9 Iowa Valley (22-8), the South Iowa Cedar League champion, faces Lynnville-Sully (10-8) at Marengo. \nBoth matches begin at 7 p.m. \nAmong area teams with first-round byes are 2A No. 4 West Branch and 1A No. 5 Springville. Both begin their postseason run next Tuesday. \nRegionals kick off next Monday in 3A, 4A and 5A. \nWAMAC CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT \nTuesday, at Marion High School \nQuarterfinals \nWest Delaware (41-2) vs. Center Point-Urbana (27-6), 5 p.m. \nMount Vernon (22-11) vs. Clear Creek Amana (23-14), 4 p.m. \nWestern Dubuque (20-11) vs. Dyersville Beckman (15-17), 4 p.m. \nMarion (26-7) vs. Independence (20-12), 5 p.m. \nSemifinals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:16:43.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
