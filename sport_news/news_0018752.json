The first-half rushing numbers against TCU were 28 for 165, and in the second half the Wildcats came out with an emphasis on the passing game, throwing 11 times with only one completion and one interception for a touchdown return while running five times in their first four series. \n“I think that was part of our adjustments,” Hubener said of the pass plays, many of them deep routes, “and it didn’t quite pan out how we anticipated. \n“We wanted to keep them on their heels. We were up 18 at the half and we wanted to stay aggressive and hopefully take them out of the ballgame and it didn’t pay off.” \nOn the Wildcats’ fifth possession of the second half they stayed entirely on the ground and put together a 10-play, 45-yard touchdown drive. That gave them a 42-31 lead with 12:21 left in the fourth quarter, but they managed only one field goal the rest of the way while TCU scored three touchdowns to post a 52-45 victory. \nHubener said regardless of what plays are called, it comes down to players executing. He completed only 13 of 33 passes for 157 yards against TCU, and he ran for 111 of K-State’s 228 rushing yards with Charles Jones picking up 75. \n“We try to be a balanced offense and that’s significant and important to us,” coach Bill Snyder said. “The first half we threw the ball around fine so we made some progress, but it dwindled in the second half, as did the run game. We have to continue to make improvement and be consistent.” \nFinding that balance — in play-calling and from the first half to the second — has been the focal point for the Wildcats (3-2, 0-2 Big 12) as they prepare to face No. 19 Oklahoma (4-1, 1-1) at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Snyder Family Stadium. \n“We’re looking at second-half performance, not just third quarter,” Snyder said. “That’s a major part of it, how we start the second half, and we’ve always looked at it. The last two ballgames isn’t the only time that we’ve had some difficulty in the second half for one reason or another. We’re not going to panic over it, but we’re doing as much research as we possibly can and is there anything that should be different than what we’re doing. \n“Part of it is a matter of emphasis, part of it is how we might approach any changes that we make in the second half. For the most part, and I know it sounds like a pat answer, but it’s a matter of execution as it relates to offense, defense and kicking game and coaching. I don’t think there’s anything mind-boggling that we come up with, at least we haven’t at this point.” \nKen Corbitt can be reached at (785) 295-1123 or ken.corbitt@cjonline.com .Follow Ken on Twitter @KenCorbitt .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:25:10.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
