That’s the one-year upward trek that Cedar Rapids Kennedy has taken. \nKennedy and Cedar Rapids Washington each climbed a notch in this week’s Class 4A rankings in the Gazette/KCRG/KGYM football poll, released Monday afternoon. \nWest Des Moines Dowling remains the top team, while Bettendorf is No. 2. Then it’s the Metro duo, both of which have clinched district championships, at 3 and 4. \nKennedy (8-0) wrapped up the District 5 title with a 21-7 win over Cedar Falls. The Cougars play at Waterloo West on Friday, and can put a bow on their first perfect regular season in school history. They were 3-7 last season. \nWashington (7-1) has won six straight games since a 28-24 loss to Kennedy in Week 2. The Warriors clinched the District 6 crown with a 39-20 win at Iowa City High last week, and are heavily favored to beat Burlington on Friday. \nThe Cougars and the Warriors moved up after West Des Moines Valley was upset by Ankeny Centennial, 16-14. Valley fell from third to seventh. \nPella remains a unanimous No. 1 in Class 3A. The Dutch are followed by West Delaware (a 13-9 victor over Independence) and Cedar Rapids Xavier (which rallied from a 28-point halftime deficit to beat Iowa City Regina, 38-35). \nDespite its loss, Regina stayed No. 1 in Class 1A. The Regals maintained seven of eight first-place votes; No. 2 Dike-New Hartford received the other. \nFor the third straight week, Albia and Spirit Lake share the No. 1 spot in Class 2A. Albia nabbed four first-place votes, Spirit Lake three. South Tama is No. 3 this week and plays at No. 5 Aplington-Parkersburg on Friday for the district crown. \nBGM and Newell-Fonda stay on top in Class A and 8-Player, respectively. \nThe final poll of the season will be released next Monday. \nGAZETTE/KCRG/KGYM FOOTBALL POLL \nCLASS 4A W-L Pts Pvs \n1.
