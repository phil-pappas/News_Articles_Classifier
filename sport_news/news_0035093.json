To learn more about the Pirates, and what challenges they present, we caught up with Nate Summers, who covers East Carolina football for the Daily Reflector , and asked him five questions to learn more about BYU's next opponent.\n1. Briefly recap ECU's season so far. The team incurred some tough losses to Florida and Navy, but rebounded nicely against VaTech and SMU .\nEast Carolina has been full of surprises in the first half of the season. After learning in the final week of the preseason they had lost starting quarterback Kurt Benkert for the year, the emergence of backups Blake Kemp and James Summers has become the story. ECU's near miss at Florida stands as the one that got away, but the Pirates played their best two games defensively the last two weeks and come to Provo with momentum.\n2. Talk about the Pirates' quarterback situation heading into Saturday's contest. Blake Kemp has seen most of the reps, but was replaced by James Summers last week. Who will the Cougars see starting on Saturday?\nBoth. It is a strange two-quarterback system so far. Don't expect to see Kemp and Summers alternating either during drives or even drive to drive, though that was how the ECU coaches initially tested it against Florida. In the last two games, Kemp has played the first quarter, Summers has entered in the second and not come out of the game until the final minutes.\nThe team says both QBs are roughly the same and have most of the same play calls, but Kemp is a more confident drop-back passer and Summers is a much better runner, seemingly the reason both have been kept in the fold.\n3. Talk about the rest of the offense. What type of system do the Pirates run and who are the primary playmakers?\nThe Pirates' spread offense is powered by the intermediate pass game, which is led by junior inside receiver Isaiah Jones and senior tight end Bryce Williams, both of whom are off to strong starts. That helps to make space for the outside receivers, led by sophomore playmaker Trevon Brown and junior Davon Grayson. The run game has struggled outside of the dynamic Summers.\n4. Same question on defense. What is the system and who are the primary playmakers?\nThe Pirates' 3-4 scheme is built around its linebackers. The defensive centerpiece is senior mike linebacker and leading tackler Zeek Bigger, but last week's rout of SMU was highlighted by OLBs Montese Overton (four sacks) and Yiannis Bowden (2.5 sacks). The trouble in the Pirates' recent history is in the secondary, where coordinator Rick Smith said the Pirates gave away three TDs to SMU last week. BYU could prove a tough assignment unless ECU can continue to generate a steady pass rush.\n5. How does East Carolina regard BYU as an opponent? What needs to happen for the Pirates to come away from Provo with a win?\nI think there is a healthy respect from the ECU side with regard to BYU's history and place in college football. But the Pirates have made their name by beating bigger opponents, and in that sense, BYU is just another one of those in a season in which they've already played in front of 88,000 in The Swamp and 50,000 in their own stadium. Simply put, if the Cougars can't contain Summers and ECU can get some third-down stops on defense, it could be anyone's game.\nEmail: bgurney@desnews.com\nTwitter: @BrandonCGurney", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://www.reflector.com/sports/ecu", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team73.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:39:13.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
