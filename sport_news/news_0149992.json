I've been waiting on this moment since I had my first surgery so I'm glad to be out there.\"\nRELATED: Auburn opens practice with renewed optimism\nAuburn head coach Bruce Pearl said Shamsid-Deen is \"close\" to 100 percent after missing the final 11 games of the 2014-15 season.\n\"He's under fire,\" Pearl said. \"It's real physical out there. I'll tell you, he's hit the floor about five or six times and gotten up and neither shoulder has come close to popping out, so that's a really good sign. I'm really not worried anymore.\"\nThe 5-foot-9, 175-pound junior averaged 6.1 points and 1.5 assists last season and played a vital role as a perimeter defender. He is expected to compete with Marshall transfer Kareem Canty at point guard, but could also see time as a shooting guard.\nRELATED: Pearl says Auburn's starting point guard job is 'wide open'\nShamsid-Deen says he's regained the 10 pounds he lost during his rehab and has added even more weight this summer. He's planning on putting his physicality to the test right off the bat.\n\"I'm not trying to wait for the first game to see how falling feels,\" he said. \"I'm trying to get all my banging and going to the pain and falling on the ground over with in practice so I'll be used to it by the time the games come around.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:16.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
