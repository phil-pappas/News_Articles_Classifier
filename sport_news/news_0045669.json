(Photo: Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images) \n1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh and Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald have steered away from describing their upcoming game as a defensive duel because, as they’ve both pointed out, winning games is about all phases.\nBut it’s difficult not to think when Michigan and Northwestern play on Saturday in Michigan Stadium it will be anything but a defensive challenge.\nAfter all, Northwestern ranks first nationally in scoring defense (7.0 points a game), while Michigan is No. 2 (7.6). Michigan is first in third-down percentage defense, while Northwestern is No. 2. And the Wolverines are ranked second in total defense (184.0 yards per game), while the Wildcats are No. 5 (247.4).\n“I’m not sure any coach looks at it that way,” Fitzgerald said Tuesday afternoon on the Big Ten call when asked if this will be a defensive slugfest.\nBoth defenses have experienced starters, for the most part.\n“When I look at overall as our team, there’s great chemistry there’s great brotherhood, love and trust within our program,” Fitzgerald said. “The guys really made an emphasis in the offseason starting in January to focus on what we can control. They were absolutely terrific all offseason, the accountability and leadership and that has permeated throughout our whole football team.”\nFitzgerald explained that something had shifted the last few seasons. He re-evaluated his coaching and the players re-evaluated how they were preparing\n“We are a little more veteran on the defensive side of the ball,” Fitzgerald said. “Up front, we played 11 defensive linemen last week. We’re playing a lot of guys, a lot of different talent and skill sets, but they’re playing hard for each other and playing really hard for our program. We felt like we kind of gave away what we value and who we were over the last few years, and we’ve kind of had a theme of having to go out there and fight to earn it every rep every day and that carries over to Saturdays every game.\n“This year, the No. 1 reason why we’re playing so many guys, the last two seasons, I was very critical of myself and very critical of our staff. We really felt like we did not do a good enough job of getting the next guy ready to play. It’s my fault, it’s my responsibility we did a lot of research on it in the offseason (about getting) more guys involved, especially early. It’s twofold — No. 1 it’s more guys feeling a part of it instead of becoming a comfortable (backup) and like, ‘Well I’m not going to play but I’m still riding the bus and eating a steak.’ The secondary part is some of your front-line guys, you’re taking a handful of reps off, and you take that over a 10-, 12-game schedule that when you get to November they’re going to be a little more fresh.”\nFitzgerald rattled off Michigan’s defensive two-deep, noting the number of upperclassmen but also pointing out safety Jabrill Peppers as a redshirt freshman.\n“Who’s a great player,” Fitzgerald said. “This is a veteran defense that was outstanding over the last few years and they’ve continued that on with a new defensive mindset, and a new scheme and it’s very impressive to watch.”\nWhy Fitzgerald went camping \nFitzgerald explained again during the Big Ten call why he accepted Harbaugh’s offer to speak at the Michigan camp this summer, reiterating what he had told The Detroit News that day before he flew back. He said he did it because it fit his schedule and he was able to get home to Chicago to watch his beloved Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup finals.\n“Any chance I get to send a message to young people about choice and the reality of life on and off the field, I’m honored to do that,” Fitzgerald said Tuesday.\nDuring the Big Ten kickoff in July, Fitzgerald said he had gotten to know Harbaugh when they were on the recruiting trails when Harbaugh was coaching Stanford.\n“I’ve got a ton of respect for not only the job he’s done as a coach but remember his playing ability and especially here as a Bears fan,” Fitzgerald said this summer. “How can you forget he was quarterback of the Bears?”\nConcern about paying players \nPerhaps in light of playing Northwestern on Saturday, Harbaugh was asked during the Big Ten call about paying players. Some Northwestern players were involved in an attempt to unionize, but that was rejected by the National Labor Relations Board.\nHarbaugh said he worries about taxing the student-athletes if they are paid.\n“The one thing they probably need to look at is, if they are paid something and they become employees that there would be a real chance that they would be taxed (and) that their scholarship would be taxed as a taxable benefit,” Harbaugh said. “I don’t know if they’ve really looked at that and wondered that they might not be better off in a situation that they have (now). That’s my question, really.\n“The youngsters may be in a worse position if they’re paid some amount of money and they become employees of the university. That as an employee you’re going to be taxed and that $65,000 scholarship would be taxed as a taxable benefit. They may be worse off. That’s my concern and my fear.”\nachengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:11:59.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
