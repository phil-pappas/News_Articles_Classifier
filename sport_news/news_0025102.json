But Hulk restored Zenit's lead before Danny completed the scoring on the counterattack, meaning Lyon can be eliminated from the tournament if it is beaten next time out.\nIt took just two minutes for Zenit to make the breakthrough as Oleg Shatov picked up a loose ball in the left of midfield and played to Dzyuba, who turned sharply on the edge of the box before slotting into the bottom right-hand corner.\nAt the other end, Zenit goalkeeper Mikhail Kerzhakov made a fine flying save to his right to keep out Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa's sweetly struck volley.\nIn a frantic spell Zenit should have been 2-0 up just shy of the half-hour mark. Hulk showed great feet in the area to find Dzyuba in plenty of space but the striker slipped at the crucial moment and shot high over the crossbar.\nSoon afterwards, Hulk forced a brilliant fingertip save from Anthony Lopes with a stinging 25-yard drive.\nHowever, Lyon started the second half well and were level in the 49th minute.\nMathieu Valbuena sprayed a brilliant ball out wide to Christophe Jallet on the right and he volleyed a first-time cross into the penalty area where Lacazette finished with a wonderful backheel flick.\nBut Lyon was level for just seven minutes as Hulk shrugged off a couple of challenges and burst forward before unleashing a wonderful left-foot shot from 30 yards that swerved into the left-hand corner for his third goal of the competition.\nShortly afterwards, Dzyuba should have put the game beyond doubt when he found a gaping hole in the Lyon defense only to lift his shot over Lopes and wide of the post.\nThe miss was almost punished when Samuel Umtiti's fierce long-range effort flew narrowly wide of the left-hand post.\nBut Zenit made sure eight minutes from the end. A swift counterattack led to Shatov playing in Danny to apply a simple finish in the area, and Ezequiel Garay thought he had added a fourth with a late header but he was flagged for offside.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:51:56.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
