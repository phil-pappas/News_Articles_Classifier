(AP) - Everett Golson is showing signs of being the quarterback Seminoles fans hoped when he transferred to Florida State over the summer. \nAfter a rough stretch early in the season, Golson is completing 67.2 percent of his passes for 1,449 yards, 11 touchdowns and no interceptions for the ninth-ranked Seminoles. It also marks the third time that a Golson-led team has started a season 6-0. \nCoach Jimbo Fisher and Golson’s teammates rave about his progress. \nAs far as a self-assessment from Golson, no one knows beyond the locker room. \nGolson hasn’t talked publicly since August, when he was battling Sean Maguire for the starting spot. \nThough the articulate, graduate student should have no problems expressing himself, Fisher said he’s kept him away from the media to “eliminate the clutter” and that it is what is best for Golson and the team. \n“It’s not an indictment on him. It’s not an indictment on (the media). It’s not an indictment on anything,” Fisher said. “There may be a time he does, but not right now.” \nOver the past two games, Golson has gone 51 of 71 for 663 yards and four touchdowns. His 372 yards last Saturday in a 41-21 win over Louisville marked his eighth 300-yard game (second at Florida State) and was the second-most yards of his career. \nHis next challenge is Saturday against 2-5 Georgia Tech. \nBut the biggest number that stands out for Golson is zero turnovers. \nGolson had 22 last season (14 interceptions, eight fumbles) which is why he was benched for Notre Dame’s bowl game and eventually transferred. \nNFL Network analyst Mike Mayock, who was NBC’s analyst for Notre Dame home games during Golson’s two years with the Fighting Irish, said Golson is more disciplined when it comes to ball security. \n“There were a couple times last season when he would spin out and put the ball on the ground to use as a brace,” Mayock said. “He’s also taking what the defense is giving him where last year he was trying to make every play a big one.” \nMost times that has been throwing to check down receivers instead of trying to go downfield. However, Golson has been in manageable down-and-distances whereas last season he faced plenty of third-and-longs. \nDuring last Saturday’s 41-21 win over Louisville, Golson checked down on the run and found Kermit Whitfield for a 70-yard touchdown that gave the Seminoles the lead for good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:40:40.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
