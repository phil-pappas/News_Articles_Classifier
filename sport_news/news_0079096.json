(Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Matt Pearce Contact Reporter \nFormer Laker and Clipper Lamar Odom was found unconscious in a Las Vegas-area brothel and taken to a hospital Tuesday afternoon, brothel owner Dennis Hof told The Times. \nA spokeswoman for the Nye County Sheriff’s Office confirmed an ambulance had been sent to Hof’s Love Ranch brothel near Las Vegas and that Odom had been treated by paramedics and stabilized before he was taken to the Desert View Hospital. \nOdom was initially going to be transported to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas by helicopter but because of his height he could not be transported by air. Instead he was transported to the Las Vegas hospital by ambulance. \nOdom told Hof on Saturday that he wanted to come out to Hof’s Love Ranch brothel near Las Vegas on Saturday, and Odom stayed in Hof’s home attached to the brothel, Hof told The Times. \nOdom “wanted to get away from everybody, wanted to have fun,” said Hof, who was in northern Nevada over the weekend. \nHof’s workers reported Odom had ordered a bottle of cognac over the weekend but had not finished it by Tuesday — a third of the bottle was still left, Hof said. \nOdom was also apparently in a “somber” mood Sunday, Hof said his workers told him. \n“Other than that, [he was in] good spirits, wanted to have a good time,” Hof said. \nOn Tuesday morning, Hof’s employees saw Odom at 6 a.m., and then two women at the brothel went to check on him at 3 p.m. and found him unconscious, Hof said. \nWhen they turned Odom on his side, “terrible stuff came out” of his mouth or nose, Hof said. \nHof’s employees said Odom appeared to be taking a lot of herbal Viagra, and they didn’t see him with illegal drugs, Hof said. \nHof said his brothel was a nice getaway from the media and for people to “be who they want to be as long as they want to be there.” \nAn employee from Odom’s management company was sent to pick up Odom’s backpack and cellphone, Hof said. \nFollow Matt Pearce on Twitter @mattdpearce \nALSO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:31:59.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
