After the past three seasons of records of 0-12, 1-11 and 3-9, that's something brand new. \nDon't mention it to Monken, though. He says, at his point, that's just pie in the sky. \n\"We have three wins,\" Monken said. \nAnd it takes six wins to be eligible for a bowl game. \nThe Golden Eagles have been placed in the picture for the R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl and the Gildan New Mexico Bowl, both of which will be played Dec. 19. \nMonken didn't have anything good to say about the people who are predicting bowl berths. \n\"It's the same people that projected we wouldn't be worth a ----,\" he said. \"So I don't get why it would matter if all of a sudden they think we'd go to a bowl. And next week we're not going to a bowl. And next week I could care less. We're at three. \n\"We're looking at four.\" \nSouthern Miss is 3-2 overall and 1-0 in Conference USA, with another C-USA game at 6 p.m. Friday at Marshall. \nThe Thundering Herd is 4-1 and 1-0. They won the Conference USA championship last season and the C-USA East Division title in 2013. \nKnock off Marshall, and you're a step closer to becoming the team Monken wants. \n\"I think it just says how far you've come,\" Monken said. \"That's really what it is. It's a barometer. If you want to be the best, you've got to go up against the best and see where you're at. \n\"They've set the bar the last couple years in building up to Doc's last few years where he's got all of his players. So that's really what it is. To see where you're at and to be a barometer for that.\" \n-- Southern Miss quarterback Nick Mullens was named Conference USA's Offensive Player of the Week on Monday. \nMullens completed 27 of 36 passes for 325 yards and four touchdowns against North Texas. He also ran for a touchdown. \nMullens was also named one of eight Manning Award Stars Monday. \n-- Monken said Monday that he is hoping that some of his injured players -- including linebacker Anthony Swain, defensive lineman Draper Riley and safeties Devonta Foster and Deshadrick Truly -- will be able to play against Marshall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:35:21.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
