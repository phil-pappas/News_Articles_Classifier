I can only talk about how motivated I am and if you could bottle that motivation and sell it you would probably go to jail,” he told reporters in 2012. \nThis will be music to Liverpool’s success-starved fans who hope Klopp can emulate his success in the Premier League. \nUltimate coach \nExuberant, explosive and witty, Klopp is every fan’s ultimate coach, a man who can find the connection and the right balance between players, supporters and the board of directors. \nA big motivator in the changing room, ‘Kloppo’, as he is called back home, is a strong supporter of high speed football. \nHe brought then-teenager Mario Goetze into the first team in 2010, bought Shinji Kagawa for 300,000 euros from Japan’s second division and turned a string of players, including Mats Hummels, Erik Durm, Kevin Grosskreutz and Roman Weidenfeller, into World Cup-winning Germany internationals. \nWith his trademark high pressing, quick counter-attacks and never-say-die approach, Dortmund took the Bundesliga and Europe by storm, snatching domestic supremacy from Bayern Munich and winning over millions of fans across the world as the club spread its commercial operations beyond Europe. \nIn the process, Dortmund won the Bundesliga in 2011 and again a year later when they also clinched the German Cup and Super Cup, before reaching the Champions League final in 2013, losing to their Bavarian rivals in the first all-German final of the competition. They won the Super Cup again in 2014. \nHaving spent his entire playing career at second-tier Mainz 05, Klopp took over the team in 2001 and led them into the Bundesliga in 2004 and even a 2005/06 UEFA Cup spot via the Fair Play draw before they were relegated in 2007. \nAfter failing to win promotion he left the following year in a tearful farewell attended by thousands of fans. \nEmotional outburst \nHis emotional outbursts on the touchline that have seen him banned and fined are as much a part of his character as the witty punchlines that can turn a run-of-the-mill Champions League news conference into memorable entertainment. \nLong considered a likely successor to Pep Guardiola at Bayern, he announced his resignation late last season, saying Dortmund needed a change after a disappointing campaign that saw them bottom of the table at the halfway mark. \n“I am—and that may come as a surprise to some—not stupid and I know when I have been lucky,” he once said, when asked about coaching at Dortmund. “Borussia have been a present.” \nLiverpool will now hope they are his next gift. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:05:11.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
