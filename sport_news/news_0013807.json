Rowling’s Harry Potter before Bloomsbury accepted it.\nApple founder Steve Jobs was fired from his own company.\nWalt Disney’s first company, Laugh-O-Grams, went bankrupt.\nThe road to success is rarely a smooth, unobstructed path. Instead, it’s usually a mixture of potholes and unanticipated detours.\nSometimes a journey is so rough, a particularly painful stretch can seem like the end of the road. Difficulties look like failure.\nBut history is replete with examples of people who found hope, even as others conceded defeat. The masterpiece is often found in the mess.\nSuccess always involves struggle. Nowhere is that more evident than sports.\nWhich is why it was curious that so many were critical of Utah coach Kyle Whittingham’s decision to call a risky play in the third quarter of the Utes game against Arizona State Saturday.\nWith a 14-13 lead, Utah’s Britain Covey caught the kickoff deep in the end zone and then he ran forward a few steps, threw an ugly pass to Bubba Poole. It was ruled an illegal forward pass and a safety for ASU. The Sun Devils' led 15-14 and suddenly momentum was on the side of the visiting team.\nCriticism was quick and cutting.\nStupid, arrogant and ill-timed were some of the kinder descriptions of the play. Whittingham defended his choice after the game.\n“We just didn’t execute,” he said. “It was an aggressive play and we wanted to keep the pedal down. If the throw had gotten there, it would have been a big play.”\nTo me it was no different than the fake punt he called in the Oregon game, which was lauded as brilliant. The only difference was the execution.\nEverybody talks about loving a coach with guts, with grit, with reckless abandon. Until, that is, the risk doesn’t yield the reward expected.\nBut even in failure, there is growth. And while many times coaches understand this process, fans – and sometimes administrators – do not.\nIf sports teach us anything, they teach perseverance. But how does one learn to endure difficulties, if there are none? How does one learn to overcome a mistake, if they’re never allowed to happen?\nI have a horse that likes to test me. Early in our relationship, I did everything in my power to avoid the tests. He spooked, so I limited what he was exposed to. He ran, so I never asked him to trot or canter. He bucked, so if he showed any sign of life or energy, I shut him down.\nAnd then one day a trainer said to me, “You’re punishing that horse for behavior he hasn’t yet exhibited. You have to let him misbehave if you want to correct the problems. You can’t fix the behaviors if you’re not willing to deal with them.”\nI was riding scared and the horse knew it. I didn’t know if I could handle the rough stuff, so I just did my best to never experience it. Unfortunately, my desire to avoid trouble led to a whole lot of bad training. It didn’t help my horse, and it certainly didn’t make me a better rider.\nIn my nearly two decades of covering sports, I’ve witnessed a lot of coaching styles and strategies.\nSometimes the coaches look a lot like me in those first few months of horseback riding. Others ride like my trainer, in eager anticipation of situations that will teach her something about the animals she loves.\nGuess which style tends to be more successful?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:05:25.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
