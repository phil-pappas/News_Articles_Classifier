He's one of them.\n\"We had a solitary fellow when (Tiger) Woods was going at his best. It's a group we're looking at now.\n\"They seem to be very friendly to each other. They all have similar styles.\"\nDay rode a hot streak in the leadup to the Deutsche Bank Championship, piling up wins at the Canadian Open, PGA Championship and The Barclays.\nBut he shuddered to a halt with a third-round 73 at TPC Boston and said he was \"cooked\" after signing off with a 69 on Monday.\nAfter winning the Masters and the U.S. Open, Spieth has also struggled since his runner-up finish behind Day at the PGA Championship and missed the cut at the Deutsche Bank.\nMcIlroy is also no stranger to sudden lapses in form and after winning his second major at the 2012 PGA Championship, toiled through a tough 2013 before roaring back with another two major wins last year.\nThomson felt the merry-go-round at the top could continue for some time and didn't feel confident that any of the pack could sustain a dynasty like 14-times major champion Woods, who spent a record 281 consecutive weeks at number one.\nHe also felt Day was at peril of a form dip after the emotion of his breakthrough win at the PGA Championship following a number of near-misses at the majors.\n\"I think there'll be a variety of (major) winners from here,\" Thomson said. \"I should think now that (Day's) won one of the majors, he might go backwards a bit for a while.\"\nThe club of youngsters at the top of the golfing world might have room for another, Thomson added.\nHe was impressed with 26-year-old Fowler's performance at the Deutsche Bank Championship.\nFowler's one-stroke win after out-duelling Swede Henrik Stenson lifted him to world number five and third on the FedExCup standings.\n\"I like his style and his attitude, I think he's very good,\" Thomson said. \"He's going to be getting his share.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-08T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:35:55.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
