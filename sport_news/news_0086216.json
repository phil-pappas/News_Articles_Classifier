(AP) — Fanendo Adi scored two second-half goals in the Portland Timbers’ 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy on Sunday. \nThe Timbers (14-11-8) scored all five goals in a 25-minute span in the second half and moved into a third-place tie with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the West. The Galaxy (14-10-9) conceded the most goals at home since Sept. 12, 2009, in a 6-3 loss to FC Dallas. \nAdi tied it at 1 in the 65th minute with a turnaround left-footed strike from the middle of the box. Three minutes later, he converted from the spot to give Portland the lead for good. \nDiego Chara netted a leaping header to make it 3-1 in the 74th minute. The Galaxy’s Robbie Keane closed the deficit in the 84th, but Darlington Nagbe answered with a breakaway goal 18 seconds after the ensuing kickoff. \nKeane gave the Galaxy the early lead in the 36th minute. The Galaxy would have clinched a berth in the conference semifinals with a win. \nMaximiliano Urruti capped the scoring in the 90th minute. It was the Timbers’ first road win against the Galaxy.
