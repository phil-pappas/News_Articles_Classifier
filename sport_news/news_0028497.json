This Saturday, City Councilor Ayanna Pressley, who championed that law, is celebrating it with a tour of Boston restaurants where diners are newly able to wash down lunch with a cold beer, or something stronger. \nBut data on neighborhood liquor licenses shows--and Pressley concedes--the law hasn't met its objectives in some of the Boston neighborhoods that need it the most. \n\"We have a pipeline issue,\" Pressley told me on Friday. \nIt's an issue that neighborhood advocates have been aware of since at least May, when the Globe reported on slow progress with the new law. Now, Pressley said they understand what's holding things up. \nA new liquor license issued under the law is tied to the neighborhood it's issued in, and costs around $3,000. On the open market, licenses start at about $250,000, terms that favor well-funded restaurateurs and established entertainment districts. Restaurant owners don't have the capital for the $3,000 fee and they aren't investing in the training, furnishings and equipment needed to start serving liquor. \nPressley said, never mind the $250,000, some restaurant owners don't have the capital for the $3,000 fee and they aren't investing in the training, furnishings and equipment needed to start serving liquor. That's especially true, Pressley said, in the neighborhoods the law was intended to serve: Dorchester, Hyde Park, Jamaica Plain, Mattapan and Roxbury. (Some Boston neighborhoods have historically had as many liquor stores as they do restaurants serving beer and wine.) \nAs a result, the law has resulted in just 20 new liquor licenses in its first year, when it could have issued as many as 25. While Dorchester is well represented, none of the restaurants are in Mattapan, just two are in Roxbury and just two are in Hyde Park. Mattapan in particular lacks any kind of restaurant where residents can have a meal and an alcoholic beverage. Townsman's dining room. \nAt least three of the restaurants that obtained liquor licenses under the new law are in neighborhoods that are hardly hurting. One is Townsman, an upscale restaurant in a new glass-and-steel luxury apartment tower on the border between Chinatown and the Financial District; another is Tres Gatos, a neighborhood tapas place on Jamaica Plain's booming Centre Street; a third is the Hilton Garden Inn at the airport. \n\"In some of those neighborhoods that were the impetus for this legislation--I'll name Roxbury and Mattapan--we have pipeline work to do there,\" Pressley said. She said she'll advocate for additional city support for small-business and restaurant owners in those neighborhoods. \"I do believe every neighborhood stands to benefit form the social and economic anchoring that restaurants provide. Every neighborhood deserves to have amenities that are walkable.\" \nPressley she said she's also pushing for permanent local control over how liquor licenses are distributed in Boston. State control over Boston liquor licenses is rooted in a 1933 law that grew out of a power struggle between Boston's growing Irish Catholic population and the more established Protestant Yankees. \"In two years we'll be back at square one,\" Pressley said. \nFor now, Pressley is celebrating the law's progress so far. On what she's calling the #Dine617 tour, she's stopping at Rincon Caribeno in Hyde Park at 11:30, Dot 2 Dot Café in Dorchester at 1, Dudley Café in Roxbury at 2:30 and Maverick Marketplace in East Boston at 4:30pm. \nHere's the full list of liquor licenses granted under the new law, so far: D/B/A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:16:15.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
