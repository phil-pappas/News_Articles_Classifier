He scored his first goal from open play since last April over the weekend as Lyon beat Reims 1-0. \nAs host, France has automatically qualified for Euro 2016 and must rely on friendly matches to get ready for the tournament. The team hosts Armenia on Thursday before a trip to Denmark three days later. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:59:29.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
