And if you go on the trips with him, you know he has a small problem with his legs, but his head is absolutely perfect,” he said.\nAndrea Cangini, the newspaper’s editor-in-chief, is sticking by his story.\n“The Vatican’s denial is expected and understandable. We have a waited a long time before publishing the news as we wanted to check it out. We have not the slightest doubt about its veracity,” Cangini said.\nHe added the news was published because the right to privacy is less important than the right of public opinion to be informed.\n“We decided that that which applies to a Head of State or Government also applies to the Pope,” Cangini said.\nPope Francis Accepts Atheists: Not the First\nConcerns for Francis’s health resurfaced in May during his visit to parishioners of the seaside town of Ostia.\n“I ask you to pray for me. I am a bit old and a bit sick,” he said.\nLast year, returning from his South Korean trip, Francis told journalists on the papal plane that he doesn’t expects to live long.\n“Two or three years and then I’ll be off to the Father’s house,” he said.\nThe rumors about his health come in the final and delicate days of the Synod of Bishops on the family, which met disagreement among conservative and liberal bishops over issues such as Communion for divorced and remarried Catholics, sex, and homosexuality.\nImage: Pope Francis.
