But from a lot of comments I see from readers after the first two preseason games, you'd think the season has started and there is no hope. It's kind of what preseason is all about, to attempt to fix the issues before the regular season starts. I hate using the word \"patience,\" but I think we need it, at least during the preseason. -- Doug, Oakland, Calif.\nA: And that is why your question moved to the top of today's list. It's almost as if the Heat's 0-2 in the preseason is somehow equivalent to the Dolphins' 1-3 that got Joe Philbin fired. The results of preseason games are meaningless. In any sport. What transpires during those games is not. So, yes, there were times on Twitter or in my blog that I have been critical. I'm still concerned about the lack of 3-point shooting, about whether Goran Dragic is going to be maximized. But I also know that until Hassan Whiteside returns, the Heat's opening lineup only can offer a four-fifths solution. Beyond that, it's probably best that some of these issues are arising, so Erik Spoelstra at least can get a read on what doesn't work. If Spoelstra really wanted to win these first two exhibitions, he had the means to make it happen. What he is looking for is about far more than the moment. Far more.\nSubmit your question!

Fill out my online form. Read the story Q: Do you think Hassan Whitesides health will be an issue this year? And what are you hearing about his attitude on and off the court this past offseason? -- Brent, Los Angeles.\nA: Yes, I do think Hassan's health will be an issue. No, not this current strained calf. Unless the Heat have been sandbagging, this is not believed to be significant. The concern is having him on the court. A lot. The lesson last from season, all around the league, is that you cannot lose one of your top three players. Hassan is one of the Heat's top three players. As for his attitude, the fact that he traveled with the Heat to Louisville shows that the team is going to keep him engaged and working.\nQ: Shabazz Napier left the Heat and all of a sudden he became Magic Johnson? What gives? What went wrong when he was with the Heat? -- Masoud, Tucson, Ariz.\nA: I'm glad he had his moment Wednesday in Louisville. He works hard. But the reality is he is undersized and always will be fighting an uphill battle. It came down to the Heat seeing other roster candidates ahead of him, including Josh Richardson and Tyler Johnson in the backcourt. Now, if those two don't pan out, we can revisit Shabazz. But, for now, you move on, rather than bemoaning a possible 12th man getting away.\nOctober 7, 2015\nQ: Ira, I'm glad the season is almost here. I watched the games last year when Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic played together. I also watched them play together a couple nights ago. From my perspective it seems Goran will be wasted. Wade, like last year, refuses to give up control of the ball. His pounding of the ball is boring and won't get many wins. The only way this team is as successful as it can be is for all the parts to be used. It could be a beautiful thing. -- Juan.\nA: And it still can be. And it's up to Erik Spoelstra, as much as anyone, to make it just that. This team has to get back to a selfless approach. The problem is that you still have so many players in contract years, such as Wade, Hassan Whiteside, Luol Deng, Amar'e Stoudemire and Gerald Green, and not enough salary-cap cash in the 2016 offseason to take care of many of them, let alone all of them. This team will be at its best if arguably everyone's stats are down. That will mean it is playing more as a team. But it's one thing for players to talk about buying in; it's another to get them to do it. That's where Spoelstra and Pat Riley enter the equation with their influence.\nQ: Dragic looks lost out there because he can't make plays on the fly, everything is set play after set play. The offense only had flow in the preseason opener when the ball was being pushed, or somebody was making a play. Set play after set play and we could only score 77 points, the same set plays LeBron James would bypass and draw up something else when he was here. The offense doesn't need work, it just needs its leash taken off. Let the guys do what they do best. -- Ben.\nA: Except what Hassan Whiteside, Chris Bosh, Luol Deng, Josh McRoberts, Amar'e Stoudemire, Justise Winslow and Dwyane Wade, at this stage of his career, do best is play halfcourt offense. Playing at speed, when it comes to the rotation players, basically is the preferred mode for only Goran Dragic and Gerald Green. Clearly a compromise has to be reached. But it will come down to how many of the mainstays are willing to run, more than Spoelstra's play calls. The Heat's halfcourt sets are fine; there just might not be enough shooting to finish them off. But there are far more pick-and-roll options than when LeBron was with the team.\nQ: Ira, the Heat continued a trend of being dreadfully slow defensively in rotating to the open long-distance shooter against the Hornets. Yes, this was only an exhibition, and the first one, at that, but I doubt the slow rotation defensively on the wing is going to change. -- Matt.\nA: What could help is having Whiteside back in the lineup. That could keep defenders at home more often, knowing there would be a second-line of defense in case of a blow-by. But let's be realistic, how many quality perimeter defenders do the Heat have beyond Deng (unless Winslow can grow into one real fast)?\nOctober 6, 2015\nQ: Ira, I have to be honest, when it came to Mario Chalmers I thought his time in a Heat uniform would be coming to an end. But I'm starting to move away from that because of Josh McRoberts and Justise Winslow. One thing I noticed is Chalmers is at his best when he can be a spot-up jump shooter. With these two around, Chalmers is able to be just that because of the ability of McRoberts and Winslow to draw attention and find guys open for the three. Should Miami utilize Chalmers as a 3-point artist moving forward? -- Darryl, Fitzgerald, Ga.\nA: You raise a really good point. With a second unit that features McRoberts and Winslow, Chalmers doesn't necessarily need to be a facilitator in the halfcourt. Of course, that also could then become a prime spot for a spot-up 3-point specialist, something the Heat lack. I'm just not sure Mario is that player. But that is the type of role he played when playing alongside Dwyane Wade and LeBron James. What the Heat will have to decide by the end of the preseason is whether someone else might be able to handle such a shooting role if a trade offer becomes available to alleviate Chalmers' tax hit.\nQ: Only 77 points in the first game and the Heat offense looks just dreadful. Other teams at same phase of the preseason score in the 90s or 100s, as any NBA team should be able to do. Plain and simple, the Heat offense under Erik Spoelstra looks as if it will never reach its full potential. -- Javier, Doral.\nA: First, never, ever, ever make judgments based on preseason games (or summer-league games, or scrimmages). The goal Sunday was not to maximize the scoring total; it was to utilize players for precise minute totals. This team has plenty of scoring. Although I am concerned that without the bonus of 3-pointers, sustaining triple-digit totals on a regular basis becomes increasingly more difficult.\nQ: I agree that Dwyane Wade needs to play off the ball, like he did with LeBron James. -- Kevin.\nA: It's one thing to convince a player to forgo touches for LeBron James. It's another to get him to do it for Goran Dragic. But you are correct. That is precisely what has to happen. And by doing that, it also could keep Wade fresher and perhaps even extend his career. But Dwyane still appears to relish advancing the ball. It is something that Spoelstra will have to get his guards to work through.\nOctober 5, 2015\nQ: Ira, I like your optimism and yes there are many promising things about the Miami Heat after their preseason opener against Charlotte. But as Doc Rivers says, the NBA is a make-or-miss league. You must hit shots to win in the NBA. That is reality. The Heat need a shooter or two with ice in their veins. They need a player who can knock down five in a row from long range. That type of shooting does two things: 1) stops the other team's momentum when needed. and 2) can blow a game open and make it an easy on many long nights in the NBA. You need both in the NBA. Without that, the Heat will never get the chance to exploit the possibilities. You will be writing many articles all season of possibilities never exploited. -- Stuart.\nA: And so when I got home from Sunday's game, the first thing my wife asked (and, yes, I married a woman who watches preseason basketball) is when the Heat are going to trade for a shooter. While the spacing obviously would have been different with Hassan Whiteside available, I'm not sure if the box score didn't paint an accurate picture with the Heat's 3-of-16 shooting on 3-pointers. The clunk-fest was not necessarily out of character of many of those who took those threes. I know Erik Spoelstra has spoken of alternate ways of creating spacing, and I highly doubt this team will take a large volume of threes, but this is a roster that could use a 3-point infusion. And there still is time to get something done in that regard. The hope is I don't spend the whole season with the wife asking me to take out the garbage and then go find a 3-point shooter.\nQ: I just don't see how an offense where Goran Dragic spends majority of the time in the corner not handling the ball helps anyone. Especially if the ball is just going to stick and not even be kicked out to him, our best ballhandler and 3-point shooter. Dragic continues to look like a shell of himself under Spo and the Miami Heat. It's just preseason but an offense where the ball sticks in one guy's hand in halfcourt situations most likely won't prosper. -- Ben.\nA: I have to admit that I was thinking the same thing while watching Sunday's game, that the Heat have yet to find a way to maximize Goran as a featured point guard. It's almost as if he's their \"transition\" point guard, but not necessarily the featured distributor in the halfcourt. The Dragic situation very much appears to remain a work in progress.\nQ: Hi, Ira. At first glance, it's easy to see why Justise Winslow dropped in the draft, and why Stan Van Gundy not only snatched up Stanley Johnson over Winslow, but said that he wasn't even on his radar at small forward or shooting guard. After watching Winslow through summer league, training camp, and now the Heat's first exhibition, the conclusion has to be that he has one of the most heavy-handed jump shots of any heralded wing player to come out in recent memory. I mean, the ball just clangs off the hoop. There's no touch whatsoever. That said, he has a very strong, thick, body, a good handle, can run the floor, and get in your face on defense. With these qualities, and what appears like a solid basketball IQ for a 19-year-old, I think that if he makes shooting a major priority, he will probably become a very solid mid-range shooter as his career moves along. Dwyane Wade didn't have much of a shot coming out (though Winslow is not nearly the athlete that Dwyane was). -- Matt\nA: While Justise is more about the future than necessarily the present, in order for him to be cast in the role he is being set up for, he has to make shots. The shots will be there for him to take. And the opposition will encourage him to shoot. He well could find himself as the Henry Walker of this season's roster, with opponents encouraging him to shoot. For the short term, it could come down to convert or sit, at least until the shot comes around.\nOctober 4, 2015\nQ: Isn't this version of Miami Heat built to take multiple injuries and still make the playoffs? Would you agree one of their strengths this year is their impressive depth? -- John, Manila.\nA: Yes. Last season when Dwyane Wade missed a quarter of the schedule, the options were limited. This season,. Gerald Green can step in. Last season, without Chris Bosh and Josh McRoberts, you were looking at Henry Walker and Michael Beasley. But let's also not overstate depth. This still comes down to the contributions of veterans such as Wade and Bosh. The problem last season was too often having second-team players forced into leading roles, and having third-string players forced to play as rotation players. Now there is a proven veteran backup at just about every position, plus the youthful promise of Justise Winslow and Josh Richardson. If there is a concern, it is that some of the veteran reserves, such as Chris Andersen and Amar'e Stoudemire, are a bit older, which could make them injury concerns, as well. But this is closer to what the Heat had a few years back, with Rashard Lewis, Ray Allen and Shane Battier.\nQ: Hey Ira, what are the odds of Hassan Whiteside playing in the preseason? -- Charlie.\nA: There has been no indication from the Heat that Hassan's calf injury is anything more than an inconvenience. He still has been doing light shooting and spent the camp sessions in practice gear. I would expect him to be back early in this eight-game preseason run (and wouldn't necessarily expect every Heat player to appear in all eight). What is lost, however, is the continuity needed, especially when his shot-blocking allows the Heat to play with a different defensive approach. It will be interesting to see how hard the Heat push for a return, and how hard Hassan pushes himself.\nQ: You've said that any team with LeBron James looks best to win the East. But if that was the case, why hasn't he been to the Finals 12 times? -- Zach.\nA: Because favorites don't always finish first. What I said was that with LeBron, the Cavaliers enter the preseason as the clear favorites to win the Eastern Conference. But LeBron's teams don't always push for the top seed in the playoffs. Still, the way the East sets up this season, with the Hawks losing DeMarre Carroll and the Bulls working under a first-year coach, there is Cleveland and then everybody else when it comes to contenders. So that again makes LeBron and the Cavaliers the clear target.\nOctober 3, 2015\nQ: I think that James Ennis should be guaranteed the Heat's 15th roster spot. His athleticism is great and he can be a good third-string small forward. I don't see anyone on the Heat's training-camp roster with more upside than him. He also defended LeBron James well during the last meeting between the Cavaliers and Heat. Who do you think deserves the last spot on this roster? -- Michael, New York.\nA: As I've written before, I'm still not sold on James as the right fit for this roster at this time. If the Heat decided to undergo a complete rebuild in the wake of LeBron James' departure, then James would fit the type of mold sought. But this is a team looking to win at a high level, as opposed to all-out development mode. First, unless James modifies his full guarantee for opening night, I think is chances would be significantly reduced. Beyond that, because of the Heat's position against the tax, I'm not sure they even will keep a 15th player. What I would do is keep that spot open, see who is cut from other teams, and then try to add a three-and-D veteran should one shake free, If you're asking about the odds of James making the final cut under the current terms of his contract, I'd put it at less than 50-50, as much because of the finances as his ability. It's a cold reality of the Heat's current state.\nQ: On paper, the Heat look as if they could possibly win the East, with all these injury woes from other teams. If we can stay healthy, that might be the difference in taking the conference. What do you think? -- Toby, Cooper City.\nA: On paper, any team with LeBron James looks best to win the East. So that's still the Cavaliers. And while several teams in the mix in the East are dealing with early injuries, such as the Bulls with Mike Dunleavy and Derrick Rose, the Heat, because of the age of their roster, run that risk, as well. Health can't be forecast. Injuries just happen. Depth, however, can mitigate the impact of injuries. The concern with the Heat is that much of the depth is older, as well, with plenty of NBA mileage.\nQ: From the reports, Hassan Whiteside's calf injury isn't that serious. But I'm wondering, could Hassan's calf injury be due to the Heat having him work on his game all summer long? I don't think he had that much time to wind down a lot.\nA: One of the best parts of the offseason was Hassan being a self-starter in the gym. No one pushed Hassan more than Hassan. But part of such efforts has to be prudence, perhaps not pushing as hard on the eve of camp. For a player who will eventually command huge money for extended years, the next step for Hassan is to show he can manage injuries, minimize their impact, and, even more importantly, avoid them whenever possible.\nOctober 2, 2015\nQ: If the Heat go with 14 players, it's to keep a spot open for Michael Beasley when he returns as China MVP, right? -- Eddie.\nQ: It's always nice to have Beasley as an \"in case of emergency break glass\" option. Although this season, we hope not to have to use it. -- Dave.\nQ: So knowing what we know now, would you prefer Derrick Rose or Michael Beasley? High expectations with low results. -- Daniel.\nA: I group these together figuring with Michael signing to play in China that we won't have to address the subject again. I highly, highly doubt, with the Heat's current position against the luxury tax, that Michael will be hearing from the Heat this season. And I'm still not sure that the Heat won't consider going with 14 players as a means of reducing or help eliminating the luxury tax. I do agree that I'm somewhat surprised that there isn't a place for Michael in the league with his scoring abilities. But it's the classic case of weighing the baggage. But the Rose comparisons are ludicrous. Derrick Rose, when healthy, is a very, very good, star-ability player. And there is no reason not to assume a degree of health going forward. And it wasn't just Rose in that 2008 draft that Beasley is weighed against.\nQ: If Hassan Whiteside takes the Early Bird contract, how soon after that could the Heat extend him? Could there be a hush-hush deal already worked out? -- Tim.\nA: First a clarification from yesterday's post: The Heat did not have the means to sign Whiteside to a three-year deal last season to automatically get him directly to Bird Rights free agency; they lacked the exception or cap space needed for anything beyond a two-year deal when he was added. If Whiteside took an Early Bird deal this coming offseason (which he won't, with that 2016-17 salary number likely to come in under $8 million), he would be positioned a year later for a major deal. I do think there will be a request to at least have him consider waiting one more year to cash out, but I doubt any player would risk leaving so much additional money on the table.\nQ: No news on James Ennis? -- Timmy.\nA: Well, he is in camp, but I believe it is unlikely he will make the opening-night roster unless he agrees to yet again modify his contract, this time to remove the opening-night guarantee date for his full 2015-16 salary. Based on the composition of the current roster, even if he makes the regular-season roster, he likely would be a player likely to be inactive on many game nights.\nOctober 1, 2015\nQ: Won't the Heat try to lock up Hassan Whiteside at some point this season? Or will cap trigonometry prevent that? -- Avery.\nA: I guess we've drifted away from this prickly topic for a while, so it's probably worth addressing again as we head into the season. Under NBA rules, the Heat have no ability to lock up Whiteside before the start of free agency. And even then, they lack the type of incumbent-team advantage that is typical in free agency because Whiteside will not have completed the required three seasons with the same team. The only ways the Heat can re-sign Whiteside without regard to the 2015-16 salary cap is if he again accepts the minimum salary (not happening) or the Early Bird average salary, which could fall at about the $8 million range (also likely far below his expected market value). Instead, the Heat will have to hold aside sufficient cap space to re-sign Hassan, just as any outside team would. Had the Heat signed Whiteside to a three-year deal instead of a two-year deal, they would not have had this issue (three seasons are required for full Bird Rights, which allows you to exceed the cap up to the maximum salary). Then again, there wasn't an NBA team that saw Whiteside as a three-year player when he was added by the Heat last season. About the only way Whiteside could be locked up before free agency would be if the Heat were to trade him to a team that has ample salary-cap space. Bottom line: Whiteside will enter 2016 free agency as a player up for grabs to any team with the requisite salary-cap space.\nQ: You keep mentioning Udonis Haslem as part of the power rotation. He is a power player, but not a rotation player. He's a non-contributor. -- Jose.\nA: I have listed him among the big men to show how the Heat are loaded in the power rotation. I use the term \"rotation\" to include all at the position. But when listing roles, it is difficult to envision one for Udonis. Actually, it's difficult to delineate one for Chris Andersen, when counting Hassan Whiteside and Amar'e Stoudemire at center, then Chris Bosh and Josh McRoberts at power forward. I figure Birdman will be a break-open-in-case-of-emergency center for the games that Whiteside or Stoudemire miss. As for Haslem, \"mentor\" again appears his most likely roster role.\nQ: Hi, Ira. I would be interested to know if Greg Whittington may have the skill set necessary to secure the 15th roster spot. It is my understanding he played well in the summer league, yes, I know, summer league, he is a decent perimeter defender, he's 22 years old, therefore developable, still. At 6-8 he can play at least two positions. Finally, as the fifteenth roster player it is not like playing time will be of significant concern to him or the team, but it would not be bad idea for the Heat to look down the road a piece rather than adding yet another pair of 30-plus of legs. -- Joaquin.\nA: The problem is they are so loaded in the power rotation that instead of a swing forward, what they need is a true wing defender, someone in the Gerald Wallace mold, if not Wallace himself. That said, amid all the luxury-tax concern, I'm not sold that the Heat even will keep 15. It is quite possible they open the regular season with 14.\nSeptember 30, 2015\nQ: Ira, could we be seeing the Heat holding out Hassan Whiteside so other teams begin to have doubts and he doesn't get a contract that could be too rich for the Heat? Wouldn't the Heat want to keep his minutes (and stats) down until they can get him back under contract? -- Ted.\nA: First, I am sure his calf issue has nothing to do with such nefarious possibilities. But it is a shame that on the showcase day of training camp that he couldn't get himself on the court. On the other hand, if he was injured because he wanted to get into the best possible shape, then such are the inherent risks of pre-camp workouts. If Hassan's minutes are down this season, the only way it would be by design is if it is a case of Erik Spoelstra opening minutes in a deep power rotation that also includes Chris Bosh, Josh McRoberts, Amar'e Stoudemire, Chris Andersen and Udonis Haslem. But I don't think there is any chance, in any scenario, that the Heat purposely attempt to manipulate his statistics. First, opposing teams clearly would be able to see through such chicanery, and even if Hassan's numbers do dip, there probably still are teams (and it only takes one) that would go ahead and pay him off last season's productivity. Hassan has already shown his possibilities. Those are possibilities that can't suddenly be masked. No, the Heat will have to have cash in reserve for Hassan, no matter how much he does or doesn't play, no matter how massive or mundane his statistics are this season.\nQ: Could you see a Mario Chalmers trade if any of the guards in training camp (Tyler Johnson, Josh Richardson, etc.) win the backup point guard by the end of training camp? -- Ben.\nA: I'm not sure anyone beyond Mario is in position to \"win\" the backup spot at point guard behind Goran Dragic. But I'm not sure that is essential, either. As long as there is someone who even inspires confidence, it would make it easier to move Mario. But if, as I still believe is the case, the Heat are continuing to look to eliminate their luxury tax, it still would take an outside suitor willing to take on Chalmers' contract. I think the chances of Mario being moved could be as much a factor of another team developing a need for his services as the Heat pushing for tax savings.\nQ: Expiring contacts are great trade chips to a team who wants cap relief at season's end. And such team would be willing to trade back talented players whose contracts extend past this season. True? -- Martin.\nA: Yes. But the Heat, at least if reports of a Kevin Durant pursuit are to be believed, are more likely to be among teams looking to shed future salary (Josh McRoberts?) than take on additional money for coming seasons. The reason the Heat have so many expiring contracts is because of the flexibility it provides the 2016 offseason, and not because of the possibility of dealing for other teams' extended money.\nSeptember 29, 2015\nQ: I've always thought of the possibility of adding Gerald Wallace to the Heat. Knowing how we like to take on reclamation projects, he seems like the perfect candidate to potentially be able to give us quality minutes the way we expect Amar'e to this year, in order to maintain health and consistency. What are the odds Pat Riley can get him down here at a minimum? -- Chris, Miami.\nA: I, too, would be in favor of making a move for Wallace, if he would be amenable to the minimum salary -- and accept a potentially limited role. But while I think it would be better use of James Ennis' roster spot for a team in win-now mode, I also could appreciate how such a move might not sit well with Gerald Green, who took a significant pay cut to the minimum to play as a reserve wing with the Heat, with the emphasis on \"play.\" But if Wallace would sign as a mentor and break-in-case-of-emergency wing defender and spot scorer, I think it would be a minimal risk. But remember, much of such an equation would be more up to Wallace than the Heat.\nQ: Ira, could Mike Miller be the perfect fit for the final spot on our roster? He'd help address our 3-point shooting/spacing problems, he'd bolster our depth on the wing, and he's a great locker-room presence. Plus, it just might help take some of the heat off of ownership for their last round of tax-saving moves that sent Mr. \"Let it Fly\" away in the first place. -- Cristiano, Bethlehem, Pa.\nA: See, I think it would be the exact opposite, that it would rekindle memories of how the Heat waived Miller at a time when he still could contribute for a Heat team that still needed his contribution. What Mike's spot minutes in the playoffs with the Cavaliers showed was that even with his 3-point shooting, he remains a defensive negative when on the court. Not only do I think the Heat should move on, but it appears Miller will move on to sign a deal with the Nuggets, who covet his veteran mentorship.\nQ: With another miserable start to the season for the Dolphins and another disappointing Miami Marlins season, the NBA season can't start soon enough. Bring on the band. Here come the Miami Heat! -- Stuart.\nA: So not only do they have to return to the playoffs, but they have to save South Florida sports?\nSeptember 28, 2015\nQ: Every team has holes and according to the experts it's 3-point shooting and wing defense for the Heat. I believe it's neither of those. I feel all eyes are on Erik Spoelstra. Can he get his team to play together? -- Edgar, Miami.\nA: I wrote about that in my Sunday column, because I'm not sure he has pieces that perfectly mesh. He can't make 3-pointers and he can't play as a defensive stopper (well, unguarded, he probably could drain a few threes, and he does step in during defensive drills but I digress). Players still have to step up in those roles. What he can do is put his players in the best position to succeed. Now, whether the Heat can succeed without 3-point efficiency and defensive deterrence on the wing is another story. While there certainly is some youth on this roster, with Hassan Whiteside and Justise Winslow capable of contributing, this largely is a roster of veterans who are what they are. It's not as if the Heat coaching staff is going to develop a 3-point stroke from a player who isn't a 3-point shooter, or make a player a defensive stopper who isn't a defensive stopper. But there also are plenty of options on the roster who thrive in other facets. The challenge for Spoelstra is maximizing the positives to the degree they can offset the shortcomings. At this point, there appear to be more answers than questions, which is good place to start.\nQ: A report came out saying if Kevin Durant leaves Oklahoma City that Washington and Miami are on top of his list. Any truth to this? Thanks. -- Chris, Miami,\nA: Well, if a \"report came out,\" then there must be something to it. (The Internets: All truth, all the time.) Look, there simply are too many variables at play, including how Durant overcomes his foot issues this season and how the Thunder fare under Billy Donovan. What I can tell you is that I have heard from a confidant of Durant who lives in South Florida that a homecoming to Washington is tempting to Durant. As for the Heat possibilities, I guess that comes down to one's belief in the Cult of Riley. Some players drink the Pat-Aid, some don't.\nQ: There's always a question mark at backup point guard with a reliable 3-point shot. Why not trade for a young prospect? -- Preyesh, New Jersey.\nA: I don't think there's that much of a question mark at the moment. Mario Chalmers is a backup point guard who can make 3-pointers and has the advantage of knowing this team, these teammates and this system. I don't think backup point guard becomes as issue as long as Goran Dragic remains available as the starter and Mario Chalmers remains available as his backup. I would rate the need for another 3-pointer shooter and a wing defender as greater concerns at the moment. And keep an eye on 3-point-shooting Corey Hawkins during training camp. He could wind up as the type of young point presence you are talking about.\nSeptember 27, 2015\nQ: The Heat's offense should go through Chris Bosh, not Hassan Whiteside. Bosh is a much better offensive player. -- Kevin.\nA: It's been interesting this past week, the reader-fueled debates about how certain dynamics should play out this season, be it the ball in the hands of Dwyane Wade or Goran Dragic, or whether Bosh or Whiteside should be the primary post option. But, as Erik Spoelstra would/will say (I think), this is not a conventional roster, so I'm not sure any type of conventional, majority-of-the-time thinking fits. In order to spread the wealth and keep everyone happy, I'm not sure there should be a set approach from game to game. If Whiteside has an advantage against a small-ball team, then go in that direction. If Bosh can draw a big man out of the post and drive past him, then utilize that advantage. Same with Wade and Dragic. This will be one of Spoelstra's greatest challenges, but the reality is that lower individual statistics across the board could be an indication of the Heat becoming a better team. There is plenty of talent that can be utilized. But the only way the majority of it is tapped is if there is a collective appreciation that less could be more from an individual standpoint.\nQ: In iso situations late in games, I still think you have to go with Dwyane Wade. -- Leif.\nA: And I have no issue with that. With the game close and the clock winding down, there are few better options in the NBA, let alone on this roster. But what the Heat simply cannot have is Wade pounding seconds away on the dribble when there are so many other scoring options on the floor. At ends of games, this is a roster capable of putting five scorers on the floor. If time allows, all of those options have to be considered, even if it almost always starts and runs through Wade.\nQ: What is your expert opinion about the Heat this season? Are you waiting to see them on the court first before making predictions? I'm not sold on them yet. I still feel they are a fourth seed, trailing the Cavs, Bucks, and Pistons or Wizards. -- Bryan, Davie.\nA: I still don't know what the collective result will be because there still are concerns about the 3-poont shooting and individual defense. Getting past injuries, which you never can truly forecast, I'd say the ceiling would be No. 2 in the East, but that if some of the concerns manifest themselves, then beyond the Cavaliers, there has to be respect for the Bucks, Bulls, Wizards and still the Hawks, let alone what Toronto has done in reconfiguring its roster. Other than the 76ers, I think the balance of the East could remain in the playoff mix, with the Magic and perhaps even Knicks stronger this season.\nSeptember 26, 2015\nQ: Hey Ira, Erik Spoelstra just mentioned that he doesn't plan on using restrictions on Dwyane Wade and that he knows he has to be the leader of team. Is D-Wade going to be the focal point of the offense or will Spoelstra allow the offense run through Goran Dragic. He (Goran Dragic) is a pure point guard after all -- Trevor.\nA: It will be unique to actually see a point guard advancing the ball, since until the arrival of Dragic, it mostly had been Dwyane Wade or LeBron James handling that assignment. If the Heat do, indeed, run, then Dragic has to be the engine of that offense. But if there is more of a halfcourt approach, then Wade could again advance the ball, before setting up Dragic and Chris Bosh to run their pick-and-roll game. In a perfect world, there would be no singular focus, so the Heat can maximize the possibilities of this roster. But this is the NBA, where a go-to player almost always emerges.\nQ: The way I see it, as it stands right now, if Pat Riley and the front office truly believe this is a contender, they'd keep Mario Chalmers because he is the best backcourt option behind Goran Dragic and Dwyane Wade on this roster. If they're not sold on this roster and th­inking maybe a signing this summer will solidify contention, then and only then, do they move him. Do you think it's that simple? -- Ciara. Miami.\nA: I don't think anything is simple when it comes to the luxury tax. First, the tax is not just a one-year concern. Once you enter the \"repeater\" tax, the cycle could keep you in it for years, and limit your other potential moves. Beyond that, the tax solely is about money, so it comes down to whether you want to compromise your current roster and your immediate chances at victory. I agree that, at the moment, Mario Chalmers is the third-best guard on the roster (especially if you consider Justise Winslow and Gerald Green to primarily be small forwards). But I also believe this roster is quite fluid. If either Josh Richardson or Tyler Johnson, or both, prove they are up to immediate minutes, it could change the equation with Chalmers. The fast-tracking of Winslow could impact that situation, as well, since it could allow Dwyane Wade to shift to point guard when Goran Dragic goes out. At the moment, I'm not sure the Heat can afford to be without Chalmers. But it's also not yet even October. So there is plenty of time for Spoelstra to consider all of his options.\nQ: This time last year we were talking about how Chris Bosh needs to step up and be the leader of this team especially with that big contract. What do we expect now? Should we have the same expectations? Or just be happy whatever he gives us because he went through a traumatic experience last season? -- Conrad, West Palm Beach.\nA: Based on everything Chris said at his Thursday news conference, there should be no reason not to expect him to return to his former self. If that's the case, he has to be good, very good, because of the investment the Heat made in the wake of LeBron James' departure. The Heat has set him up with the perfect pick-and-roll point guard in Goran Dragic. In many ways, he has never been better positioned for offensive success during his Heat tenure. The untold story is how much the Heat will continue to need Bosh for his defensive contributions. Even with Hassan Whiteside's emergence, Chris has to quarterback the back line of the defense.\nSeptember 25, 2015\nQ: Ira, I watched the Chris Bosh press conference on Sun Sports. I loved his passion and am rooting for him more than ever. Do you think Dwyane Wade brings the same passion? -- Neal.\nA: I'm not sure anyone can bring the range of emotions as a player who first was told his life was in danger and then was told there was a possibility he might never again be able to play a game he loves. Based on what Chris said Thursday, I'd almost want to make him a team captain this coming season, considering the passion he expressed for the game and for wining. Udonis Haslem, one of the current co-captains, certainly has carried that passion through his career. But Dwyane, the team's other co-captain, has been the one after the tough losses who has downplayed some of the significance of the night-in, night-out scheduling. In fact, there have been times when Chris has been decidedly emotional after losses while Dwyane has been stoic. They are friends but also decidedly different personalities. I would hope that anyone who went through the decline the Heat endured last season would appreciate the value of every game this season. Chris spoke Thursday of such resolve. It will be interesting to see how it manifests itself across the roster, especially those returning from last season.\nQ: Is \"Lob City East\" back for the Heat? -- Will.\nA: With Hassan Whiteside in place, I would assume such an approach would be mandatory. Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic certainly are capable of getting him the ball. But I don't know if you can be \"Lob City East\" with just one dunker in the starting lineup (Whiteside) and one in the bench (Gerald Green) rotation. It could come down to how much spring in the step remains for Chris Bosh and Chris Andersen. Or if Tyler Johnson cracks the rotation. If Birdman and Johnson takes flight, then the rims could be rattling.\nQ: I understand the Miami Heat still have been saving the 15th roster spot. Is it possible they may be waiting on the decision of Ray Allen to decide if he wants to continue to play basketball? If so, do you see Miami trying to obtain him since they are lacking so bad in 3-point shooting? -- Earl, Jersey City.\nA: My thought is the longer a player is away from the game, the less likely he is to return. Then again, with the Warriors reportedly reaching out to Ben Gordon, there clearly is a league-wide desire to explore all 3-point options. But Ray has been mum to this point.\nSeptember 24, 2015\nQ: Can Erik Spoelstra stand up to his older players and tell them that the plan is for Hassan Whiteside to rebound the ball, Goran Dragic to push the ball, and for everyone else to run? -- Robert.\nA: First, I'm not sure I've known many coaches who don't go into camp preaching playing at pace. Spoelstra said as much to us on Wednesday. And you're right, it often is the half-court and older players who balk at the prospect. But Spoelstra also still needs time to learn this roster, these players, which even he acknowledged. And it could wind up as having a running lineup and a halfcourt lineup. For example, while Gerald Green is best at pace, Amar'e Stoudemire is not. What matters most is finding a system that best utilizes all the assets of this roster. And, to be honest, it sure looks like a roster with Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Josh McRoberts Amar'e Stoudemire and the post-up game of Hassan Whiteside might be better suited to work out of halfcourt sets. It will be interesting to see how Spoelstra tries to tie those assets into Goran Dragic's game.\nQ: How can we think the Heat will be much improved this year? Erik Spoelstra is still coach, and we have the same core with the same health issues. -- Marc.\nA: While I agree that assumptions cannot be made about Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and Josh McRoberts returning to the level they were before last season's injuries or illness, we also can't assume that they won't. In each of those cases, there have been nothing but positive signs, be it Bosh's steady progress, Wade's commitment to conditioning and McRoberts' recovery. So just with those three factors, the Heat would be in a better position than last season. As for Spoelstra, this is the first training camp he will have Hassan Whiteside and Goran Dragic, and the first offseason he had to plan for the season-long presence of both. While some question Spoelstra's game management, his offseason planning is often when he is at his best. Put it this way, here's the counter-argument: What reason is there to believe the Heat won't be better? In other words, in what, if any aspect, have they gotten worse? The offseason losses are Michael Beasley, Henry Walker, Zoran Dragic and Shabazz Napier. The offseason additions are Amar'e Stoudemire, Gerald Green, Justise Winslow and Josh Richardson. By any measurement or metric, how is that not an upgrade? If the Heat are healthy, then, yes, I would agree that it would be fair to turn deeper inspection to the coaching staff. For now, the arrow certainly appears to be pointing up after a how-low-can-you-go season.\nQ: Ira, this guy LeBron James left the Heat in such a manner that made Pat Riley, the organization, the team, the players, the community and the fans so dumbfounded, and now they are buddy-buddies? What is going on? This is the same man who cost the Heat several draft picks, but left with a devilish smile and then nothing else. How could these guys hang out with this . . .? -- Matt, Tucson.\nA: So tell us how you really feel. Look, this is a different time and era, which is why even Pat Riley has gotten away from his opponents-as-only-enemies mantra. Today's players compete and then fraternize. You deal with it and you move on. If Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh can accept LeBron leaving them after four consecutive trips to the NBA Finals, then who are we to question that relationship? Their perspective is that he also helped them reap the rewards of four consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals.\nSeptember 23, 2015\nQ: Dwyane Wade is going to have a comeback season this year if Miami can keep his minutes down, with their depth they have now. -- Johnny.\nA: The thing is, Dwyane doesn't need to have a \"comeback\" season. He had a very good season last season -- when he played. What matters is his availability. The Heat are a better team when Dwyane is in the starting lineup. And when he is in the starting lineup, it allows that depth to play as depth, instead of having to overachieve. There is plenty to be said about now having Gerald Green and Justise Winslow in reserve. But that's where they belong -- Green because of his ability to inject vitality into the mix, Winslow because his learning curve would be eased by going against reserves. What matters most is Dwyane allowing the Heat to maximize their depth by allowing the rotation to become just that, a set rotation. When Dwyane starts missing games, a lot of games, that's when it all goes off the rails, when lineup roulette, and, therefore, rotation roulette ensues. Stability for the Heat starts with Wade. And he very much is still being paid superstar starter's money. The best days for the Heat are the ones when the ball goes up and Wade is on the court. There haven't been enough of those the past two seasons.\nQ: Everyone talks about the 2016 free agent \"bonanza,\" but I don't see it. Yes, there is lots of salary cap space to lure big-name stars but most of the real ones are locked up by multi-year contracts. With the exceptions of Kevin Durant and Al Horford, the rest are aging or injury prone or role players who are not worth big contracts. Wouldn't it be better to pay the starters and young players we have who prove themselves this season? Continuity has been the key for the Spurs and is greatly underrated in the overall rush to hijack players on your way to a championship. -- Jack, Fort Myers.\nA: Yes, in a perfect world Dwyane Wade and Hassan Whiteside play so well that the bulk of the Heat's free-agent money goes to them. If those two force Pat Riley into a corner, then it just might become a very comfortable corner for him. And, as this offseason showed, there always will be players who want to share in such forecast success, with the Heat landing Gerald Green and Amar'e Stoudemire for pennies on the dollar. Durant will loom just as any star heading into free agency will loom. But this Heat roster has the opportunity to make a case for being good enough. And so we begin.\nQ: Is it fair to say that LeBron James is using his Heat connections to recruit Hassan Whiteside? -- Happy.\nA: It's actually interesting regarding that supposed sphere of influence, considering Mike Miller was dealt by the Cavaliers this offseason with no interference from LeBron and that Norris Cole never made it to Cleveland despite having the same agent as LeBron. For that matter, the Tristan Thompson situation never became a LeBron ultimatum, either. It could be that LeBron merely was nostalgic for the good times when he hung out with his former Heat teammates (and Hassan) this past weekend. Consider it more of a reunion than a poaching mission.\nSeptember 22, 2015\nQ: Ira, I think I know the Heat lineup at times this coming season: four guards and Hassan Whiteside. Otherwise, why signing so many guards? Did someone say the next season is going to be extra, extra small ball? -- Matt, Tucson, Ariza.\nA: I mentioned the Heat's camp roster featuring 10 guards only to emphasize the surprise of adding smallish guards John Lucas III and Tre Kelley as the final two players on the 20-player camp roster. Then again, with only a maximum of 15 players making the regular-season roster, it's not as if there isn't room for excess. But considering Gerald Green, Justise Winslow and Josh Richardson all are big enough to play up in position, and knowing Dwyane Wade already has spent some time in smaller lineups at small forward, I don't think it would be outrageous to see something, in limited doses, like Whiteside, Green, Wade, Winslow and Goran Dragic. In fact, I'm sure at the start of training camp, Erik Spoelstra will emphasize position-less and go from there. But the reality is that with Chris Bosh, Josh McRoberts and Amar'e Stoudemire on the roster, you also don't want to push aside that level of quality length.\nQ: Shouldn't guys be staying away from LeBron James with training camp being right around the corner? The guy leaves and still tries to maintain a relationship with guys, and he's not even on the team anymore. Don't you find that shady? -- Richard.\nA: Actually, it says something about the bond that players like Wade, Bosh, Chalmers and LeBron built through their four consecutive trips to the NBA Finals and how that bond has endured. There is nothing wrong with friendship transcending business. And let's face it, LeBron will be spending an awful lot of time in the Cleveland area in coming months, so why not maximize his time in South Florida when possible? The one part I can't get over is that he bailed on these same players for a perceived greater chance of success with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and others in Cleveland (and enough about \"going home\" and any other sentimental b.s.). I'm surprised that doesn't resonate a bit more with those he left behind, even if they are friends.\nQ: Is there any chance of the Heat making a move for Anthony Bennett if he is bought out by the Timberwolves, as has been reported? -- Blake.\nA: Based on the composition of the Heat's roster, and based on the win-now status of the team, I'm not sure it would be the best landing spot for a player leaving salary on the table. Now, if you're saying that Bennett is a small forward, then there could be something said about taking out insurance at the position. But, remember, the Heat are extremely limited in what they could offer because of their position against the luxury tax.\nSeptember 21, 2015\nQ: Could the Heat trade Chris Andersen, Mario Chalmers and a second-round pick for Brandon Jennings, as a backup point guard to Goran Dragic? -- Lorenzo, Albany, N.Y.\nA: I guess they \"could.\" But I'm not sure what Detroit's motivation would be in such a deal. The reason I'm including this question, when, as a rule, I generally don't address trade questions, because they're so speculative, is to make a point: This rarely is a time you see trades, because teams' rosters already are bursting, well beyond regular-season limits. The preseason and training camp is when teams see if they have developed their own low-costs diamonds in the rough, players who have been working out in teams' gyms for weeks, if not months. The first legitimate rounds of trade talks tend to come when teams recognize what they don't have, either because of a talent deficit or because of injuries. Even from a Heat perspective, this is when they get a definitive look at what Josh Richardson, Justise Winslow and even Tyler Johnson and James Ennis can do against NBA competition, not mere summer-league fodder. Then they can assess what they do or do not need going forward. Beyond that, players signed this offseason (other than draft picks) cannot be dealt until Dec. 15, at the earliest. So the pool of players who currently can be put into play is rather limited.\nQ: I would much rather wait to see what Josh Richardson, Corey Hawkins and Tyler Johnson bring to the team than John Lucas III being signed. I hope this isn't a sign that Mario Chalmers is getting put back on the trading block. -- Robert, Alexandria, Va.\nA: I don't believe Lucas has much, if anything, to do with Chalmers. But I do think it must have been interesting this past week for Chalmers to show up on the practice court at AmericanAirlines Arena and see the Heat were also looking at another pair of point guards, in Lucas and Tre Kelley. I also believe there is some validity of your point of Lucas possibly taking reps from players who need time at point guard, in Johnson and Richardson. It will be interesting to see if the experiment with Johnson at the point continues during training camp, or if the Heat have moved in another direction.\nQ: When we released Henry Walker, I was really surprised. I really felt he can be a solid rotation player, getting maybe 10, 12 minutes per game with our improved roster. Listen, I know people say he shot a low percentage and shot too much. He was forced to take so many low-percentage, end-of-shot-clock shots because we were that bad. He is a solid shooter, especially when open, showed he has the guts to take big shots, obviously. I'd take Walker over James Ennis any day. Thoughts? -- Damian, New York.\nA: I think the Walker-Ennis decision was primarily about youth. There also is the reality that if the Heat need/want to revisit Walker, he should be available when/if that time comes.\nSeptember 20, 2015\nQ: Why so many guards for the Heat? I'm pretty sure we need a depth of shooters. -- Daryl.\nA: I agree, right now, if the Heat finalize camp invitation to John Lucas III and Tre Kelley, it would give them 10 players on the roster capable of playing guard. Similarly, the Heat have eight players capable of playing in the power rotation, when counting Hassan Whiteside, Chris Bosh, Josh McRoberts, Amar'e Stoudemire, Chris Andersen, Udonis Haslem, Greg Whittington and Keith Benson. What this team needs is wings, especially amid the concern of whether Justise Winslow is big enough to play small forward as a rookie. Otherwise, we're basically talking Luol Deng, Gerald Green and James Ennis as the Heat's options at small forward.\nQ: Off of last season, how could the Heat not lock James Ennis up. He added impact. Yes, he's still raw, but time will show he deserves a deal. -- K-man.\nA: First, based on the 20 players now expected to be invited to camp, James sets up as one of the 15 player most likely to advance to the regular-season roster, assuming he currently stands ahead of Corey Hawkins, John Lucas III, Tre Kelley, Keith Benson and Greg Whittington. Except. Except that Ennis' contract now calls for him to be guaranteed for the season if he is on the opening-night roster. And I'm just not sure that the Heat are eager to guarantee that 15th roster spot. Because of that, I would not be surprised to see the Heat and Ennis again agree to amend his contract, this time to make it a basic, non-guaranteed deal that does not become guaranteed until when all NBA contracts become guaranteed on Jan. 10. That might give Ennis his best chance of making the opening-night roster. Well, either that or having a breakout training camp.\nQ: We need perimeter defense and 3-point shooting, which are things Mario Chalmers can provide. He has hit clutch threes over his career here that were important to winning many games, including playoffs. He is usually the team leader in steals and is tall and long enough to guard most point guards and even many shooting guards. Chalmers fits what we need off the bench in a combo guard. Hopefully we will hold onto him until Josh Richardson or Tyler Johnson beats him out. -- Dave.\nA: I agree. Amid all the luxury-tax speculation, Mario enters camp as the third-best guard on this roster, behind only Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic. To discard him in the name of tax savings would immediately put the Heat in a precarious backcourt position.\nSeptember 19, 2015\nQ: John Lucas? For what? What can he bring? Nothing. -- Ryan.\nA: What he brings is a veteran alternative in case a deal becomes available to move Mario Chalmers. As it is, the Heat appear set at point guard with Goran Dragic, Chalmers and then either Tyler Johnson or Josh Richardson swinging to the position. But if Chalmers is dealt in the name of tax savings, then it would leave the Heat without a veteran presence for the games Dragic might miss. I think this is a case of the Heat buying time, being able to keep Lucas around for a month while seeing if a market opens for Chalmers. While Pat Riley has rarely favored undersized point guards, Lucas has had his moments against the Heat with several opponents. He also was effective while in camp with the Heat during the 2009 preseason. For now, he's a longshot. But this also is a time you can carry up to 20 players, before having to trim to a maximum of 15 for the regular season. So why John Lucas III? Right now, why not?\nQ: Ira, with Lucas the Heat only have one spot left for camp. I you could, what type of player do you think they should add? -- Amp.\nA: It's interesting, I was speaking with someone involved with the league just the other day whose first question to me about the Heat was, \"How are they going to space the floor with that starting lineup?\" The problem for me with adding a 3-point shooter is that I'm not sure there is a 3-point shooter, at this point, good enough to displace anyone currently in the starting lineup, when counting Hassan Whiteside, Chris Bosh, Luol Deng, Goran Dragic and Dwyane Wade. For me, the 3-point shooting in that lineup is going to have to come by committee, with Deng, Bosh and Dragic all contributing. What I think the Heat need is one more defensive wing, someone who can work with Deng as a defensive stopper. I'm just not sure the Heat have anyone with such credentials beyond Luol.\nQ: When are we signing Beasley? -- Sebastian.\nA: Well, the Heat waited until mid September in 2013 and even later last season. But this time, if it was going to get done, I would think it would have been done by now. Basically, the Heat are going to leave that role open for James Ennis either to sink or swim during the preseason. What Ennis needs is an extended opportunity. Without Beasley in camp, it provides Ennis more of that opportunity.\nSeptember 18, 2015\nQ: This season, believe it or not, I am most excited to see what Luol Deng will accomplish. Last season, he was to asked to do too much I think. I expect him to play well for a new contract for next year and can be more of a glue guy for the starting lineup with his play. Also, I expect him to help Justise Winslow grow. What are your thoughts on what we need from him this year? -- Henry, Sunny Isles.\nA: I'm going to go in a bit of a different direction: I actually think Luol wasn't asked to do enough. No, not on the defensive end, where he was asked to take challenge from point guard to power forward, often as the Heat's lone true perimeter stopper. He has to continue to excel in that role, considering the roster's lack of alternatives. But all too often he was reduced to spot-up 3-point shooter, in part due to the Heat's lack of alternatives in the starting lineup. What made Luol so effective during his time with the Bulls was his ability to move without the ball, to keep the defense honest, to create easy scores at the rim. The Heat need to get Luol back in motion again, to be aware of his baseline and lane cuts, to make that a featured part of the offense. He simply is too valuable from an offensive standpoint to be parked in a corner.\nQ: Hear me out: I'm not saying that the Heat should be eager to get rid of Udonis Haslem or that he, himself, should be eager to retire. However, for the past two years UD has been a defensive minus and just last year the Heat were about five points worse on offense with him on the court. A lot seems to have been made about Mario Chalmers (and I've had my problems with 'Rio, too) and Birdman being too expensive to keep, when Udonis himself is making near $3 million dollars. And I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that Chalmers and Bird are much more valuable on the court to Miami than Haslem at this point, and yet they're the ones being talked about as trade targets. I don't want to undervalue loyalty to a player or having someone who is a vocal leader; but what does Udonis Haslem bring to the Heat other than being a strong bench/locker room presence? -- Bryan, Mountain View, Calif.\nA: First, to get past the emotional and loyalty issues, another reality is that moving Haslem's salary likely would be more difficult than moving Chris Andersen or Chalmers. So there's that. Beyond that, based on the depth of the power rotation, when including Hassan Whiteside, Chris Bosh, Amar'e Stoudemire, Josh McRoberts and Birdman, it's not as if Haslem will have a rotation role, anyway. So what you're asking is whether having Haslem or a neophyte as a 13th man is preferable. With the youth of Winslow, Tyler Johnson, Josh Richardson and possibly James Ennis, there is something to be said about having a mentor on the roster. So the real question is whether the Heat roster can afford such a luxury. And that could come down to the relative health of the balance of the roster.\nQ: Ira, I like that Gerald Green still has his hops . . . but so did Harold Miner when he was here. What I want to know if it he can defend and become the Heat's go-to 3-point shooter. -- Jack.\nA: I agree that Green's playing time could ultimately come down to his defense. He was told as much when signed, and mentioned it as his primary focus. But that doesn't mean enjoying the occasional highlight dunk won't be fun, too.\nSeptember 17, 2015\nQ: With only 13 players in uniform during the regular season, who doesn't dress out for the Heat? -- Martin.\nA: First, just to again be in the position where this matters says something about the type of depth the Heat appeared to lack last season. We basically know the first five will be Hassan Whiteside, Chris Bosh, Luol Deng, Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic, with the next group off the bench to include Amar'e Stoudemire, Gerald Green, Josh McRoberts, Justise Winslow, and, at least for now, Mario Chalmers. So that's 10. Then there figures to be spot duty for Chris Andersen, Tyler Johnson and Udonis Haslem. So based on that math, and based on the 15 most likely, at the moment, to emerge from camp, I'd say it could leave Josh Richardson and James Ennis on the outs on game nights. But that doesn't mean that Richardson couldn't emerge ahead of Johnson at times in light of the potential need for perimeter defense at point guard, or that Ennis couldn't be active on nights when opponents clearly are playing small, thereby mitigating the need to have both Birdman and Haslem active. When the issue is which two have to inactive, rather than coming up with 13 players worthy of being active, it says you're in a better place, sort of where the Heat previously were on those nights they couldn't find an active spot for the likes of a James Jones.\nQ: I didn't even know the Heat had a say in starting times. I thought the NBA ran that. -- Mike.\nA: Yes, the home team always can opt for what time to start night games, with the preference by the Heat, for the most part, previously to go with 7:30 p.m. other than Sundays, when most games have started at 6 p.m. (the earliest you can start a game when one of the teams has played the previous night). Because the decision to experiment with Friday and Saturday games at 8 p.m. came after the schedule was issued, permission had to be receive on a game-by-game basis from both the opposing team and the national networks. I can appreciated the difficulties for those in Broward and Palm Beach (or even those in south Dade) to make the 7;30 starts in traffic, with the 8 p.m. starts not impacting work or school days the next day. Still, it will be interesting to see if the typically late-arriving Heat crowds now will be more likely to be in their seats for the opening tip. Perhaps what the Heat should have done is moved the game to 8 p.m. starts and not told anyone.\nQ: So you're suggesting the Heat build around a 30-year-old and a guy who had a good half season? Good luck. -- Jeremy.\nA: That not what I said. First, I believe the Heat, after last season's lottery finish, are in a live-in-the-moment state. So what I said in yesterday's answer was that the best way to maximize the moment is to work through the two elements that can make this team different from last season's team: having a defensive backstop who likes to \"dunk on people\" in Hassan Whiteside, and the type of playmaker who can get the Heat to play at speed, in Goran Dragic.\nSeptember 16, 2015\nQ: Hey Ira, I can't begin to describe how excited I am about this upcoming season. However, the one thing that concerns me is whether or not Erik Spoelstra will get the best out of his players. If the Heat are going to go far, then everyone needs to be engaged on offense and defensive schemes. Should Spoelstra consider adopting a different coaching method? -- Daryl, Fitzgerald, Ga.\nA: I believe he will. For as much of a game-changer as Hassan Whiteside can be defensively, the Heat never had the opportunity to adjust the defensive system with so many players coming and going last season due to injury, illness and personnel moves. Similarly, for as capable as Goran Dragic is of playing at speed, his running partners constantly changed last season. This is the first Heat training camp for both Whiteside and Dragic. That means this also is the first time Spoelstra will have an extended period to incorporate their unique skill sets into a definitive game plan. One of the problems last season was that Josh McRoberts and Danny Granger were not up to speed in training camp, so the Heat therefore couldn't get up to speed with their possibilities. I believe that training camp should be all about Whiteside and Dragic, about building on each end (Whiteside on defense, Dragic on offense) around their skill sets. Players such as Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and Luol Deng, with their veteran experience, all then should have the ability to adapt from there.\nQ: I know Pat Riley will wait to see what shakes out, but why not a veteran minimum deal for John Salmons? Yes, he is long in the tooth, but he is a decent team defender who would benefit from having Whiteside behind him; he is a pretty good 3-point shooter, particularly from the corner; he is a good passer; he would complement a team that already has slashers; he is not a project, i.e. a good fit for a team in \"win now mode.\" -- David.\nA: That is exactly the type of name I'm talking about. This team has such questionable depth (so many players either returning from injury, dealing with age, lacking in a particularly skill set or a neophyte) that I would rather have one more veteran to choose from than a young player instead. I agree with your thinking, if not specifically the player. I'm just not sure if the Heat do.\nQ: After seeing Dwyane Wade wearing a Jets jersey this past weekend, I could care less if the Heat finish dead last for the next decade. -- Christian.\nA: OK, that's a bit extreme, since he did it more out of friendship with Brandon Marshall than an abiding desire to see the Jets go 16-0 and win the division over the Dolphins. But I do believe it is wise to always keep your constituency in mind. It is one thing to wear the color of your hometown team, with Wade a diehard Bears fan. It is another to post on Instagram a photo in the dreaded (at least in most of South Florida) green and white.\nSeptember 15, 2015\nQ: Dwyane Wade achieves his scoring average (when he plays) by saving energy on offense through the first three quarters, on defense for three-plus quarters and regularly in transition (often just walking up, jogging back, or entirely \"out of the picture”). Then he \"takes over\" and plays hero ball at the end of games, breaking the flow of the offense and leaving his teammates standing around watching. If he plays in a similar manner going forward, is there any way the Heat can truly be contenders? Also, what are the chances he adjusts his game, sacrificing some points and end-of-game ball dominance, toward more complete and consistent efforts? Is he aware of the issue? Does he care? He deferred to LeBron James, but what of Goran Dragic/Chris Bosh? He did seem to enjoy feeding Hassan Whiteside. -- David, Seoul, Korea.\nA: I believe that one of the most difficult transitions in all of sports, including the NBA, is appreciating when to defer to the next generation. It's something Kobe Bryant seemingly never truly accepted and something Dwyane certainly has to consider. It is something that Tim Duncan essentially wrote the book on. The second part of the equation is having a coaching/management structure that can get such a star to buy in to what must come next. For years now, including this one, Dwyane has spoken of proving himself against the skeptics. But this is not about skeptics. This is about a team with a revised roster (and salary structure) that no longer can (or needs to) be reliant on a single aging star. What the Heat need are consistently productive minutes from Dwyane as part of the overall package. With LeBron and Bosh, there was an acceptance of the Big Three beginning their era somewhat as equals, before the scheme was designed around LeBron. Now the Heat must let this new roster emerge organically, to see where it heads. Sometimes leadership can be achieved through deferring, and that certainly could be the case with Dwyane. Leadership also comes through example, and I agree that it has to come consistently on more than just one end of the court and for more than one quarter a game. It will be interesting to see Dwyane's approach during this next chapter of his career. The short-term future of the Heat hangs in that balance.\nQ: Hello, Ira. I am worried about the defensive capabilities of the secondary unit. With all but one or two on the second team known for their abysmal defense, is it possible to move a well-known defensive presence like Udonis Haslem or Luol Deng to the second unit? -- Perry, Davie.\nA: I don't think you can take Luol out of the first unit, because that unit needs a perimeter stopper, as well. And I'm not sure with a power rotation of Hassan Whiteside, Chris Bosh, Josh McRoberts, Amare Stoudemire and Chris Andersen that Haslem gets on the floor very much, if at all. What I don't think you do is play Stoudemire, McRoberts, Gerald Green, Tyler Johnson and Justise Winslow as a unit. I think Erik Spoelstra will cycle through to try to keep his defensive best on the court when the opposition have their offensive best on the floor. This roster allows for a lot of mixing and matching. Spoelstra will have to be a mix master.\nQ: If the Cavaliers believed LeBron will not break their hearts a second time by not being forced into a deal with Tristan Thompson, and Pat Riley kind of called Dwyane Wade's bluff, have we seen the last of teams being held hostage by their players? -- Carlos, Miami.\nA: Well, considering Wade got a $4 million pay increase, it's not as if he came out on the short end. But with the tax becoming so punitive in the \"repeater\" stage, I believe the equation is changing. Contenders will go over the cap. Contenders will go into the tax. But what we've learned this summer is that contenders will not live in the tax, because the calculus shows that taking up such permanent residence ultimately could eliminate them as contenders.\nSeptember 14, 2015\nQ: There are rumors I'm hearing about the Knicks putting Carmelo Anthony on the trade block. Now if, and a very big \"if,\" the Knicks are open to trading Melo, do you think the Heat can acquire Melo? I was guessing we can offer up Luol Deng, Birdman, and a draft pick. -- Earl, Jersey City.\nA: While I am loathe to address rumors, this might be the right time to address how little the Heat have to offer that would be attractive the rebuilding teams. The Heat have precious few prospects to offer, and, by league rule, are prohibited from trading future draft picks for the remainder of this decade, because of outstanding picks still due. So if they Knicks do look to move Carmelo, about all I can see the Heat having as attractive to New York would be Hassan Whiteside, Justise Winslow and enough salary-cap filler to make the math work.\nQ: It s eems to me that the big difference between this coming season and the fateful downfall of 2013-14 is this year literally everyone on the roster has something to prove. During LeBron James' last season, having made the NBA Finals three successive times and captured two titles, the team was playing for pride, having the satisfaction of proving themselves champions. But when others doubt you (untested newcomers, veterans resurrecting careers, returning from injuries or simply growing old) the fire of fighting back becomes the hunger needed to endure the long season grind. Even the coaches facing a radically different roster must again prove themselves. That may prove to be the decisive factor in success. -- Jack, Fort Myers.\nA: Except they also had those same motivations last season, and, in a large part due to injury, it only led them to the lottery. During last year's preseason, all the talk was about proving they could succeed after losing LeBron. It was about Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade showing they again could emerge as leaders. It was about Luol Deng resurrecting his career. It was about Erik Spoelstra coming up with a new, non-LeBron-centric system. \"Motivation\" certainly is a reasonable place to start. But it's still about talent, productivity, execution, system and health. The Heat simply need to play better. The real question could be whether they have better players this season than last season.\nQ: I am not worried about 3-point shooting because we have players who can drive to the basket, which should give wide-open kick-out threes. Not too many teams have a 6-10 power forward that can shoot threes with a center that gobbles offensive rebounds. However, challenging defensively at the 3-point line is an issue. -- Leif, Cooper City.\nA: On your first point, just because you are standing wide-open at the 3-point line doesn't mean you're going to convert the shot. The Heat had plenty of open 3-pointers last season. And missed plenty, because there was no Ray Allen, James Jones, Mike Miller or Shane Battier. They need someone who can cash in. I'm still not sold they have that on the wing. As for 3-point defense, I think it as much about system as players. If the Heat continue to swarm the pick-and-roll, there still will be open 3-point looks on the weak side. It's simple math.\nSeptember 13, 2015\nQ: Goran Dragic will need to justify his $85 million contract. -- Aura.\nA: You know, sort of like those questions a year ago about whether Chris Bosh would justify his $118 million contract? While salary figures matter in a salary-cap league, market dynamics do not always equate to productivity expectations. Bosh got his deal a year ago because the Heat had to act quickly and decisively in the wake of LeBron James' free-agency defection. And relative to his performance, he well could stand as overpaid, although the new television money should add perspective. As for Dragic, he actually could have forced the Heat's hand for far more. So an argument could be made that the Heat already have realized value on his contract. Just wait until you see what equivalent players get under the new cap. What Dragic has to be is a point guard who meshes with this team, just as Bosh has to do at his position. In fact, what really has to happen is Bosh-Dragic has to become special in the pick-and-roll. That could make the financial math with their deals even more palatable.\nQ: Hey, Ira, what are the chances for the Heat to acquire a developing point guard in exchange for Birdman? -- Brian, New York.\nA: Before trading Chris Andersen either for need or for luxury-tax savings, I think the Heat first have to make the determination of whether they can afford to be without him. If, indeed, the plan is to play bigger with Hassan Whiteside, then there has to be a similar type of player for the times when Whiteside is not available. The player who best fits that description on the current roster is Birdman. Plus, with Amar'e Stoudemire on the roster, keeping Andersen would keep the Heat deep enough in the middle to allow Chris Bosh to focus solely at power forward.\nQ: I feel the Miami Heat have one of the best second units in the East with Gerald Green, Justise Winslow, Amar'e Stoudemire, Josh McRoberts and Mario Chalmers. I feel we have a better second unit than Cleveland, as well. Now, with that, do you believe even if our starters are outscored a little in games that our bench and depth is strong enough to get us leads or even win games against elite teams? -- Earl, Jersey City, N.J.\nA: I'm not ready to overstate the Heat bench yet, with just about every component with a question mark, be it injury, inexperience or inconsistency. But I also never overstate the notion of a second unit. This Heat roster is top heavy, with it almost assured that multiple members of the starting lineup will be on the court at just about any time. What the Heat need from their bench are steady contributions for some or many on a given night. But counting on each of the names you mentioned for night-in, night-out contributions might be a stretch.\nSeptember 12, 2015\nQ: Should we be worried about Hassan Whiteside's mentality? He seems so focused on making himself look better, that he might forget it's the team that is important. His words don't inspire confidence that he fits into the Heat culture. -- Scott, Los Angeles.\nA: It's always interesting when you get to this point off the offseason, three months after the last game (five months after, in the Heat's case) and you start to look at every possible thing that could go wrong. Yes, Hassan has had his share of social-media fun in the offseason. And, yes, he is rather confident. But none of that matters if the proper focus is in place come the start of the season. So the real question this season instead will be whether Whiteside will become too focused on his next contract. And that's a fine line. On one hand, team success will cast Whiteside in the best overall light. On the other, the expectations are of similar numbers to the ones he produced last season, when, for the most part, both Chris Bosh and Josh McRoberts were out. And it's not as if the Heat can assure him that they will take care of him regardless of his statistics, because the Heat may not have the needed salary-cap space to back up such a promise.\nQ: Chris Bosh is looking huge. Do you think he will trim down before the season starts? If not, do you think his added mass will affect his outside game/mobility? And knees? Last time he played at such weight he said he didn't like it. Maybe he was getting tired of being pushed around by Hassan Whiteside in practice. -- Yunasi, Miami Beach.\nA: This has been a different offseason for Chris, limited in his approach due to the blood clots on his lung that cut short last season. What will matter most is what he looks like after training camp, with the expectation of being back up to speed for camp. I would think the Heat would want him to be as agile as possible, with Whiteside, Chris Andersen (at least for the moment) and Amar'e Stoudemire all capable of playing in the middle. But with so much time off while on blood thinners, I'm not sure the Chris Bosh we see at the start of the season will be the same Bosh we see once he gets fully back into a basketball groove.\nQ: How much does it say about Mario Chalmers that there was basically no interest for him throughout the league? -- Bryan, Mountain View, Calif.\nA: It says more about the league. This is a time of year when teams' rosters are bulging, with more players under contract than can be retained at the start of the season. For the moment, teams are more concerned about seeing what works among those already on their rosters, especially players at minimal salaries. A market for Chalmers is more likely to develop when teams realize what they might not have, when players at his position are injured, or when players who were injured don't prove up to the challenge during camp. When it comes to luxury-tax transactions it's early, very early.\nSeptember 11, 2015\nQ: I believe the Heat's issues with perimeter defense can be addressed internally, with focus, effort and discipline, especially with Dwyane Wade and Gerald Green. -- Jose.\nA: And that could be the case. With Wade, it is a matter of whether he still is capable of exerting energy on both ends of the court, and for how long (he generally has done a nice job defensively late in close games). With Green, I'm not so sure that such a turnaround is possible, based on his career body of work. But I do agree that it is easier to address the defensive concerns through a systematic approach, especially with a backstop like Hassan Whiteside as the last line of defense. I'm not as sold that the Heat's 3-point concerns, especially from the perimeter players, can be addressed through any type of systematic approach. And that remains a concern. And that might not be able to be handled internally.\nQ: Ira, what's with these D-League affiliate signings? Why go for bread crumbs here and there, when by signing one or two legitimate and experienced players we can go for the complete meal? But then again, it could be the matter of saving on the taxes. Correct? -- Matt, Tucson, Ariz.\nA: When it comes to some of the recently added players, such as Greg Whittington, Keith Benson, Corey Hawkins and Briante Weber, the tax isn't a factor, because even a veteran brought in would come with the same minimum-salary hit against the cap and tax, as long as a similar one-year deal was offered. I think the moves were done more with an eye on perhaps uncovering a diamond in the rough, or at least being able to continue to monitor the prospects on their D-League affiliate. Now, if the Heat were to trade a veteran making more than the minimum, that type of move would be with the tax in mind. Again, I'm not sure the Heat will even keep a 15th man, with 14 players entering camp with guarantees.\nQ: I know I'm a little bit late on this, but Justise Winslow better be good. The Celtics apparently offered the Heat the 15th and 16th picks of this year's draft, an unprotected pick from Brooklyn (which has a solid chance of being a high pick) and another first-round pick down the line. This year, the Heat could've had their pick of Sam Dekker, Bobby Portis, Tyus Jones, etc., and the future picks could've compensated for the picks traded away for Goran Dragic. Though this year should be fun, I am concerned about some years out. By 2018, Dwyane Wade should be retired and Chris Bosh and Goran Dragic will be in their mid 30s. Pat Riley may also be retired. The Heat will basically have Winslow, maybe Hassan Whiteside and almost no draft picks. That deal with the Celtics would have helped a lot. Unless that is, Winslow turns out to be very, very good. Wonder what your thoughts are. -- Mike, Fort Lauderdale.\nA: My thoughts are how surprising it is that so many who raved about the Winslow pick in June now are having second thoughts. When it comes to big moments, Pat Riley goes all in. We already know that. Whether it was giving up all those first-round picks to close out the signings of the Big Three in 2010, or the picks dealt to the Suns for Dragic, it has never been about quantity to Riley when it comes to the opportunity for quality. I still believe the questions with the Winslow selection will not be about the potential picks bypassed, but rather bypassing the 3-point shooting of Devin Booker. But, for now, exhale. The Heat came out of the draft with Justise Winslow at No. 10. That seemed like a heck of a result on draft night, and there is absolutely no reason it should seem like anything less now.\nSeptember 10, 2015\nQ: Justise Winslow isn't really big enough to play small forward on a consistent basis but he's definitely big enough to have a good size advantage on a lot of NBA shooting guards. I'd understand if he didn't have the ballhandling skills to play shooting guard, but we saw in summer league that his handles are actually pretty nice. If he reaches his full potential, it could even answer the question of what Miami does post-Dwyane Wade. Why wouldn't the Heat want to groom Winslow as a shooting guard? --- Bryant, Mountain View, Calif.\nA: Because it is far more likely that the Heat will go forward after this season with Dwyane Wade back at shooting guard than with Luol Deng back at small forward. And while I know that some are pointing to Kevin Durant as the Heat's next small forward, let's also keep it real here for a moment. But your point is well made about Winslow showing a skill set similar to Wade in terms of his ability to get to the rim off the dribble. Of course, that also only was summer league, so perspective is needed. But there are concerns with \"tweeners\" at both positions. While Winslow would appear to be undersized at small forward, there could be issues with his defensive quickness at shooting guard. And you know what? None of that matters. What Winslow needs to show is that he eventually can emerge as an NBA starter. Then it will be up to the coaching staff to find a way to best maximize his possibilities. \"Position-less\" has worked before for the Heat; with Winslow, it might have to work again. The entire NBA knew Winslow would be entering the league as a 'tweener. Now it's all about molding the lump of clay.\nQ: What if Hassan Whiteside doesn't pan out as expected? I personally believe in him, but what do you think the Heat should do if he just doesn't work? Do the Heat have a backup plan? -- Perry, Davie.\nA: No. Just as they didn't have a backup plan if Chris Bosh missed half of last season, or if Dwyane Wade missed a quarter of a season. And it's the same for most teams in the NBA: lose a key player or two and you're basically screwed (just ask the Cavaliers in the Finals). Whiteside is a huge part of this season and, the Heat hope, going forward. There really isn't a Plan B if he doesn't pan out. But that's also the case if Bosh doesn't return to full health, or if Goran Dragic doesn't live up to his new contract. You can only have so many backup plans when you are paying so much to your prime players under a salary cap. Backup plans? Those would be Birdman, Amar'e Stoudemire, Gerald Green and perhaps still Mario Chalmers.\nQ: The Heat's obsession with Kevin Durant seems misplaced to me. I am reluctant to break up a team and pay top dollar for a superstar who has foot problems. Hope I am wrong. -- Leon. Miami\nA: I'm not sure there is an \"obsession,\" but rather teams subtly creating hoping while not actually addressing the odds of such a pursuit. Durant, as with all impending 2016 free agents, will be judged on their play this coming season. That will set the market. And the Heat by no means will be \"breaking up\" a team. There is a plan in place to get close enough to a max slot to at least draw the notice of a top free agent.\nSeptember 9, 2015\nQ: Several returning players and the new draftees will have something to prove this season, but perhaps the greatest challenges face Erik Spoelstra. Two years ago, James could cover deficiencies by himself and last year Spoelstra scrambled to fill multiple holes off the bench from the D-League. An entirely different issue confronts the coaching staff this year. With an embarrassment of riches (on paper), the success or failure of the coming season will fall squarely on Spoelstra's ability to mesh talent and optimize individual strengths, while finding the right matchups to counter opponent strengths and exploit weaknesses. That plus switching between going small or big and up-tempo or slowdowns will test his creative flexibility. Keeping a stable of max-contract and minimum-salary ring chasers happy will be no small task, either. The task before him is daunting but may mark his rise to the elite ranks of coaching talent that up to this point has been questioned by a few skeptics who prefer to give credit to the Big Three and Pat Riley's management of the roster. -- Jack, Fort Myers.\nA: Actually, I think Spoelstra has already shown he can manage players, simply by surviving the Big Three era (as the Cavaliers have shown, forging any type of peace with LeBron James and his people is not the easiest enterprise). And I believe he has shown an ability to adapt to the moment strategically, as he did during several of those Big Three seasons. But I agree that he was given a pass early when he inherited a team coming off a 15-67 season and then when he was afforded the opportunity of having LeBron there, as you point out, to clean up any issues. So what this season is about is this: Erik Spoelstra has never won a playoff series without LeBron on his roster. Now he has the type of talent that should lead to success, even without LeBron. So, now, yes, he very much should be on the clock. And very much has to produce something beyond merely making the playoffs. Wade, Bosh, Dragic, Deng and Whiteside should get you more than just a mere playoff berth. Shouldn't it?\nQ: Ira, I really liked our Skyforce D-League players from last season. Are any of them ready to claim the 15th roster spot? I'm especially curious about Fuquan Edwin, Khem Birch, Scotty Hopson, Andre Dawkins, and Larry Drew II? -- David, Miami.\nA: I, too, was curious that none of the Skyforce players from 2014-15 were on the Heat's summer-league roster. I was told it was because they wanted to look at some fresh faces. And even then, Greg Whittington was the only free agent brought back from summer league. Drew has signed to play overseas, as have Dawkins, Birch and Edwin. Hopson is still working out with other NBA players looking for work.\nQ: What is your best guess for a date of the return of Michael Beasley to the Heat? I'm betting on November, Friday the 13th. -- John, Miami.\nA: Not Halloween?\nSeptember 8, 2015\nQ: What is your prediction for Hassan Whiteside? If he puts up the same numbers as last year he should be named an All-Star, with really no competition at center besides maybe Greg Monroe, right? -- Phillip, West Palm Beach.\nA: Only the rules have changed, with forwards and centers lumped together as \"frontcourt\" players when it comes to the voting. And you know that LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony are going to get their automatic votes from the fans in the East, with Kevin Love and Jimmy Butler also maintaining strong followings. Beyond that, many fans might automatically go with Dwyane Wade as their Heat ballot selection, creating pause about just how many players from the team fans would choose among their five starting choices. Then, when it comes to the coaches rounding out the All-Star rosters, Whiteside's comportment could factor into those decisions, as could some coaches weighing the merits of Chris Bosh vs. Whiteside. Whiteside's best chance is for the Heat to maximize their favorable early schedule and then put the heat on voters to consider all of team's possibilities.\nQ: With all the young faces on the Heat this year, I'm getting the impression that Pat Riley might be hoping he'll find another Hassan Whiteside in the group. Are the Heat prepping themselves with future talent and is this part of Pat Riley's exit plan? -- Rodney, Sarasota.\nA: First, I don't believe there is any Riley exit plan. I also see just about every neophyte added as being added more with the D-League in mind. I still think there is a chance the Heat could break camp with a 14-player roster. And remember, Whiteside was not even with the Heat last year in training camp. So the next young player developed by the Heat could be a player already committed to camp with another team.\nQ: So with the Heat training-camp roster at 19 players, what is the likelihood of Briante Weber grabbing a 15th roster spot for the regular season? And if not him, who is the likely candidate in your opinion of the non-incumbent players? -- James, Miami.\nA: Again, I'm not sure any of the free-agent kids make the team. Keep in mind, with draft picks Justise Winslow and Josh Richardson, you already are injecting a pair of rookies in the mix, with both fully guaranteed for the season. But if someone does make a statement in camp, it could be Corey Hawkins with his 3-point shooting, just as Andre Dawkins caught the Heat's attention with his 3-point shooting in camp last year.\nSeptember 7, 2015\nQ: James Ennis, I love his enthusiasm, devotion, but ballhandling skill is his Achilles heel, and the structure of the Heat does/did not address the issue. Playing in summer league did no good. Based on this roster, he will be left behind. What a pity. -- L.G.\nA: I would not be surprised, with 13 fully guaranteed contracts and with Tyler Johnson's partially guaranteed deal, if the Heat open the season either without a 15th player, or with someone not on a guaranteed deal, perhaps cycling through a variety of players with that roster spot. Ennis could elect to bypass his guarantee in order to remain on more of a game-by-game basis, or the Heat could take an extended look at one of their undrafted free agents in camp, perhaps sending one of those players to the D-League while he remains under guaranteed contract. There could be something to be said about retaining flexibility with that roster spot, as long as the Heat believe they have enough depth at small forward. And I believe that remains a question mark.\nQ: You express surprise at the number of untested \"neophytes\" on the training-camp roster given the \"win now\" mode the team is in. The Heat's roster is one of the oldest in the league and can set an eight-man rotation without using any young players. Since the Heat have traded away all their first-round and most of their second-round picks for the foreseeable future, it seems prudent to make room for some promising rookies. Especially since it is most likely that this team will make the playoffs and seeding is not nearly as important as peaking in March (just ask Toronto). By giving regular season minutes to the young players, a couple might show great upside potential and be valuable in trade for a veteran who could fit the \"win now mode\". -- Jack, Fort Myers.\nA: I guess where I disagree is that I don't necessarily see the playoffs as a \"given,\" nor do I believe that \"seeding is not nearly as important.\" Look, this team has an impressive starting lineup. But it also has questions when it comes to 3-point shooting and perimeter defense. Plus, there remain issues with the depth. And I simply don't think any of the end-of-the-camp-roster players they added will compensate for first- or second-round picks. So I still would like to see a veteran wing added, especially someone with a defensive pedigree. To me \"future\" and \"Riley\" are like oil and water. I'm not sure they'll ever mix.\nQ: Could Henry Walker return? -- Sam.\nA: Possibly, just not for training camp, not with 19 roster spots already filled. But if Henry returns to the D-League, it certainly is possible the Heat would keep him in mind if injuries again become an issue. I don't think he did anything wrong.\nSeptember 6, 2015\nQ: Do you think Justise Winslow will get playing time this season? He's pushing himself hard for a rotation spot. -- Dan.\nA: I think this will be one of the most intriguing questions of camp. For all that Justise showed during Duke's run to the NCAA championship and then with the Heat in summer league, that still was just college and summer league. And some of it could be beyond Justise's control, such as if Gerald Green cements the backup spot at shooting guard and if Mario Chalmers is still around to claim minutes in the perimeter rotation. There has to be more than just the dribble-attack game that Justise showed in Orlando. Making shots will be significant, as will an ability to offer NBA-level deterrence as a perimeter defender. For many of the Heat's veterans, training camp will be a means of easing into the season. For Justise, it will be a proving ground. The ball is in his court.\nQ: Is Joshua Smith the only name being mentioned for the last spot in training camp? If so, then James Ennis as the 15th spot is basically a lock. -- Jose.\nA: First, I am surprised that the Heat have locked in a camp roster with so many neophytes, especially at such a win-now juncture for the franchise. Then again, with the possibilities of trades before or during camp, spots could yet come open. All of that said, Greg Whittington clearly outplayed Ennis during summer league. While they don't play the same position, that still could be a factor. And camp rosters also remain fluid. As long as a player has spent more time with the Heat in their camp than another camp, he still remains eligible for direct D-League assignment to the Heat's affiliate. So the Heat could yet pick up an NBA veteran cut by another team and still be able to steer the current young players on the camp roster to Sioux Falls. Much still remains in play before guaranteeing Ennis' roster spot or salary for the season. And even that term in Ennis' contract could still be modified, so he doesn't get his full salary if on the opening-night roster, as currently is the clause. To a degree, that clause could actually come back to hamper his chances.\nQ: So now that we know that Samuel L. Jackson is Kevin Durant's favorite actor, is that why he was at that dinner with Pat Riley and Micky Arison? -- Michael, Hollywood.\nA: Welcome to the Kevin Durant Speculation Game, where everything and anything will be in play from now through July 1, 2016. Signals. It's all about signals and hints and clues and speculation.\nSeptember 5, 2015\nQ: With Justise Winslow, I love his confidence, but he must be careful of youthful exuberance, We are approaching the big leagues, leaving behind college ball. With Hassan Whiteside, I love his attitude work-wise, and he seems committed. But is there a maturity issue here? I hope we have mature vets who can guide these two diamonds in the rough. -- Leon, Miami.\nA: I agree that both come off as confident, at times almost to the point of cocky. And there is something to be said about that, considering the stakes and the level of competition. I still prefer that to a neophyte entering with a tangible sense of doubt. With Winslow, it will have to be a realization that there still is plenty to learn after a charmed existence as prep All-American and national champ at Duke. With Whiteside, it will be a matter of consistency and doing it over the long run . . . and in the playoffs. Both have significant tests ahead. How they grade out could define the Heat's season. I also agree that leadership from within will be significant this season, with Udonis Haslem the logical mentor for both.\nQ: What about Beasley for the Heat's final roster spot to camp? -- Sebastian.\nA: So I mention that the Heat have filled 19 of the maximum 20 spots for training camp and one name jumps to the top of the mention list on Twitter. While it still could happen (the lesson learned from previous Beasley Heat incarnations is to never rule out the possibility), it seems that the Heat currently are more interested in developmental projects. All of that said, if Justise Winslow and Gerald Green wind up mostly playing guard, a case could be made for Beasley as a fit at small forward. But such a move would only further compromise the Heat's already questionable defense.\nQ: I hope the Heat sign Joshua Smith. He deserves a spot in this league? -- Megan.\nA: This is where I think the NBA fails its teams when it comes to the D-League. Smith is the perfect example of a team devoting summer league and now possibly training camp to a prospect who clearly needs time to develop into an NBA player. But if the Heat do invite Smith to camp, cut him, then directly assign him to their D-League affiliate, they still could lose him to any NBA team should he continue to make progress in the D-League. The question is whether the Heat would dare actually devote an NBA roster spot to Smith while he develops in the D-League. If they do, it would be at the cost of a player such as James Ennis.\nSeptember 4, 2015\nQ: Ira, how come nobody talks about Udonis Haslem? The man has been the heart and soul of this team for years, but he always seems like the outcast? Where is some loyalty and some reward for all that he has done? He has always taken the pay cut to help the team. He is the Heat and has been for years. -- Matt, Tucson, Ariz.\nA: Look, few have shown as enduring a commitment to the Heat as Udonis. And for that, his number will one day be raised to the rafters at AmericanAirlines Arena. But even Pat Riley would be the first to acknowledge that this is business. And part of the business is deciding what is best for the team, which sometimes transcends loyalty. The Heat's best options at center, with this current roster, are Hassan Whiteside, Chris Andersen and Amare Stoudemire. The best options at power forward are Chris Bosh and Josh McRoberts, with Luol Deng possibly seeing minutes there, as well. That's \"with this current roster.\" Now, if Birdman or McRoberts are traded, or if there are injuries, then the permutation changes. And in that case, there still could be a place for Udonis. But when it comes to respect, there also is a reason (beyond contract value) why Mario Chalmers and Birdman are the ones being mentioned for potential tax-savings moves, not Udonis. So there certainly is a degree of ultimate respect there, as well.\nQ: Last season, Mario Chalmers said he was unsure of his role with the Heat. Now Justise Winslow is saying the same thing. Isn't it on the coach to make sure each player knows his role? I doubt any Spurs player has that problem. Thanks. Scott, Los Angeles.\nA: And he will know his role as the Heat and Erik Spoelstra learn his game. You can't fully appreciate the possibilities of any player until he gets out on the court. This is not the case of a proven veteran with a proven skill set trying to establish stability. This is a great unknown, a player with a 'tweener build who well could wind up being a quality defender at one position and a quality offensive weapon at another. And that's fine, too. In fact, I would think it would be a mistake if the Heat told Winslow, \"You will be this,\" at the start of training camp without exploring his possibilities. All Justise was saying Wednesday when we spoke to him was that he was eager to explore his NBA possibilities. I am sure that Spoelstra is equally eager.\nQ: Wouldn't there have been less urgency to unload Chalmers' or Birdman's contracts if Dwyane Wade didn't create unnecessary drama by suddenly opting out of his $16 million salary and threatening to sign elsewhere if Miami doesn't give him a big raise? -- John, Manila.\nA: Or if Chris Bosh had taken less a year ago. Or if the Heat didn't give two-year deals to Chalmers or Andersen in the first place. Basically, the most important thing in managing a cap and the tax is to move past what already has transpired and to best manage the situation going forward. I still think you pay now and consider the situation again closer to the Feb. 18 trading deadline.\nSeptember 3, 2015\nQ: Hey, Ira! With an eye on the Heat defense, is there a possibility of adding another piece even if it is later on down the road? I can't help but think that there will be a need for more defense on the perimeter. Is it possible for Pat Riley to pull off some type of trade before the deadline, if they see Mario Chalmers or Chris Andersen as expendable? -- Ricky, Dallas.\nA: I agree that there are considerable defensive concerns with this roster. Just about every player added in the offseason comes with defensive questions, certainly with Amare Stoudemire and Gerald Green, and also with Justise Winslow, if just from the perspective of his rookie learning curve. While Hassan Whiteside certainly can clean up some of the issues, few of the Heat's perimeter players are considered plus-defenders beyond Luol Deng. So against a team that has a quality small forward and a quality shooting guard (let alone a quick point guard), that leaves the Heat at a net deficit unless Dwyane Wade steps up. Yes, another defensive wing would help, with Winslow the best hope at the moment for a player on this roster stepping forward. As for Chalmers and Birdman, they have been rumored on the trade market not as much as exchangeable assets, but as contracts that could be unloaded to save against the tax. So once you include them in transactions for matching salaries, you might as well include any players on the roster in such permutations.\nQ: Ira, there must be a specific NBA rule that would prevent one of Micky Arison's companies, like Carnival, form cutting an endorsement deal with Dwyane Wade.\nCertainly $20 million per year is not unreasonable for Wade's marketing appeal. Then Wade can sign next year for croutons, opening up cap space. What is that rule? -- T.C.\nA: The rule is that such side deals are strictly prohibited and cannot be discussed as part of any negotiation. It is why the Clippers were fined $250,000 by the NBA for supposedly mentioning the possibility of a car endorsement deal amid their free-agent negotiations with DeAndre Jordan. There is a reason that you don't see every Clipper endorsing Microsoft. The NBA policy is of zero tolerance.\nQ: Hi, Ira. I always get confused when it comes to the cap. Is an NBA team's salary cap and related \"tax\" or \"repeater tax\" calculated on the roster at the beginning of the season, or at the end? If it's at the end, what is considered the end? End of regular season, or end of playoffs? -- Eric, Miami.\nA: The tax is calculated at the end of the regular season. But since you can't do much to alter it after the trading deadline, it's basically the trading deadline. The \"cap\" must be adhered to at all times, around the calendar, although there are ample exceptions unless you become hard-capped, which the Heat are not. So, yes, the Heat certainly have ample time to get their tax books in order should they choose.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5411aadf/turbine/sfl-ask-ira-form"], "published": "2015-10-08T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:27:55.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
