The Serbian had the edge against the Russian as Ivanovic won 10 of 13 previous meetings. \nWe pick things up in the seventh game, and Ivanovic at the top of your screen and down a break. The two wage in a pretty good baseline rally. Kuznetsova tries to change the pace, but the Serb is too quick and retrieves that before smashing home a winner.That seemed to spur the former world number one who would win five of the next six games, and would take the frame, getting a little lucky on set point, as a net cord threw her opponent's rhythm off.The Russian would grab the second set to force a decider, but in the final frame, it would be all Ivanovic, as the heavy forehand winner gives her the match as she advances to the quarter-finals. \nWimbledon finalist Garbine Muguruza was celebrating her 22nd birthday -- and she did so by beating Mirjana Lucic-Baroni in three sets. The Serbian hitting wide on match point to give her opponent a 1-6, 6-2, 6-1. The victory als earns Muguraza a spot in the WTA Tour finals in Singapore later this month.
