No. 3 Ole Miss plays at No. 25 Florida and No. 13 Alabama plays at No. 8 Georgia, in addition to No. 21 Mississippi State playing at No. 14 Texas A&M.\nHere are our SEC rankings:\n1. Ole Miss (4-0, 2-0 SEC): Ole Miss vs. Florida wasn’t considered a high-profile game at the beginning of the season, but Florida has opened with four straight wins under new coach Jim McElwain and moved into the Top 25. Las Vegas oddsmakers give Ole Miss a 12-to-1 chance to win the national title. A loss to Florida and those odds may change dramatically.\n2. Georgia (4-0, 2-0): The Bulldogs are a slight favorite to win Saturday’s game against Alabama. How significant is that? If they remain the favorites, it will snap a 72-game streak in which Alabama has been favored, or only the longest such streak in modern college football history.\n3. LSU (3-0, 2-0): Not sure how long Les Miles will allow Leonard Fournette to play against Eastern Michigan. Consider these numbers: Fournette has gained 472 yards the past two games (not including 87 yards and a touchdown wiped out last week by a false start penalty). He is averaging 210.3 yards rushing per game. Eastern Michigan ranks 128th nationally in rush defense. Fournette may top 200 yards by the end of the first quarter.\n4. Alabama (3-1, 0-1): Don’t count the Crimson Tide out despite its league loss to Ole Miss. Alabama travels to Sanford Stadium for the first time since 2008, or about the last time it wasn’t favored to win. Freshman running back Bo Scarbrough is scheduled to make his debut for the Crimson Tide. As always, expect the new Alabama running back to be a contributor from the outset.\n5 Texas A&M (4-0, 1-0): The Aggies struggled to get past pesky Arkansas last week. The Razorbacks' plodding offense allowed it to play keepaway from A&M, which was averaging roughly 80 players per game. A&M ran only 16 in the first half against the Hogs. Normalcy will return when Mississippi State visits with more of an uptempo style.\n6. Mississippi State (3-1, 1-1): A&M coach Kevin Sumlin says the Bulldogs aren’t getting the respect they deserve and, hey, it’s not just coachspeak. He may be right. Their only loss is to LSU, the nation’s ninth-ranked team, by two points. And last week they held Auburn to three field goals.\n7. Florida (4-0, 2-0): Nice hire by Florida. Coach Jim McElwain has the buzz (chomp?) back in The Swamp. Last week’s win over Tennessee moved the Gators back into the Top 25. A win over Ole Miss this weekend moves the Gators back into the national conversation.\n8. Kentucky (3-1, 2-1): If McElwain is a first-half choice for SEC Coach of the Year honors, Kentucky’s Mark Stoops can’t be far behind. The Wildcats are becoming a football school (yes, they’ve heard that before). Beating Missouri last weekend was a start in that direction, or, at the least, an opportunity to delay John Calipari's domination of the sports coverage in Lexington.\n9. Missouri (3-1, 0-1): The Tigers have suspended quarterback Maty Mauk, after 18 straight starts, for Saturday’s game against South Carolina for a violation of team rules. Not sure if that’s a bad thing for the Tigers. Mauk has struggled, completing only 51.8 percent of his passes with six touchdowns and four picks.\n10. Tennessee (2-2, 0-1): So what happens if Tennessee has a double-digit lead against Arkansas early in the fourth quarter? It’s something the Vols will have to overcome after losing last weekend for the second time this season with a double-digit lead in the final 15 minutes.\n11. Auburn (2-2, 0-2): Redshirt freshman Sean White will get his second straight start at quarterback as Jeremy Johnson plays the backup role. After back-to-back SEC losses (to LSU and Mississippi State), the Tigers get a chance to correct some offensive shortcomings against San Jose State. But don’t look for former Memphis prep standout Jovon Robinson to be much of a factor. He’s buried on the depth chart at tailback.\n12. Arkansas (1-3, 0-1): Arkansas has dropped consecutive games to Toledo, Texas Tech and Texas A&M and faces Tennessee, which is struggling in its own regard. And, like Tennessee, the Razorbacks were unable to hold onto a fourth quarter lead last weekend.\n13. South Carolina (2-2, 0-2): Steve Spurrier, the Head Ball Coach, takes his team from Columbia, South Carolina, to Columbia, Missouri, to compete for the Columbia Cup. (Yes, that’s what they’ll play for.) Spurrier also will hope freshman QB Lorenzo Nunez can produce numbers (184 passing, 123 rushing) like he did in last week’s debut against Central Florida.\n14. Vanderbilt (1-3, 0-2): This will be the Commodores' first trip to Murfreesboro since 1920. Maybe the change of venue vs. Middle Tennessee will help Vanderbilt. The Commodores have lost the last three games (2001, 2002 and 2005) played in the series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:30:18.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
