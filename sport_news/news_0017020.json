The Rockets (6-0, 2-0 Mid-American Conference) led 28-6 at halftime, and then Ely really warmed up. He threw touchdown passes on Toledo's first two possessions of the second half, connecting with Corey Jones for a 55-yard score and then with Cody Thompson on an 88-yarder four minutes later. The touchdown to Thompson was the fourth longest completion in school history, and it wasn't the only record book-worthy play of the game against an Eastern Michigan (1-6, 0-3) defense that entered the game ranked 118th in scoring defense (40.7 points) and 116th in total defense (495.3 yards). ___ AP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:55:30.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
