The government had submitted proposals for the construction of 121 new roads at an estimated cost of Rs 810 crore but the Central Government put a rider asking the government to first complete the projects pending since 2011-12. Significantly, the Department of Rural Development is yet to present reports on the work carried out on 150 roads for which around Rs 1,150 crore was sanctioned. Meanwhile, Minister for Rural Development Pritam Singh Panwar has charged the BJP government at the Centre with working in a biased manner and deliberately targeting Congress-ruled states. “The construction of roads is such a work that cannot be completed in a time frame. There are very few roads on which the work could not be done due to technical reasons. The Central Government should have approved for the projects for this fiscal,” said Panwar. While politics behind the rejection cannot be ruled out, there is a growing concern among the Congress MLAs about the delay in sanctions as most of the proposals for this fiscal involve projects in the Congress held constituencies. Any delay in the projects could result in an irrevocable damage to the prospects of the MLAs getting elected again, in case the projects do not get a go-ahead. On the other hand, most of the detailed project reports regarding 150 roads were sanctioned when the UPA government was in power at the Centre. Clearly, in the battle for one-upmanship, the loser would be the state and its people who will have to wait longer for the construction of rural roads that would link them with the nearest connecting road head.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:11:53.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
