The skeletons had been tethered to lawn chairs and dressed in silly clothing, sitting on the river bottom.\nSholl says he pulled the pair from the river on Friday, placing them instead in his yard in Parker.\nSholl says he was upset when the story of the skeletons went all over the media with no mention of him, instead focusing on a La Paz County sheriff’s official.\nHe says he will return the skeletons after Halloween.\n___\nInformation from: Today’s News-Herald, http://www.havasunews.com", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1KAJz0A)"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:57:55.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
