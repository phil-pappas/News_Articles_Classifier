Faletto was named WAC Offensive Player of the Week. Advertisement Posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 12:57 pm HBU men's soccer downs No. 23 Utah Valley to complete historic weekend From our community   \nAfter spotting No. 23 Utah Valley a 1-0 lead, HBU men’s soccer scored two unanswered to defeat the Wolverines, 2-1, Sunday afternoon at Sorrels Field for the Huskies’ second-straight win over a ranked opponent. “After Friday’s game, it was a great win, the country sees that as a massive upset, but what we have to do is know that we are that good and these are things we are capable of doing,” said HBU head coach Steve Jones. “The difference in these two games is a commitment for 90 minutes of defending. The boys did a good job of that this weekend and we got results.” Dominick Faletto scored his second goal of the weekend and registered his fifth point in the two games as he and Alex Baez scored this afternoon for HBU (6-6-0 overall, 2-2-0 WAC). Darrell Johnson and Marc-Anthone had assists on the day. Faletto, Johnson, and Marcelo Acuna had a team-high three shots apiece. Chance Pope improved to 5-1-0 on the season as he stopped one shot. Aaron Meyer scored for UVU (10-3-0 overall, 3-1-0 WAC), as the Wolverines’ four match win streak was snapped. Skyler Milne and Austin Buxton registered three shots apiece. Derek Wilcox was busy in goal, as he made six saves. UVU came inches close of scoring in the 27th minute, as Meyer took a Wolverine corner kick. Giovanny Vazquez’s header attempt was stopped by Erick Aragon as he made a team save. The Wolverines got on the board 10 minutes later as Meyer scored off a rebound, as the initial shot was blocked by the Huskies’ defense. It took just three minutes for HBU to respond, as Johnson sent an up-field pass, Faletto beat the lone defender and scored past Wilcox to knot the match at 1-all and both teams entered halftime even. HBU outshot the Wolverines, 7-6, in the opening half and held a 3-2 advantage in corner kicks. Baez, getting the nod to start the second half, gave HBU the lead for good in the 52nd minute, assisted by Anthone. Anthone took a shot inside the box, Wilcox gave up a big rebound that went right to Baez, who scored past the diving keeper for a 2-1 host lead. UVU’s best chance for the equalizer came in in 78th minute, as Pope made a diving stop on Buxton’s shot inside the six-yard box. The rebound went to Milne, but the attempt sailed high. HBU outshot UVU, 7-5, in the second half and 14-11 in the match. The Wolverines had both corners in the second half for a 4-3 advantage in the match. HBU will look to keep the momentum going when it hosts UMKC Friday, Oct. 16 at 7:00 p.m. at Sorrels Field. The Huskies hit the road Sunday, Oct. 18 at Air Force for a 2:00 p.m. central time first kick. FALETTO VOTED WAC PLAYER OF THE WEEK DENVER, Colo. – HBU freshman forward Dominick Faletto has been named Western Athletic Conference Offensive Player of the Week, the league announced Monday. Faletto, who hails from Forney, Texas, scored his first collegiate goal and posted his first 3-point game in HBU's upset win over No. 19 Seattle, 3-1, Friday, then followed that with a goal in Sunday's 2-1 victory over No. 23 Utah Valley. He assisted on Friday's game winner and scored a breakaway goal that sealed the win for the Huskies. His goal Sunday evened the match at 1-1 three minutes after UVU scored. Friday's win was the first over a Top-20 team and the first over a ranked opponent since 2009. Faletto and the Huskies play a home-and-home this weekend, hosting UMKC Friday, Oct. 16 at 7:00 p.m. at Sorrels Field before heading to the airport to play Air Force in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Oct. 18 at 2:00 p.m. central time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:23:20.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
