It simply makes them. \n“They have a defensive front that’s comparable only to the NFL,” Bielema told reporters in Fayetteville on Monday. “At one point someone told me they’ve played 12 defensive interior defensive lineman. They all look the same. I swear there’s a little machine that just creates them, and they all walk outside. They all look the same, and they play the same unfortunately.” \nTo Bielema’s point, the Crimson Tide have eight or nine defensive linemen that they regularly rotate depending on the situation. Alabama has guys who are run stuffers (Darren Lake, Daron Payne, Josh Frazier), pass rushing specialists (D.J. Pettway, Dalvin Tomlinson, Jonathan Allen) and players who do both (A’Shawn Robinson and Jarran Reed). \nArkansas will get its shot at trying to run on the Tide’s defensive front on Saturday in Bryant-Denny Stadium at 6 p.m. \n“It really doesn’t affect us,” Allen said of the praise. “We don’t have time for things like that. (Defensive line) Coach Bo (Davis) does a good job of keeping us humble. We really don’t worry about what people say about us. We let our play do the talking.” \nThe play has done quite a bit of talking through five games of the season. Alabama’s front is holding team to 84 rushing yards, which is good for No. 1 in the SEC and 10th best in the nation. The Tide are holding teams to 2.75 yards per carry, also No. 1 in the SEC. \n“They’re extremely great guys on and off the field,” Tide linebacker Shaun Hamilton said. “They take that role, take on blockers and strike blockers up front. Those guys come in every week working hard. So it’s not just Saturday when they put in that work on the field.” \nWhile it’s certainly a group effort from that unit, two guys who stood out in the Tide’s last win over Georgia were Reed and true freshman Payne. \nLast week against Georgia, Reed shedded an offensive lineman with one hand, and tackle Georgia running back Nick Chubb. Reed is second on the team with 28 total tackles. He also has two tackles for loss and a sack. \n“He’s having a really good year,” Saban said. “His production is up, his production points are up. He’s shown a lot of leadership on the team this year. It’s been very important to him. He’s probably in better shape than he’s been in the past, and I think his quickness is better and I think that’s what’s been helpful to him being productive.” \nDue to the role he plays, Payne won’t shock anyone with his stats (three total tackles). But in watching the contest versus Georgia, the Bulldogs front struggled to move Payne. The true freshman consistently occupied two blockers and didn’t allow the Bulldogs to break anything through the middle during his time on the field. \n“Oh, man. He’s made quite an impression,” Allen said. “Very mature for his age. Great understanding of the playbook. Physical specimen. He’s done a good job adapting to our program, and he’s sitting there quite nicely.” \n(8) ALABAMA VS.
