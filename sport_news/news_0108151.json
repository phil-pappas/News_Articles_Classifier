(Mark M. Murray / The Republican File) Comments \nWhen the Springfield Public Schools Sports Hall of Fame committee decided to honor teams as well as individuals, the big question was, how to go about it? \nSoon, it became apparent that Technical High School - a city fixture from 1906 to 1986 - would be a good place to start. (Tech and Classical closed in 1987, replaced by Central High School). \n\"We agreed that it would be best to begin with teams that had achieved historic 'firsts' in high school sports,\" chairman Mike Martin said. \"Once we established that, it became clear that Tech would play a large role, because that school was a major power in a lot of sports over a long period.\" \nOf course, the other city power during the Tech years was its arch-rival, Cathedral, which is a parochial school and not part of the Springfield public schools system. Cathedral has its own Hall of Fame, established in 1988. \nAthletes nominated for the Public Schools Hall of Fame must be out of high school for 10 years. The same time span restriction applies to teams. \nAfter several meetings to assess nominations for its Class of 2015, the committee found that Tech teams in five sports produced \"firsts\" in city public-schools history, as follows: \n- Tech's 1937 football team went 6-0-1, thus becoming the first city public school to win a Western Mass. grid championship, under the ratings system then in place. Quarterback Cy Morgan, halfback Leo Christie, end Ray Carr and guard Ray Varanka made The Sunday Republican's all-Western Mass. honor roll. The Tigers, coached by Chief Walmer, scored 100 points, allowed 17. \n- Tech's golf teams of 1953-55 became the first to win three straight Western Mass. championships, and topped that with another first - the state title in 1955. Tech's Harry Mattson Jr. was WM medalist in 1953. Ronnie Mattson, his brother and teammate, won WMass the next two years, and added the state individual title in 1955. Tech's '53 team was coached by Henry Batt. Al Johnson coached the other two. \n- Tech's 1957 team surprised tournament favorite Pittsfield 3-0 to become the city's first public school Western Mass. baseball champion. Ken Rainey and Dave Wall combined for the shutout and gave veteran coach Johnny Kalloch his only regional baseball title. \n- Tech's 1965 hockey team finished second to Chicopee in the regular season, but came on strong at tournament time, giving the city its first public school Western Mass. champ on ice. Goaltender Chris Robbins and forward Paul Letourneau made The Sunday Republican's all-Western Mass. first team. Ed Mason, better known as a football coach, did a masterful job of motivating his skaters at tourney time. \n- In baseball, Tech scored another city first when its baseball teams of 1968-70 won three straight WM and state championships. Over the three seasons, the Tigers of coach Howie Burns went 55-5 and had a 41-game winning streak, still the WMass baseball record. Pitcher/catcher John Bedard, utilityman Howie Reed and outfielder Charlie Manley played on all three teams. \n- In wrestling, Tech's 1977 team became the first from Springfield to win the New England championship. Tony Perry at 119 pounds, Jim Gauthier at 157 and Evans Brantley in the heavyweight class won individual titles to spark the Tigers. Tech's Fred Scyocurka was named New England coach of the year. \nThe Public Schools Sports Hall of Fame will have its induction banquet Nov. 21 at Central High School. A total of 35 individuals and 10 teams will form the Class of 2015.
