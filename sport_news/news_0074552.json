Our focus has been much stronger in the Premier League than the Champions League, but we know in this game our focus needs to be the same. \n“We have belief and confidence we are doing something right. We could be a little bit suspected of not taking the first two games at the right level, of not taking opponents seriously enough.” \nWenger told uefa.com that the Gunners’ knowledge of great Bayern sides in the past will be crucial in the game. \n“We have played great Bayern teams before, certainly as good as the team we will play tomorrow (Tuesday), and beaten them. The side that did the treble [in 2012/13], for example. We have had good results against them,” Wenger stressed. \nBayern Munich coach Josep Guardiola however decided to thread cautiously in his assessment of the game. \n“Tomorrow we don’t play six points against zero. We play at 7.45 (UK time) at 0-0 with 90 minutes to go. \n“When I analyse a team I never look at the standings, I don’t care about that. I have to analyse them as if they had six points. \n“We know each other; Wenger and I. I faced his side with Barça and Bayern. They have great technical qualities and are very difficult to play against,” Guardiola admitted to uefa.com. \n“In this situation they have an advantage because they have to win. I cannot imagine they won’t fight for 90 minutes. You have to look for a way to play that situation, we have to be intelligent and control our game. \n“I prefer our situation, though, no doubt about that; I prefer to come here with six points rather than none. \n“But I can imagine my team with zero points at home to Arsenal – I know my team would be animals and aggressive, because it is the last chance. You have to give everything.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:12:24.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
