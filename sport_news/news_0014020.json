MORGAN Associated Press   24, 2015 - 11:59 pmLast Updated: October 24, 2015 - 11:59 pm   \nPeople: Photo Gallery: \nClick to view (8 Photos) \nSTARKVILLE, Mississippi — Dak Prescott accounted for six touchdowns to lead Mississippi State to a 42-16 victory over Kentucky on Saturday night. \nPrescott looked like last season's Heisman Trophy-contender, passing for 348 yards and three scores while rushing for 117 yards and three more, all season highs. \nPrescott threw 288 consecutive passes, dating to last season's Orange Bowl, without an interception before being picked off in the second quarter. \nMississippi State (6-2, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) had 586 yards of total offense, a season-high in conference play, and forced three turnovers on defense. \nKentucky (4-3, 2-3) finished 423 total yards, but struggled once it moved into Mississippi State territory. \nTaveze Calhoun had two interceptions, and Brandon Holloway, De'Runnya Wilson and Darrion Hutcherson each taught a touchdown pass for Mississippi State. \nKentucky's Patrick Towles completed 23 of 42 passes for 218 yards with two interceptions and one rushing touchdown. \nKentucky struck first with a 2-yard rushing touchdown by Towles. The Bulldogs responded as Prescott scored from a yard out. \nThe Wildcats tacked on a field goal and led 10-7 at the end of the first quarter, but then Prescott hit Wilson for a 13-yard touchdown early in the second. \nThe night reached its atmospheric peak late in the first half. With 3:05 left, Kentucky's Austin MacGinnis missed a 48-yard field goal attempt, and Mississippi State quickly capitalized. Prescott engineered a 5-play, 69-yard drive in 1:27 and hit Brandon Holloway for an 8-yard touchdown. Four plays later Taveze Calhoun intercepted Towles, and after a short drive Prescott ran 20 yards for another touchdown. \nMacGinnis made a 48-yard field goal just before the break and MSU led 28-13 at halftime. \nThe momentum never shifted back. \nIn the second half, Kentucky squandered a first-and-goal with a series of penalties and had to settle for 32-yard field goal. The Bulldog offense responded immediately, and Prescott hit Darrion Hutcherson for a 13-yard touchdown. \nPrescott rushed for another touchdown in the fourth quarter. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:27:39.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
