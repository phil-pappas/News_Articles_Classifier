He's leaving, of course, because the scorched-earth evangelicals and Tea Party wack jobs believe that he wasn't tough enough in toeing their line. It's likely that his successor will be even further to the right. I've often loved it when the GOP selected fringe idiots, because it made blowback likely, swinging the pendulum back to some semblance of reality. However, all too often the pendulum swings back only after serious and lingering damage is done â€” as in the Ronald Reagan and Shrub (George W. Bush) administrations.\nMy hope is that the fight for a new speaker drags on for many months (as it has on several occasions in our history) and further exposes the ugly underbelly of the most divisive, racist and destructive version of a political party that we've seen in at least 50 years.\nMichael D.
