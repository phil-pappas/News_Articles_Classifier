The remarks from TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger came Monday during a Sioux Falls forum. The agency has come under scrutiny after the Department of Homeland Security found that undercover agents carrying mock explosives, weapons and other prohibited items made it through airport checkpoints in 67 of 70 instances. Neffenger was confirmed as administrator in June, shortly after the reports surfaced. He calls the failure rate disturbing. Neffenger wants front-line screeners doing what they're supposed to do, which is ensuring that banned items don't get past checkpoints. He says leaders can worry about things like queuing and line speed. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
