Sitting around a conference table this summer, top officials for Bayer Leverkusen initially used Javier Hernández’s name as a placeholder, a symbol for the kind of forward they were hoping to add during the transfer period.\nHernández, a Mexican star known as Chicharito, or Little Pea, is a small, quick, savvy striker who excels at artfully reading the spaces between defenders and fiercely poaching goals when opportunities are presented. A player like that would be perfect, all the Bayer executives agreed, as a complement to Stefan Kiessling, the 6-foot-3 German who has led the club’s attack for nine years.\nBut signing Hernández himself seemed unattainable. He was under contract to Manchester United and playing on loan at Real Madrid. “Everyone laughed,” Jonas Boldt, the club’s sporting manager, said, “because it was a fantasy. But then we thought, well, maybe we should reach out and try. Maybe it could work?”\nIt did. At the end of a last-minute sequence of events that Hernández called “unexpected” and Boldt labeled “a dream,” Hernández left the Premier League for the Bundesliga on Aug. 31. After a month of trying to expand his German vocabulary beyond “danke,” he has arrived in California this week for Saturday’s Concacaf playoff match between Mexico and the United States feeling, as he put it, “a kind of confidence I haven’t felt in a very long time.”\nPhoto Hernández, right, playing for Mexico in an exhibition against Argentina last month in Arlington, Tex. Credit Jerome Miron/USA Today Sports, via Reuters This is not ideal for the United States. Jurgen Klinsmann, the American coach, has billed Saturday’s match at the Rose Bowl, which will settle which team will represent the region at the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia, as a major showdown. U.S. Soccer’s news releases have labeled the game “epic.”\nHernández figures to be the focal point of Mexico’s attack. While it is unclear who will partner with him at the top of Mexico’s formation — Giovani dos Santos was ruled out this week with a muscle strain — Hernández has been a favorite of Mexico’s interim coach, Ricardo Ferretti. If the United States hopes to win, containing Hernández will be a priority.\nAdvertisement\n That figures to be more difficult now, though, as Hernández’s self-belief is peaking.\n“My weakness has definitely been my confidence,” he said last week in an interview at Bayer Leverkusen. “It has been very difficult for me. There were so many times in the last years when I didn’t get chances, didn’t get chances, didn’t get chances, and sometimes I didn’t understand why. It hurt me. But now I feel like I am in a place where it will be different.”\nHernández became the first Mexican to play for Manchester United when he joined the club in 2010 — a source of pride for him — but he has endured an up-and-down career in Europe. He won two Premier League titles with United (scoring 20 goals in his first season) only to fall out of favor in 2013, when Alex Ferguson stepped down as the manager.\nIn 2014, Hernández went on loan to Real Madrid, which won the Champions League that season, but he was again in and (mostly) out of the lineup. He first heard from Bayer Leverkusen, among many other clubs, about a possible transfer late last spring. Hernández was interested, but Manchester United was not.\nPhoto Hernández, right, at a training session in Mexico City this week.

Boldt texted with Hernández often as Hernández endured a frustrating few months: Logistical problems kept him from playing in the Copa América in Chile, and he missed Mexico’s Concacaf Gold Cup triumph after fracturing his collarbone in an exhibition just before the tournament.\nUnited Coach Louis Van Gaal began the preseason intending to use Hernández in a substitute role similar to one he had played in recent years — news that depressed Boldt and Leverkusen — but a few days before the transfer deadline, everything changed.\nOn Aug. 26, Hernández badly missed a penalty kick in Manchester United’s victory over Club Brugge; television cameras caught Van Gaal looking incredulously at an assistant coach after the attempt, which went wide right after Hernández appeared to slip as he made contact with the ball.\nDays later, Hernández said, he had a meeting with Van Gaal in which the coach informed him that he would be a backup player for the team during the coming season and that he was free to pursue a transfer. Then, on Aug. 30, Manchester United acquired the teenage striker Anthony Marital, effectively pushing Hernández even further down Van Gaal’s pecking order.\nBayer Leverkusen, which had stayed in touch with Hernandez and his agent throughout the summer, and had just pocketed 22 million pounds (roughly $33.5 million) by selling the rights to the South Korean forward Son Heung-min to Tottenham, sensed an opportunity. On Aug. 31, after hurried negotiations, Hernández arrived in Germany for a physical exam and the completion of his move.\n“All of it — the missed penalty, the look on the manager’s face, our sale of Son to free up some money — all of it needed to happen just that way for this to work,” Boldt said. “That’s football sometimes. It’s crazy.”\n Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nHernández laughed. “This club, it’s hungry — it is a club people know, but it wants to be bigger; it wants to prove more,” he said. “Like me.”\nSettling in will take some time. Hernández is searching for a house in Cologne or Düsseldorf, cities that are nearby. He is adapting to the pace of a new league. And he has a translator whispering in his ear in the locker room while Coach Roger Schmidt talks tactics in German.\nAll of it is an adventure for Hernández, who said he hoped that his quick comfort in his new home would carry over to his international play. While the American midfielder Michael Bradley used the word “hate” in an Instagram post last week about the United States-Mexico rivalry, Hernández said that emotion was too strong for him. Still, he acknowledged that games like Saturday’s came with a different emotional level.\nHe expects the crowd at the Rose Bowl to favor Mexico. While American fans are vociferous, he said, nothing quite compares to Mexicans who are living in the United States.\n“For the most part, I think, the Mexicans in America have had hard lives, have pushed so hard to reach America that when they have a chance to celebrate the Mexican national team, it is like for a day, they are back in their country,” he said. “For Americans, they are growing up as soccer fans. Soccer is still kind of a new sport for them. There are so many other sports, too, and it’s improving. But to Mexicans, it’s all there is. Soccer is everything.”\nThat devotion, Hernández said, is part of what motivates him to seize the opportunity he has been given at Leverkusen. He did not want to come back to North America to play in M.L.S., or the Mexican league where he began his career. He did not want to give up on his dream yet.\nDespite the uncertainty of the past few years, Hernández, 27, believes he can be a top player in Europe. He believes he can thrive. And in Germany, he believes he has finally found the place where it can happen.\nLoading... Go to Home Page »\nSite Index The New York Times News World U.S. Politics N.Y.
