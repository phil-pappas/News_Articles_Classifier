Think Adam Goodes as an anti-racism ambassador for the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Sydney Swans and GWS Giants playing for the White Ribbon Trophy to denounce violence against women, and former Australian paceman Glenn McGrath starting the McGrath Foundation to support breast cancer sufferers and nurses.\nNow, Pittsburgh Steelers player DeAngelo Williams wants to promote a worthwhile cause, but the NFL allegedly won’t let him. Williams lost his mother to breast cancer in 2014, and in honour of her death, dyed his hair pink. He even painted his finger nails and toenails pink.\nWilliams knows there are more important things in life than football. Source: Getty Images\nWith October being breast cancer awareness month, the NFL is allowing players to wear an item of pink clothing in every match throughout the month. The Steelers running back wanted to take this opportunity a step further and wear pink for the rest of the season, but that’s not going to happen.\nDuring ESPN’s broadcast of the Steelers’ match against the San Diego Chargers on Monday Night Football , presenter Lisa Salters said the NFL refused Williams’ proposition because it would constitute a uniform violation.\nESPN anchor Field Yates supported this claim.\nSteelers RB DeAngelo Williams wanted to wear pink all season to honor his mother who lost her battle with breast cancer. The NFL said no.\n— Field Yates (@FieldYates) October 13, 2015 Williams’ pink dreads became such a part of his identity that they even featured in popular NFL video game Madden 16 .\nIn May last year, the now 32-year-old penned an emotional tribute to his mum for sports website MMQB, titled “Wear Pink For My Mom, Who Lived to Love” .\nIn that story, Williams illustrated just how significant the seemingly simple act of wearing pink can be.\n“One time, a lady came up to me and said she was going to get examined just because she saw me wearing pink cleats during a game. I walked away thinking, ‘Wow, pink is really so much more than just a colour.’ It’s a lifesaver. It’s awareness. If we reach one, we reach millions. If we reach millions, we’re doing our job and getting closer to finding a cure,” he wrote.\n“That’s why I am so passionate about raising awareness, because I have seen first-hand how it can impact others.”\nThis season is dedicated to u Mom. Love u and miss u. #PinkPanther pic.twitter.com/TlEw8061cG\n— DeAngelo Williams (@DeAngeloRB) September 7, 2014 Suffering the trauma of losing a parent can cripple even the strongest of people, but Williams used it as inspiration to better the world. In his article he went on to challenge people to take even the smallest steps to fight the debilitating disease.\n“I want to ask one small favour of each of you...well, two actually,” wrote Williams.\n“First, wear a pink shirt at least once a month, and make it a point to tell people that you’re doing so to help remind everyone that breast cancer awareness is 365 days a year.\n“Second...please call, text, email, tweet or Facebook five women you care about (in honour of my mom and her four sisters) and ask them if they’ve gotten a mammogram lately.”\nSo committed is Williams to helping those with breast cancer that he set up the DeAngelo Williams Foundation, which provides free mammograms to women in several US cities such as Memphis and Arkansas.\nSo while the NFL won’t help him pay tribute to his mother and support the battle against breast cancer to the extent he would want, it’s impossible to see Williams giving up the fight anytime soon.\nJump back to top\nsport breaking news 18:13 PM Live: Victoria closes on second spot 21:14 PM Heartache Hilton: Bulls down dogged CA XI 20:00 PM Giants unapologetic over Treloar, McCarthy 14:28 PM Fanning ‘upset’ by KFC’s shark attack ad 11:07 AM Proteas keeper equals Sachin Tendulkar", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F13%2FFSD_131015_NFL_STEELERS_CHARGERS_GRABS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PinkPanther?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/DeAngeloRB/status/508711880312233984", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5dc23930d85c90ee8a7726246847a6b7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "https://twitter.com/FieldYates/status/653735404005421057", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://t.co/TlEw8061cG", "http://mmqb.si.com/2014/05/29/nfl-carolina-panthers-deangelo-williams-sandra-kay-hill-breast-cancer-awareness", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2cd3a5dbc968b4fd810f1b52aab0816b"], "published": "2015-10-14T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:48:23.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
