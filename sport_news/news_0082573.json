(AP) -- California Chrome, last year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, could return to racing early next year at Santa Anita.\nTrainer Art Sherman says last year's Horse of the Year might run in the San Pasqual Stakes on Jan. 9.\nThe 4-year-old colt returned to Sherman's barn at Los Alamitos in Orange County last week. California Chrome had been recovering the last few months from a bone bruise injury at a farm in Kentucky.\nSherman says, ''He's a big, strong horse and we've got a long way to go.''\nCalifornia Chrome's Triple Crown bid was derailed with a fourth-place finish in the Belmont. He was set to run in the Arlington Million in August near Chicago, but those plans were canceled when his injury was found.\nSports & Recreation Horse Racing California Chrome Kentucky Derby Art Sherman   195/73864   154/1704   266/4545  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:09:52.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
