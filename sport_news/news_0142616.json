(We were) going up to each other high-fiving each other saying, ‘Today is the day,’” said Grizzlies outside hitter Kelsey Bauer, who had a team-high 13 kills. “We’ve been waiting for this win for a really long time and that just shows how hard we’ve worked.” \nGolden Valley (6-8 overall, 1-1 in Foothill) had to work hard to earn its first conference victory in nearly four years, by taking three straight games after dropping the opener, 25-18. \nThe Grizzlies and Cowboys battled in Games 2 and 3 pushing the score to extra points. \nIn the second game, Canyon (5-4, 0-2) went up by as many as six points, but Golden Valley fought back with strong serving from Bauer and Emiley Grose, who each had an ace. \nThe Cowboys did help the Grizzlies out with five errors in the second half of Game 2, including a double hit to break a 24-all tie. \n“(Golden Valley) worked harder than us,” said Canyon head coach Brian Ingino. “We got nervous and we didn’t step up. We had 53 errors in the four games. It’s hard to win a game when you have that many.” \nAlthough the next two games were clashes of their own, the momentum was definitely on the Grizzlies’ side with the student section roaring. \n“To Canyon’s credit, they played really hard and came back a number of times,” said Golden Valley head coach Erick Beck. “But in the critical moments, our setters made good decisions with the ball and got the ball to our best hitters when they need to, and that can be the difference in the game sometimes.” \nHart 3, West Ranch 0 \nHart swept West Ranch by scores of 25-12, 25-13, 25-21 at West Ranch High Thursday night. \nThe Indians were led by Amy McKee, who tallied 10 kills. Sarah Coblentz added nine kills and three aces, while Brooke Boron knocked in four kills and racked up seven blocks. \nMadi Fay had 17 assists and Liz Baker had 17 digs for a Hart team that moves to 6-3 overall and 2-0 in conference. \nWith the loss West Ranch drops to an 8-7 overall and 0-2 in league. \nValencia 3, Saugus 1 \nValencia won in four games over Saugus on Wednesday night by scores of 25-17, 25-23, 17-25, 25-21. \nEmily Burns and Daniella Villano both had double-figure kills on the night with 15 and 10, respectively. \nHolly Pittman added nine kills, while Kelsey Knudsen had seven kills and 23 digs. \nThe Vikings improved to 6-0 overall and 2-0 in league play. Saugus drops to 10-8 and 1-1 in league with the loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:06:53.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
