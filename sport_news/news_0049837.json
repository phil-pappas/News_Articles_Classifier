A log cabin in the midst of the Cox, Princess Anne and Ocean Lakes skyscrapers through the years, the Marlins have 12 seniors with vast experience.\n\"They have phenomenal team chemistry,\" Ocean Lakes coach Heath Boomer said.\nMartin leads the crew with a jack-of-all-trades style. He can blast an attack but still tip it at the perfect time.\n\"He's one of those technicians,\" Keros said.\nHis prowess comes with only four years of volleyball experience. He picked it up as a freshman at a neighbor's recommendation. Martin has played soccer and basketball for Bayside but found a niche in volleyball. He replaced basketball with a club volleyball season.\nAn added bonus to trying out at Bayside: \"There were no cuts, so I wouldn't be embarrassed,\" Martin deadpanned.\nBayside players built a foundation last year as a tough out and recognized they'd be a decent team this year with so many returners. But not this good.\nBayside beat then-No. 1 Ocean Lakes last week to claim sole possession of first place in the Coastal Conference.\nThe difference this year, Martin and Keros agreed, is having a solid player at every position and a deep bench.\n\"To be honest this is the first time in my 12 years that I have a complete team,\" Keros said.\nDespite their meteoric rise, the Marlins haven't been caught flat-footed in big games. Their close friendship and trust has held firm. If any nerves creep in, teammates look to Martin.\n\"I'm real relaxed and chilled in everything I do,\" Martin said. \"When the team is worried, I'm never worried. If we're down 20, I'm still gonna play the same like we're up 30.\"\nThat's why Keros looked at his assistant coaches with wide eyes when Martin yelled last month. And also why Keros was shocked to find out Martin sustained an injury that day.\n\"After playing all day, tons of matches, he comes off the court excited,\" Keros said. \"I tell him to ice up and rest up. Later his dad called me and told me (Martin) kind of threw his arm out. He played through that.\"\nBayside hopes Martin has a few more tricks up his sleeve come postseason.\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image. Buy Pilot photos here.\nLoading...
