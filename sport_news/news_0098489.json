The Blue Jays were a game below .500 on the road (40–41), but had a +63 run differential on the road, which translates to a .576 Pythagorean winning percentage. Even more confusing are the Rangers’ home/road splits. Texas had a better record on the road but a better run differential at home, as it only outscored its opponents by one run on the road over the course of the entire season. However, the Rangers’ Pythagorean winning percentage based on their +17 run differential at home (.521) is still 10 points lower than their actual home winning percentage of .531. The upshot here is that the Rangers had success at home and on the road, and the Blue Jays are a better road team than their record implies.\nMLB Video Five-run second dooms Garcia, Cardinals as Cubs even NLDS by Michael Rosenberg", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/cliffcorcoran"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:41:39.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
