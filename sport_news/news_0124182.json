Autos were seen ferrying passengers at the Vaishali metro station, the terminal point of the metro line in Ghaziabad, on Monday. Autos also have been moving through Mohan Nagar, Link Road, GT Road and other parts of Ghaziabad.\nMembers of the Ghaziabad Three-Wheeler Auto Chalak Union, however, said the strike has not been called off.\nRegular movement of autos in the city on Monday has spared commuters from inconveniences that were faced a day earlier on roads.\nUnion president Dilshad Ahmed was not available for comments. The union has called the strike citing a slew of demands. Among other demands, the union has asked for the raising of life span of autos with 3+1 capacity from the current eight years to 15, and that of the Vikram autos with 6+1 capacity from seven years to 10. Union members said that the transport department is, at the same time, collecting one-time road taxes from both categories of vehicles for a period of ten years notwithstanding the life-spans.
