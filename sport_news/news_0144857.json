By Jack White October 14, 2015 Junior Jeremy Lynn started the 2015 season going 2-0 in doubles with senior Ruben Weber and 0-2 in singles at the Arizona Wildcat Invitational over two weeks ago. Now approaching his second tournament of the year — the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Regionals — Lynn will look to get his first singles victory. “He’s working on some new things in his game,” head coach Geoff Young said. “I don’t think he played his best tennis in [the Wildcat Invitational], but I think that ever since then, he’s been playing better.” Lynn joined the Gophers from Joplin, Mo., where he won the state championship in high school in 2013. “[In high school] I thought he had a really good forehand with a really good serve,” Young said. Lynn has seen playing time in all three of his collegiate seasons, finishing 3-11 in singles as a freshman but improving to 7-7 as a sophomore. Lynn went 2-3 in doubles as a freshman but only competed in one doubles match last year, which he lost. To start his junior season, Lynn was defeated 6-2, 6-1 by Jason Jaruvang of Arizona at the Wildcat Invitational. In the consolation round, he was defeated 6-4, 6-2 by Felix Schumann of Northern Arizona University. Now, Lynn is focused on making adjustments to pick up his first victory at the team’s next tournament. “I’m looking to become a more well-rounded player and be able to get into the net a little more, be more aggressive,” Lynn said. “So I’ve been working on my sway on my backhand. I think it can be an effective shot and throw people off.” Off the court, Lynn originally thought he would be a business major, but he is currently studying film and media. “I love to watch movies and [want to] eventually start making movies,” Lynn said. Lynn said he’s made a short video for one of his film classes and is looking forward to making a 10-minute spot by the end of the semester. “I don’t know what it’s about yet,” Lynn said. “I’ve just been enjoying the process of how to do it. I love movies, always have, and it’s cool to start doing it.” Young said he is optimistic Lynn will bounce back at the next tournament. “He’s been working on his slice backhand and coming to the net more,” Young said. “I’m really excited the rest of the fall, watching him play.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:17:04.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
