After making four birdies in a four-hole stretch, the Wyckoff native hooked his drive on 18 into the desert rocks and ended up saving bogey with a 10-foot putt. \n\"I was just saying if I could see the ball in there and it wasn’t in the bush, I’d give it a shot,\" said Hoffmann, 26. \"Yeah, lucky to get out of there with bogey.\" \nStegmaier rebounded for a bogey on the par-3 17th with a 13-foot birdie putt on the par-4 18th to reach 13-under 68. The former University of Florida player, 32, completed a second-round 66. \n\"It played a little tougher, so played a little more conservatively,\" Stegmaier said. \"Certainly happy to make four birdies and one bogey and be in the lead.\" \nJimmy Walker, former UNLV player Chad Campbell and 2011 winner Kevin Na were tied for third at 11-under. Walker had a 69, Na shot 68 and Campbell 70. \n\"I think that the pins are a lot more difficult than they normally are; a lot of tough pins,\" Walker said. \"It’s like they don’t want us to make birdies. A lot of holes, par is pretty good here.\" \nAlex Cejka had a hole-in-one on the 212-yard 17th in a 66 that left him at 10-under. Rickie Fowler was tied for 28th at 6-under after a 70. \nKo leads by four shots \nTAIPEI, Taiwan — Lydia Ko took a four-stroke lead in the LPGA Taiwan Championship, putting the 18-year-old New Zealander in position to regain the top spot in the world ranking. \nKo had four birdies in a five-hole stretch and closed with another birdie for a 5-under 67 in windy conditions at rain-soaked Miramar. \nSouth Korea’s Eun-Hee Ji, a stroke ahead after each of the first two rounds, was second after a 72. England’s Charley Hull was another shot back after a 71.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:06:25.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
