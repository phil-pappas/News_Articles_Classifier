Rodriguez was ejected in the seventh inning when the benches cleared and decided to take out his frustrations on an unsuspecting water cooler. Rodriguez worked several combinations on the cooler before it tumbled to the ground. The one-sided bout drew an avalanche of meme's and GIFs as well as a Piratescooler parody Twitter account that quickly gained over 8,000 followers. Rodriguez took to Twitter to apologize on Thursday \"for allowing my emotions to control my actions in a negative manner.\" Rodriguez added he \"spoke to the cooler, apologized personally, and he's forgiven me as Christ forgives all.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:54:14.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
