Armas, Associated Press 7:01 p.m. CDT October 17, 2015 Wisconsin linebacker Nick Thomas (45) runs for a touchdown against Purdue defensive end Antoine Miles (11) and cornerback Stefan Certa (26) during the first half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, in Madison.

Edwards then forced the Boilermakers’ Markell Jones to fumble at the Purdue 43. Safety Tanner McEvoy pounced on the ball to seal the win for the Badgers. \nEdwards, one of two freshmen starting at inside linebacker for Wisconsin, finished with 16 tackles. \nThe only score for Purdue (1-6, 0-3) came on David Blough’s 2-yard quarterback keeper in the second quarter. \nPurdue defensive tackle Ra'Zahn Howard (14) sacks Wisconsin quarterback Joel Stave (2) during the first half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, in Madison.

Purdue capitalized after Leroy Clark intercepted Stave at the 5 and returned the ball 66 yards. \nBlough’s score tied the game at 7. Just like two weeks ago in a 24-21 loss at Michigan State, the Boilermakers had designs of pulling off an unlikely upset on the road. \nIt took a while before Wisconsin could assert control. \nThe running game could only amass 96 yards against a Purdue defense that was giving up a Big Ten-worst 215 yards a game on the ground. \nBut the Badgers got production in the red zone from their tailbacks. \nPurdue safety Robert Gregory (7) and cornerback Frankie Williams (24) take down Wisconsin wide receiver Robert Wheelwright (15) during the first half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, in Madison.

He finished with 19 yards on nine carries. \nAside from his bad throw that led to the pick, Stave was solid and finished 30 of 39. The Badgers moved the ball through the air to set up their tailbacks. \nStave connected with seven different receivers, led by nine catches for 86 yards for Alex Erickson. \nFor Purdue, the effort to simplify the offense this week for redshirt freshman Blough produced few results. Blough was 15 of 26 for 136 yards, picking up chunks of yardage late in the fourth quarter with the game well in hand for Wisconsin. \nA 39-yard touchdown pass by Blough with 1:09 left was called back by a holding penalty. \nFollow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:17:47.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
