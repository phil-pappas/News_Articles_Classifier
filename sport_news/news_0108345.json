In its place, Bowen was given the chance to meet his favorite player.\n“He signed some stuff for me and thanked me for returning the ball,” Bowen said. “I got to congratulate an icon on this amazing accomplishment and what he’s done. It was great.”\nBowen said he and a few friends met Brady after practice. Brady posed for pictures with the group and signed a few items, including footballs, helmets and photos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:23:10.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
