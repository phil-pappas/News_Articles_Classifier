Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, has introduced legislation that would allow Wisconsin voters to register online. \nWhile the legislation comes at a time when Republicans are attempting to rewrite campaign finance regulations and transform the Government Accountability Board into two separate partisan-appointed commissions, it also comes with rare bipartisan support. The bill was initially cosponsored by Rep. Terese Berceau, D-Madison, and had the co-sponsorship of several other Democrats in the Legislature. \nHowever, LeMahieu said late Thursday that most Democratic sponsorship had dropped off the bill, due to concerns regarding other changes. The bill also includes language that would mandate that absentee ballots must be turned in by 8 p.m. on Election Day, rather than Friday after the election stated in current law. \nBerceau attempted to include the provision in an omnibus election regulations bill in mid-2013. While the compromise bill eventually passed out of committee, that measure eventually failed due to lack of support among Republicans in the legislature -- the compromise also included raising campaign finance donation limits and other tweaks that not all legislators agreed with. \nAnother problem was that it came in the middle of legal wrangling over Voter ID. LeMahieu said that while he wasn't around for that battle, it makes sense to move on the online voter registration piece now that voter ID is in place. \n\"The way we’re setting up with this bill, you have to have a state ID to register online,\" LeMahieu said. \"It essentially takes out the special registration deputies where there can be errors made, whereas now it's kicking it against the state’s database, its accurate, can keep it accurate and making it available for people to register from the comfort of their home.\" \nBased on the bill , the GAB would have to set up an online database and work out an agreement with the Department of Transportation that would allow election officials to check residence information with DOT data. It would also eliminate the special registration deputies altogether. \nThat last item is why the bill has drawn opposition from the Wisconsin League of Women Voters and some Democrats. In a call to action on Sunday, the league said it could not accept the elimination of those deputies, even for an idea that it supports. \n\"The League registers voters year-round through the SRD program, which makes a huge difference for elderly, minority and disabled voters, as well as new citizens,\" the message posted Sunday said. \"Other SRDs are librarians, teachers and other concerned citizens who wish to make voting accessible to all eligible citizens. These registrations reduce the workload of our municipal clerks, who have many other duties to carry out. \" \nLeMahieu said the request came at the urging of municipal clerks and that he would have to hear alternative suggestions before agreeing to amend the bill further. \nIn addition, while the bill says GAB would carry out that task of setting up the registration database, such language would need to be altered if LeMahieu's bill splitting GAB into two separate commissions were to pass. That bill, which also gets a hearing Tuesday, would create an elections commission and ethics commission with at least six appointees -- one each by the Senate majority and minority leaders, Assembly Speaker, Assembly minority leader and two others chosen by \"leadership\" of both houses and appointed by the governor. \nAnother bill, recreating the state's campaign finance regulations and doubling the contribution limits to campaigns , will also be heard Tuesday. Common Cause for Wisconsin, a left-learning campaign finance reform group, has urged its supporters to turn out in opposition to both the GAB and campaign finance bills, saying that both bills would remove most regulatory controls on Wisconsin's campaign finance system. \n\"The net effect of this plan is effectively the complete deregulation of campaign finance law in Wisconsin, including any meaningful transparency or disclosure,\" the group said in an email statement last week. \"Much more money, in much larger amounts will flow.\" \nLeMahieu, who has been involved in both bills, said the bill doubled campaign contribution limits in order to move more campaign activity into actual campaigns, where disclosure of donors and spending is required. Other parts of the bill would essentially lift most other contribution limits altogether and allow issue advocacy coordination with campaigns -- such as campaigns working with third-party groups who don't advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate. \nLeMahieu said they were just codifying court rulings that already said as such. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in July that campaign coordination with issue advocacy groups was legal and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling -- McCutcheon v. FEC -- lifted the aggregate limits that an individual could donate to a political parties, PACs or campaigns. But much of the rewrite was prompted by a lengthy court of appeals ruling that attributed many of the disputes over campaign finance in the state to the Legislature's inability to update its regulations with significant federal rulings. \nReach Jason Smathers at 920-453-5167 or jsmathers1@sheboyganpress.com. 2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://shebpr.es/1RD4eqI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:05:22.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
