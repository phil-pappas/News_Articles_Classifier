That’s all. There is no particular reason. There’s a few things that play in my favor.” \nZhang, 25, could only applaud after he was outclassed in all facets by the Serbian 10-time grand slam-winner, who has only ever dropped three sets at the China Open. \n“As for his level of play, his game, I think there’s no loopholes or shortcomings. Actually, I prepared very well in order to play my game. But he won three major titles (this year),” said Zhang. \n“His performance is amazing. He is really good.” \nEarlier, Ivo Karlovic bludgeoned his way into the record books for career aces, and Garbine Muguruza had an eventful 22nd birthday as she smashed a racquet, reached the WTA Finals and then celebrated with cake. \nMuguruza was frustrated by Croatia’s Mirjana Lucic-Baroni but she gathered herself for a 1-6, 6-2, 6-1 win which qualified her for the glitzy, eight-player season finale in Singapore. \n“I’m just really motivated, like I said before, to try to finish good. It’s great to be qualified. But tomorrow I have another match,” said the Spaniard, who was presented with a cake on court after the win. \nThe day’s most historic achievement came from Karlovic, who broke Croat compatriot Goran Ivanisevic’s record for career aces as he went down to Uruguay’s Pablo Cuevas. \nThe 2.11-meter Karlovic hammered 26 aces in his 6-7 (5), 6-7 (7) defeat, reaching a total of 10,247 and surpassing Ivanisevic’s 10,237 along the way. \nThe record was consolation for Karlovic after his loss to 37th-ranked Cuevas, who is enjoying a dream run in Beijing after he beat world No. 5 Tomas Berdych in the first round. \nLast month’s US Open finalists both also suffered upsets with New York winner Flavia Pennetta, who is set to retire at the end of the season, going out 6-3, 4-6, 3-6 to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia. \nPennetta’s defeat came after fellow Italian Roberta Vinci was beaten 1-6, 6-3, 2-6 by American Bethanie Mattek-Sands, in yet another surprise at the unpredictable Beijing tournament. \nIn the late match, sixth-seeded Ana Ivanovic of Serbia outlasted Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-5, 4-6, 6-2 to reach the quarterfinals. \nIn Tokyo, Marin Cilic overpowered Steve Johnson 6-3, 6-3 yesterday to advance to the quarterfinals of the Japan Open. \nThe sixth-seeded Croat saved all five break points he faced to set up a quarterfinal with second seed Kei Nishikori, who is bidding for his third Japan title. \nCilic, who is seeking his first title of the year and the 14th of his career, hit a powerful forehand to wrap up the match in 73 minutes. \nCilic beat Nishikori in the final of the 2014 US Open but the Japanese player won their last meeting in the semifinals of the Citi Open in August and owns a 6-3 record against the Croatian. \nIn other matches, qualifier Austin Krajicek beat Joao Sousa 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 and will next face top-seeded Stan Wawrinka. \nNick Kyrgios lost just eight points on his serve to sweep into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Roberto Bautista Agut. \nKyrgios will face France’s Benoit Paire in the next round. Paire beat Marcos Baghdatis 6-3, 2-6, 7-5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:50:46.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
