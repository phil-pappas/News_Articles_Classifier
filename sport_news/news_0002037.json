But before they could leave, she needed permission from the parents of the girls, ages 16 to 22.\nOne father — his daughter had been secretly training for the mission for months — was reticent. Gilbert and her team went to visit him.\n\"Basically what he said to us was, 'What I think you are doing is a waste of time and a waste of resources because she's a girl and she's not worth it,' \" Gilbert said. \"I left that meeting thinking 'Holy ... this is what these girls have to deal with.' \"\nThe man's daughter proved to be one of the strongest climbers on the August expedition deep into the mountainous Hindu Kush range, north of Kabul, in the Panjshir Valley. Gilbert told the father, who wouldn't look her in the eye at their first meeting, that his daughter was gifted, strong and a fast learner with lots of potential.\n\"You could see this little glimmer in his eye,\" Gilbert said. \"He shook my hand with both hands and thanked me with tears in his eyes. He was so impressed with the changes in his girl.\"\nWomen don't climb in Afghanistan.\nAdvertisement Under the intolerant grip of Islamic extremists, women rarely even leave their homes and are forbidden to attend school or hold jobs. The idea behind the expedition — led by Gilbert through Virginia-based nonprofit Ascend: Leadership Through Athletics — was to empower young women through climbing, instilling leadership skills they could sow throughout their country.\nA film crew from HBO and television news magazine Vice documented the expedition. During a wrap-up interview, one of the filmmakers asked Gilbert what she thought of the trip.\nShe started sobbing.\n\"As a climber, it was pretty easy,\" she said, \"but it meant so much.\"\n\"On top of our first summit, I had never seen women be so proud of what they had accomplished. These girls are growing up being told 'No, you can't do that. It's not a girl's place. Women don't do that,' \" Gilbert said. \"I realized I had grown up with everyone around me telling me I could do anything I wanted and encouraging me to do everything. It was kind of heartbreaking for me, the depth and level of trauma these girls have experienced personally but also as a culture. It was just heart-wrenching to see how little support there is for women who have been through so much.\"\nMarina LeGree had worked for nonprofits in Afghanistan for years before founding Ascend in 2014.\nShe briefly considered basketball as the vehicle to empower the war-ravaged nation's young women but quickly opted for mountaineering. LeGree said prolonged trips into the mountains can become \"a container\" separate from the girls' stress-filled lives, where they attend underground schools and live in perpetual oppression. The teamwork, isolation from populated areas and bond-building elements convinced LeGree that mountain climbing was the way to go.\nBut she wasn't a climber.\nSo she recruited Gilbert — and fellow guide Emilie Drinkwater — to lead the mission. But this was a bigger gig than mountain guiding.\n\"She provided much-needed emotional and psychological support to this group of 13 young women,\" LeGree said. \"Both Danika and Emilie tirelessly supported the team as they encountered homesickness, injury and fear. Danika is truly motivated by helping others and does not need her own ego stroked. This program was about supporting the girls, not about us Westerners, so her humility and competence were just the right blend.\"\nGilbert, who works full time as a grant writer, has led many trips with adaptive athletes, taking them ice climbing in Ouray and up the Grand Teton and even climbing in the daunting Black Canyon of the Gunnison, often as a volunteer guide with Boulder's Paradox Sports .\nThe Afghanistan expedition — and others planned in the coming years — \"is a culmination of a whole bunch of different parts of my life coming together toward this goal,\" Gilbert said.\nTimmy O'Neill, the professional climber and storyteller from Boulder who served as the leader of Paradox Sports until last year, said Gilbert's passion for sharing the power of mountains \"cannot be contained.\"\n\"She's already chosen this harder path that leads into the mountains and sees adventures with the underprivileged — be it Afghan women or the paralyzed or the blind — as an opportunity to offer her specialized skills and passion to promote her effective brand of enduring, positive transformation,\" O'Neill said.\nGilbert also is a quick thinker. After more than a year of planning and training, the Afghanistan project shifted midstream. Mount Noshaq became a security risk because of nearby military skirmishes. And an earthquake frightened the Afghan climbers, who considered the temblor a bad omen. So Gilbert and Drinkwater instead eyed three 16,000-foot peaks in the Panjshir Valley.\nThey spent 16 days climbing on snow, up vertiginous rock and talus fields. They summited three peaks, even getting to name one that had not been scaled. They named it \"The Lion Daughters of Mir Samir,\" after the magnificent peak that dominates the valley.\nIn addition to fitness and commitment, participation in the Ascend expedition requires public service. The girls are expected to return to their communities and share what they've learned; become leaders who can inspire more women to do more.\nThe plan for next year is to divide the growing number of young women who want to participate into two groups, like a varsity and junior varsity team. Next year Gilbert hopes to lead the best climbers up Mount Noshaq.\nBut the goal is not summits. It's about building bonds with fellow women and amplifying often-hidden strengths. And, of course, any trip in the hills is about fun.\nDanika Gilbert has been touring the state with a presentation about the Ascend expedition into the Hindu Kush. She's planning several metro-Denver dates.
