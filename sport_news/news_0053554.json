Many go over 100 mph. The stands are full of families, many saying the sport is in their roots and is an experience unique to the area.\nOne driver has been competing since he was a kid, and races in his aunt's old hot rod.\n“It’s a treat to me just to come here, back to the same track that I had always watched and always dreamed about as a kid, so dreams do come true they just take a long time to get there sometimes,” says Kevin Amer.\nSeveral competitions are held at the dragway, juniors ages 5 to 17 can even compete, going up to 90 mph in \"half-scale dragsters.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:19:49.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
