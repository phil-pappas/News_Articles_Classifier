I repeat that it seems very serious. Referees already have a difficult enough job without adding more fuel to the fire.\n\"What seems logical and licit to me is that it is fully investigated to see if it is true or it is something that someone has invented.\n\"In this country I believe anything can happen.\"\nOn the field, Enrique confirmed that Andres Iniesta is in contention to make his return from injury against Eibar on Sunday after a month out with a hamstring injury.\nAnd the Barca boss also took the chance to send club legend Johan Cruyff the best wishes on the part of the playing and coaching staff after the Dutchman was diagnosed with lung cancer this week.\n\"It is very sad news. We wish him all the best and know he will overcome this as he has other problems throughout his life.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:48:03.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
