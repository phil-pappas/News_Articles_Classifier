Defensively, they gave us a look they hadn't really shown us.\nThe Patriots kept Tom Brady upright in the second half and it paid off with 17 points and two touchdown passes.\nBelichick was not surprised by how well defensive end Greg Hardy and linebacker Rolando McClain disrupted the pocket.\n\"(Hardy's) a good player,\" Belichick said. \"I've said that all week. McClain, too.\"\nBrady completed 20-of-27 passes for 275 yards and two touchdowns but was battered throughout.\nAsked if Brady's performance answered any questions about his toughness, Belichick said, \"I don't think anyone's ever questioned Tom's toughness. Who's done that?\"\nBelichick noted how linebacker Jamie Collins \"seemed to be all over the field.\"\nAs for Dion Lewis, the breakout star of the offense this season, the running back's production, including his tackle-breaking 10-yard touchdown catch, is no longer a surprise, either.\n\"Dion's been giving us a lot of productive plays,\" he said. \"He's been doing it for us all year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:08:26.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
