The oddsmakers finally reigned things in this week after Michigan State failed to cover spreads of at least 23 points in the past three games.\nListed as 23-point favorites, the Spartans squeaked out a 24-21 win over Purdue on Saturday. Michigan State's biggest win was a 20-point triumph over Central Michigan on Sept. 26.\nThe Spartans were 22-point favorites over Rutgers in their matchup last November. Michigan State easily covered in a 45-3 win .", "external_links": ["http://www.vegasinsider.com/college-football/odds/las-vegas/?s=3309"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:50:19.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
