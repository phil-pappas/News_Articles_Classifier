The news is even more grim for Jimerson, who suffered torn ligaments in his knee that will end his varsity career following upcoming surgery. \nBut East Coweta (5-1, 2-1 in Region 3- ) still has plenty to play for in its final four region games while still in the thick of the playoff race. The Indians are now tied with Newnan and Westlake in the loss column while one game behind Hughes, which still has to play both \nthe Cougars and Lions this year. East Coweta has already defeated Westlake and can equally gain a head-to-head tiebreaker in its annual meeting with Newnan on Oct. 30 at Drake Stadium. \nFirst, however, the Indians need to take care of business tonight against a much improved Pebblebrook lineup. Last week, the Falcons (3-3, 1-2) won its first region game since moving into 3- in 2013, defeating Cobb rival Campbell 27-6 at home while in its first sea- son under head coach Kevin Saunders. \nDespite allowing a season-high 29 points at Langston Hughes last week, the Indians loss came down to a poor third-quarter that allowed the Panthers to pounce for a pair of scoring drives. \n“The only difference between winning and losing is Saturday,” Pardue said. “If you win on Friday, you are happy on Saturday, if you lose, you are not.” \nThe veteran coach is also not bothered with the off-field festivities that come with homecoming that some may feel can be a distraction. \n“I don’t mind homecoming,” he said. “It’s a little bit different, but I want our kids to enjoy it. They know there are things that they have to get done, but they need to have fun.” \nWith Jimerson out of the lineup, the Indians have lost one of their most vocal leaders. \n“You have really feel for Alec,” Pardue said. “He is really one of leaders and to get hurt like that your senior year is awful.” \nOn the other side of the ball, East Coweta has a capable fill-in for LaGuardia at quarterback. Sophomore Christian Reid, who gained playing time in a blowout win over Whitewater, scored two late touchdowns after enter- ing the game for his teammate in the second half. \n“I think our kids have a really good attitude this week,” Pardue said. “I don’t think our preparation was as good as it could have been last week. I think we have their attention this week.” \nPebblebrook (3-3, 1-2) comes into the contest fresh off a 27-6 victory over Campbell to snap a two-game losing streak. \nIt was also the Falcons first region win in 10 games. \nPardue understands Pebblebrook is trying to build something. \n“They have some quality", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:48:38.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
