There was some concern about whether Harvey would be able to start after taking a liner off his right triceps Saturday, but he’s good to go.\nHarvey threw Monday during the team’s workout at Wrigley, and pitching coach Dan Warthen said there are \"no concerns on our behalf\" about the right-hander. Manager Terry Collins did say Harvey’s triceps still was pretty swollen from the line drive.\nIf Harvey starts a second game against the Cubs, it will come a series after he was limited to just one start due to his innings restriction. Harvey has thrown a career-high 202 innings this season. \nFORGETTING IT: Jacob deGrom went 0-2 with a 6.10 ERA in two starts this season against the Cubs, and is 0-2 with a 6.46 ERA in his three career starts against them.\nDeGrom said he hasn’t analyzed those starts, and is instead trying to forget about them. He prefers to analyze starts in which he had success instead of those he struggled in.\n\"The ball carries pretty well here,\" deGrom said. \"I think going into this, my game plan is going to be to try to get a lot of ground ball outs.\"\nSTAYING THE SAME: A source confirmed pending free agent Daniel Murphy’s torrid postseason is not likely to alter the team’s thinking regarding his future with the organization. While it will give the team more to dissect, signs point to Murphy playing for a new team in 2016.\nThe organization could make a qualifying offer, but there is risk/reward on both sides. Murphy will become one of the team’s highest-paid players for one season if he was to accept, but the team also could gain a compensation pick if he signs elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:45:24.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
