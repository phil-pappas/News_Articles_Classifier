Here are a few highlights.\nWhat was your take on the Oklahoma State-Texas officiating?\nCarlton: \"Curious, strange, unusual and in a few cases, downright wrong. But I've seen equally odd and incorrect calls at other Big 12 games over the years. It's kind of a conference tradition. As for conspiracy theories, I'm not buying. The game still came down to a punter not holding a snap. I save my tinfoil hat for real serious stuff -- like chemtrails.\"\nIs Charlie Strong unlucky or are the losses because he hasn't prepared his guys well?\nCarlton: \"When you lose consecutive games on a missed extra point and a messed up punt snap, yeah, you might want avoid ladders, black cats and the number 13. At the same time, late-game decision-making wasn't a strength against Oklahoma State this season and UCLA last year. Texas needs to get better in those areas. It could also use a break or two.\"\nIs it misguided to believe that Texas is at least some what at fault for running off teams to other conferences and the current state of the BIG12?\nCarlton: \"Texas and specifically the Longhorn Network didn't exactly help relations with other schools. Depending on your allegiances, it gave Texas A&M either a valid reason or a handy excuse to bolt for the SEC. But if there wasn't a LHN, Texas probably would opted for the Pac-12 and there wouldn't be a Big 12 as we know it now.\"\nDoes a thrashing by TCU (safe guess, right?) send Texas into a mentally soft tail spin of blowouts? Curious to see if Strong does better against OU than Mack did, but a demoralizing loss the week before will throw off my experiment.\nCarlton: \"It's certainly possible with a young team. For now, Texas seems to have held up well. If 1-3 turns into 1-5, who knows even though the Texas schedule gets far more manageable the second half of the season. One key for the next two weeks is the status of right tackle Kent Perkins. If he's not available, the offense could struggle -- and that wouldn't be good against TCU and OU.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FULL CHAT.\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:38:31.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
