Absolutely. But I'll take a team that will fight over a team that won't — that will sit back and take it — any day of the week. And bring on the next team. So that's how I look at it. Give me a team that's got some fight and will compete until the very end — right, wrong or indifferent — no matter how good the officiating is or whatever. Makes no difference to me. I'll take the team with some competitive fight and some spirit. Seventeen penalties ridiculous? Absolutely, 100 percent, it's ridiculous. So say what you want, but I'll take a team that will fight. I'm proud of this team and we'll keep fighting and eventually we'll find a way to win, eventually we'll find a way to eliminate penalties.\"\nAudio from Ryan's press conference:\nAt what point, though, does Ryan put it on himself and his players to limit the penalties that have cost this team in both of its losses? Ryan didn't offer specifics but promised to get it corrected while digging at reporters for focusing on the negatives.\n\"We've got to play within the rules,\" Ryan said. \"We all know that. Did it happen today? Apparently not. We had 17 penalties, two touchdowns called back, a fumble, all that kind of stuff. I get it. No question about it. We can focus on the negatives — and I get it, it's all your guys' job — but you might not understand the game the way I understand it. I've been on the other side. I've been a part of a 20-some-penalty performance by the Ravens, OK? We went on and fixed it. We'll fix it here. But one thing is, we've got heart, and at least I know we got that. I will line it up, regardless of the stuff we take negative-wise, we'll be standing there, right there, and ready to toe the line again rest week. I promise you that.\"\nDespite his team ranking near the top of the league in penalties, Ryan seemed to take offense when asked whether his team lacks discipline.\n\"I don't know,\" Ryan said. \"You guys write the stories, so I guess you'll write it the way you want to write it. The one thing I know for a fact is we've got heart. The discipline thing, I get it. When you have 17 penalties, that's obviously a sign of a lack of discipline. That's not the real deal, but hey, it's a free country, write what you believe.\"\nRyan was then asked why he's changing his tune after saying his team needed to be smarter after a loss to the Patriots.\n\"I'm not changing anything, but I'm going to change the results,\" Ryan said.\n\"I think everybody needs to keep our poise, 100 percent. You're exactly right on that. I think everybody needs to, and I'm talking about everybody.\nWhen asked what he meant, Ryan said, \"Me, obviously.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:14:26.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
