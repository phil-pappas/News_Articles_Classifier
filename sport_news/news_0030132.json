Lack made three preseason starts for the Canes, recording a win and stopping 68 of 73 shots against. Before the start of the season, Carolina signed Lack to a 2-year, $5.5 million deal. \nThe Canes will be in action Tuesday night at 7 p.m. at PNC Arena to play the Panthers who scored seven goals Saturday in their opening night win against Philadelphia.
