I've been told USC is still in the early stages of compiling a list of coaches to go after. Ed Orgeron, I'm told, will not be on that list. â€” Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) October 12, 2015 \nOne notable name with ties to USC is current LSU defensive line coach Ed Orgeron. It would make sense to kick the proverbial tires on Orgeron, considering his history with the university. \nHowever according to a report from ESPN.com, Orgeron isn't on USC's preliminary list of coaches to potentially replace Sarkisian. \nOrgeron had been USC's recruiting coordinator and defensive line coach during the Pete Carroll dynasty. He then returned under the Lane Kiffin regime, and ultimately filled in as the interim coach once Kiffin was fired. Orgeron opted not to return to USC once Sarkisian was hired for the head coaching job. \nOrgeron's impact has been already felt in Baton Rouge. After struggling to get after the quarterback in 2014, LSU currently ranks within the top half of the conference in sacks. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
