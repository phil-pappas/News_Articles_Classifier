I look forward to how we get me involved,” said Hicks, who noted that he is a friend of Chandler Jones and a few other players on the team, but still getting acclimated socially.\nHis fourth year in the league, Hicks spent all four of them in New Orleans before coming to Foxboro. The 6-foot-5, 324-pounder was drafted in the third round in 2012 and has compiled 119 tackles and six sacks along the way, but his slide down the depth chart on the bayou made for an easier swap with the Pats, who had joint practices with the Saints in West Virginia this preseason.\nThat of course gave Pats coach Bill Belichick and the rest of his staff a chance to get a closer evaluation of him, and, per usual, Hicks’ versatility drew most of the praise.\n“I definitely want to be as versatile as I have been in the past, but just look forward to playing in this new scheme,” Hicks said. “I don't have a hold on it yet, but I'll learn as the year goes on.”\n“Well, we’ll see how it goes with him here,” Belichick said in a conference call on Sunday. “He played some different spots at New Orleans, from anywhere from the center out to the five-technique. So, we’ll see how that goes here.”\nIf it goes the way the Patriots want, he will add depth to a defensive line that has been hit-or-miss against the run so far this year. While the Jaguars didn’t exactly light the Patriots up on the ground, Jacksonville trailed the entire game, so that wasn’t going to be an issue for New England’s defense.\nBut both the Bills and the Steelers in the first two weeks had success running the ball, both on the perimeter and up the middle. Even though Hicks is versatile enough to be further outside, it’s likely he’ll be needed more on the interior.\n“Big guy, physical player,” Belichick said. “We got a good look at him down (in West Virginia) and thought that he did some good things. So, we’ll just put him into it here and see how it goes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:29:21.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
