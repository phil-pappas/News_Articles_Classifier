They expressed resentment over the Sikh clergy’s decision to exonerate Dera Sacha Sauda chief for an alleged act of blasphemy and demanded to review it. The activists from Rode, Bhaga Purana, Manawa and other villages performed ardas at Akal Takht and assembled outside the Takht secretariat. They raised slogans against the Akal Takht Jathedar. Their representatives met Giani Gurbachan Singh and submitted a memorandum to him. The activists protested the arrest of their colleagues and stated that such moves would not deter them to sensitise the Sikh masses against the decision to pardon dera head. The Sikh activists assembled at Rode in October 7, the ancestral village of late Jarnail Singh Bhindrawale, in Moga district. The aim was to reach out to the Sikh community in the rural belt to raise voice against Akal Takht’s decision and ensure maximum participation in “Sarbat Khalsa” call of various Sikh organisations ahead of Diwali. Some of the activists, including Jagtar Singh, were arrested the same day as a preventive measure. They were produced in the SDM court at Baghapurana town which remanded them in judicial custody for seven days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:02:30.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
