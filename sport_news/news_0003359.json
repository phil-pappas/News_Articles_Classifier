Dunlap (concussion) and Franklin (ankle) missed the previous three games, with the Chargers (2-4) losing the last two. \n“I’m glad to be back,” Dunlap said. \nCenter Chris Watt (groin, concussion) also practiced, although he was limited and is questionable for Sunday. Watt was idle the last three games, too. \n“We had a number of guys practice, which is kind of a change for us,” coach Mike McCoy said. “It was nice to have everybody out there and we had a good week of preparation. The entire team did.” \nWide receiver Keenan Allen practiced for the first time this week. Allen, who leads the league with 53 receptions, hurt his hip in Sunday’s loss at Green Bay. Against the Packers, Allen had 14 catches for 157 yards. \nAllen is confident he’ll be OK for the Raiders (2-3), the Chargers’ first game against an AFC West foe. \n“I’m there,” said Allen, who is questionable. “I’m playing and I’ll be out there.” \nAllen said the time off was appreciated. \n“That was good to come back and give my legs a break and be as fresh as possible,” he said. “Hopefully I can run like I need to and get out of my breaks. I don’t feel like I’ve lost a step or anything, I should be good.” \nLinebacker Manti Te’o (ankle) and tight end Antonio Gates (knee) didn’t practice. Te’o is doubtful for Sunday; Gates is questionable. \nRunning back Melvin Gordon (ankle), who was benched after his second fumble Sunday, was limited and is questionable against the Raiders. \nWide receiver Stevie Johnson (hamstring) practiced and is questionable. Safety Eric Weddle (groin) is out. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:04:41.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
