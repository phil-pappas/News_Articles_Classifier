BYU women’s golf wins their second tournament of the year at the Aggie Invitational. It finished with five players in the top 20. (Sarah Hill) \nThe BYU women’s golf team has only played in three tournaments so far this season. They’ve won two of those tournaments, the latest a victory at the Aggie Invitational on Wednesday, October 7. \nBYU women’s golf showed their superiority once again as they won the Aggie Invitational in Las Cruces, New Mexico. It finished with three players in the top 20 and three players in the top five. The Cougars also completed the tournament with 45 birdies through three rounds. \n“It was another great overall team effort,” BYU head coach Carrie Roberts said in a press release. \nThe Cougars domination at the Aggie Invitational showed because of how far ahead they were in the standings. The only other team to finish the tournament close to the Cougars was New Mexico State which had a score of even par. Idaho then finished third at 21-over par. The gap between Cougar’s score and the other team’s scores was quite large. \nKendra Dalton and Alex White both finished at two-under par and tied for second place. Freshman Rose Huang continues to impress as she finished one-under par and tied for fourth. It is very impressive that Dalton and Huang both already have two top five finishes this season. It is even more impressive that Huang has been able to finish high in her first collegiate tournaments. \nLea Garner and Brooklyn Hocker didn’t finish as high as their fellow counterparts but they still played well. Garner finished 14th at four-over par and Hocker finished tied for 16th at six-over par. \nThe BYU women’s golf team takes a break next week before continuing their fall tournament play in the Rainbow Wahine Invitational in Wahiawa, Hawaii on Oct. 20-22.
