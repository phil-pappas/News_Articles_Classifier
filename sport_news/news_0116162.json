Listen to them roar as Oregon Department of Education Deputy Superintendent Salam Noor announces the Teacher of the Year!\nPosted by Bend-La Pine Schools on Monday, October 26, 2015 Anderson, a native Oregonian, got her start in the profession as a fifth-grade student teacher in Mexico, according to the news release. Anderson became fluent in Spanish and spent the next five years at a high poverty school in Maryland.\nAnderson strongly believes that all students can succeed regardless of their background and encourages \"student confidence, exploration and risk-taking,\" the news release states.\n\"I believe much of the success I have experienced in my career can be linked to two things: the high quality professional learning I participated in as a beginning teacher and the collaborative work I have done in Bend La-Pine Schools, both at the school level and at the district level,\" Anderson wrote in her Teacher of the Year application, according to the state. \"My greatest accomplishment in education is empowering children to become thriving lifelong learners.\"\nSee photos from the assembly.\nAnderson will serve as a spokeswoman and representative for Oregon teachers. She will also travel to Washington D.C. this spring to meet President Barack Obama and the U.S. Secretary of Education. Anderson will also receive $5,000.\nOregon schools chief Salam Noor and Bend-La Pine Superintendent Shay Mikalson joined in honoring Anderson.\n\"Tenacious, dedicated, and a life-long learner, Heather is a true asset to her school and our state,\" Noor said in a statement. \"Not only does she set high expectations for her students and herself, she is deeply committed to helping other educators learn and grow.\"\nThe Oregon Teacher of the Year program is supported by the Oregon Lottery. Anderson will take over for 2015 Teacher of the Year Michael Lindblad , a Gresham High educator.\nCheck back later for more about Anderson.\n-- Laura Frazier\nlfrazier@oregonian.com\n503-294-4035\n@frazier_laura", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/BendLaPineSchools/posts/10153073607441587", "https://twitter.com/frazier_laura", "https://www.facebook.com/BendLaPineSchools/videos/10153073626776587/", "http://www.ode.state.or.us/news/announcements/announcement.aspx?=13345", "https://www.facebook.com/BendLaPineSchools"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:11:01.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
