(AP) - Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield gets another chance to show his skills on the big stage. \nHe already led a dramatic comeback win over then-ranked Tennessee three weeks ago. Now, his 15th-ranked Sooners will host No. 23 West Virginia on Saturday in the Big 12 opener for both teams. \nMayfield, who ranks among the nation’s leaders in passing offense and total offense, set Oklahoma’s single-game total offense record with 572 yards against Tulsa. A strong performance against West Virginia’s No. 1-ranked scoring defense could vault him toward the top of Heisman Trophy conversations. \nMayfield’s elusiveness and running skills have drawn comparisons to former Texas A&M; quarterback Johnny Manziel. Because of that, Oklahoma’s passing game is now as much of a concern for West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen as its running game. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:32:11.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
