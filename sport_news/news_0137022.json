That was my first thought upon learning the Red Sox manager was in remission. \nI'm familiar with so many examples of cancer survivors beating back the beast. There are also many more that had just as powerful of intentions, but ran out of time. My mother just recently won her battle. My dear friend, and former WEEI.com writer, Graig Woodburn, however, went from vital 50-year-old, to unrecognizable in a matter of months thanks to one of the most horrific diseases I've ever witnessed, pancreatic cancer. Lung cancer took my mother-in-law. \nOn any given day, we're never more than a couple of degrees removed from someone battling this awful disease. On any given day, that person could be you or me. \nAug. 14 was Farrell's day and it served as a sobering reminder that this threat lurks around every corner. \nAlmost 10 weeks later, he punctuated a more lasting lesson. Farrell gave a very public example of what can happen if you stand tall when your body rebels from the inside. \nI'm not about to say Farrell was stronger than anybody you know who battled cancer. And this isn't a declaration in regards to the good and bad of the subject as a major league manager. \nThis is an opportunity to appreciate the bits and pieces I was able to witness during the 53-year-old's ordeal. It just so happens that, thanks to Thursday's news, the images and words that make up my memory of this battle have seemingly produced a happy ending. \nI remember Farrell keeping his secret those days in Miami. He had been taken in for hernia surgery in Detroit after awkwardly picking up an equipment bag. The procedure revealed he had something much worse -- stage 1 Non-Hodgkin's Burkitt lymphoma. But even after the diagnosis, he revealed nothing until days later. \nTo think back at how Farrell handled himself those couple of days in South Florida with so few knowing is amazing in retrospect. We simply wondered how he was going to sit down after incurring a hernia. Without realizing it, we were witnessing the start of him processing the awful news. Thinking back, to me, that was the first sign that this cancer victim was ready, willing and able to dig in for the fight of his life. It might not seem like much, but I believe it was. \nThe timeline of what followed was somewhat predictable, and somewhat not. \nListening to Farrell describe that first nine hours of chemo while sitting in the Fenway Park home dugout was an education. Clearly, this was the payoff for getting through that procedure, simply talking about his lot in life, but doing so while staring out at a baseball field, mostly in uniform. \nWhen the games began, he would go back in his office and use his new vantage point -- watching on television -- as a useful exercise. Removed from the dugout, Farrell found himself identifying flaws in pitchers' deliveries and hitters' swings. \nUpon opening his door to the manager's office, there was not an iota of sorrow or search for pity. If you asked him how everything was, he would give an honest and detailed answer. \"It is what it is,\" would usually break the unavoidable awkward silence, paving the way for the kind of baseball talk that seemed to be perhaps some of his best medicine. \nFarrell lost his hair. He dozed on his couch in the middle of the day. The reality of his treatment hit like the proverbial ton of bricks. \nWas it what he thought it would be? \n\"No,\" he would answer, leaning back in his chair, and tilting his head back. \"I didn't realize it was going to kick the [crap] out of me like this.\" \nBut that was it. The eggshells that visitors tiptoed across upon entering the office disappeared after just a few moments, with Farrell making it clear that baseball conversations might be somewhat halted and drawn out, but never on hiatus. He seemed to almost insist you stay and power through the exhaustion with him, right up until the point both parties forgot the sympathetic impetus for the visit. He clearly did not want pity. \nStill, it wasn't easy. \nThe meetings, check-ups, down days and discomfort were undoubtedly on display for others to see throughout the 70-or-so days. By some accounts, Farrell was still routinely coming into Fenway throughout the offseason, hitting the treadmill once cleared to do so. Those who talked or texted him routinely offered the same sort of general impression the manager had already offered less frequent visitors. \nA recent text check-in was responded to with, \"Doing good, all things considered.\" And then, right into baseball talk. That sort of dynamic hadn't changed, and wasn't about to throughout any of his checkpoints. In his press release, he finished his statement with, \"I look forward to getting back to work and bringing another championship to Boston.\" That seemed about right. \"Getting back to work.\" It was that end-game that he made seem so inevitable. \nBesides the memory of Farrell's resolve, another more symbolic image jumped to mind. \nRewind to his first visit to Toronto as manager of the Red Sox . Upon leaving the umpires in the exchange of ground rules at Rogers Centre , Farrell walked back toward the visitors dugout while a heavy shower of boos cascaded down upon him. He raised his right hand and tipped his cap to the crowd. \nYou think you're going to get to him, but with one tip of the hat the noise is silenced. \nCancer never had a chance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:25:27.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
