I didn’t have much confidence with this golf course so I didn’t expect to win.”\n“I was really nervous heading into the last five holes,” said Chia, who won his last Asian Tour title in 2002 also in Taipei.\nJin, 17, heads for Masters\nThird-round leader Jin Cheng won a place at the US Masters after a passing typhoon caused the cancellation of the final round of the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship in Hong Kong Sunday.\nThe 17-year-old Chinese No. 1 amateur, who shot a course record eight-under 62 in the first round, won the title by one stroke as storms caused by Typhoon Mujigae tore across the exposed Clearwater Bay course.\n“That’s my lowest tournament score ever,” Jin told a news conference after his win, referring to his 62 Thursday. “I think that’s pretty important for this win.”\nHis 54-hole total of 11-under par 199 gave him a one-shot victory over the Australian pair of Ryan Ruffels and Cameron Davis, who shared second place.\nJin’s final action had been a sublime chip to set up what proved to be a winning birdie four at the 18th hole Saturday.\nWith a typhoon warning signal raised, play was halted at 7:41 am and finally cancelled shortly before midday.\nSunday’s washout scuppered the hopes of a repeat win for defending champion Antonio Murdaca of Australia, who had got into contention with a scintillating best of the day 64 in blustery conditions Saturday to lie just four strokes off the lead. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:58:45.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
