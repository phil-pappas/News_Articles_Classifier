AP Photo/Charles Krupa\nCOMMENTARY\nWelcome to Season 4, Episode 6 of the Unconventional Preview , a serious-but-lighthearted, occasionally nostalgia-tinted look at the Patriots’ weekly matchup that runs right here every weekend.\nThe Patriots, who improved to 5-0 last Sunday night with a closer-than-expected 34-27 victory over the Colts, now face their toughest challenge thus far of the season—yep, really—when the 4-1 Jets come to Foxborough. While the Patriots didn’t exact their Deflategate vengeance on the Colts in the manner many among us expected, they did experience something in Indianapolis far more lasting than a 67-point victory. They were willing and prepared bystanders as the Colts tried to execute the most ill-conceived fake punt since … I don’t know ... since the term “punt” was invented, probably by Paul Brown or George Halas or Steve Belichick or someone.\nThe Colts’ botched play made them a laughingstock in the same way the Jets have been against the Patriots from time to time in the past. Obligatory butt-fumble clip … ACTIVATE!\nWhat do you think gets old first? That, or the clip of the Colts’ one-lineman, one-quarterback, no-hope alignment against the Patriots? The correct answer, of course, is that neither will ever get old. They are Football Follies at their finest, forever and ever.\nIt’s a good thing the dunce cap fit the Colts, because these Jets have moved on from their days of playing the loud fool. (Actually, the loud fool has moved on to Buffalo.) The Jets are legit.\nThey are good, maybe better than good. Their defense, with a line stocked with successful first-round picks and Darrelle Revis back where he began, is exceptional, leading the NFL in points allowed, yards per pass attempt and yards per play, among other categories.\nThe offense doesn’t overwhelm with skill, but Chris Ivory is an unsung force at running back, and Brandon Marshall is still one of the premier receivers in the league. Most surprising given their history of employing so many Kotites and Coslets, they actually seem to have a bright and competent coach in Todd Bowles. He is the anti-Ryan, utterly devoid of bluster. Asked this week what beating the Patriots would mean, he replied: “It just means we’re 5-1 and we’ve got to get ready for Oakland.”\nThe Jets? Competent, humble, well-coached? This might take some getting used to. Why, they probably don’t have an illegal and doomed-to-fail fake-punt play in their playbook.\nKick it off, Gostkowski, and let’s get this one started …\nTHREE PLAYERS I’LL BE WATCHING OTHER THAN TOM BRADY\nSebastian Vollmer: Here’s an odd set of stats for you. The Jets lead the NFL in total defense (269.2 yards per game) and have allowed just 75 points on the season. The strength of their defense is that aforementioned defensive line. They are aggressive, with Bowles earning praise for dialing up effective blitzes from all over the field. And yet … the Jets are tied for 28th in the NFL with eight sacks, even with the Colts and Giants and one ahead of the Dolphins and Falcons. I suppose that should be somewhat reassuring for the Patriots, who are dealing with injuries and inexperience on the offensive line. They’ve had to switch Vollmer, usually the right tackle, to the left side to replace Marcus Cannon, who left the Indy game with a toe injury. Cannon, who was replacing Nate Solder (lost for the season with a biceps tear), won’t play this week. The Jets may not stack up the sacks to Mark Gastineau levels, but they will come after Brady, relentlessly and from all angles. It’s on Vollmer, again, to protect his blindside. Even with Brady’s uncanny ability to get rid of the ball quickly, the left tackle’s job is as challenging as it is crucial, especially this week.\nChris Ivory: A question: Do you know where this guy went to college? The answer: Washington State. If you knew that, you are either a Jets fan or own a Drew Bledsoe college jersey. While he had a fine season as an undrafted rookie for the Saints in 2010, averaging 5.2 yards per carry and rushing for 716 yards, he fell down the depth chart a year later, losing carries to Mark Ingram, Pierre Thomas and Darren Sproles. The Jets got him for a fourth-round pick before the 2013 season. He’s had his moments since, running for over 800 yards in each of the past two seasons, including 107 in Week 7 last year against the Patriots. I don’t know that his scattered successes foreshadowed what he’s done this year, though. In four games—the Jets only loss came when he was out with a quad injury—he’s run for 460 yards and four touchdowns at a 5.5 ypc clip. I’m not sure when this guy became Beast Mode The Sequel, but he’s really good, and the Jets should ride him on Sunday.\nGronk: In the past two games, wins over the Cowboys and Colts, he’s totaled 7 catches for 117 yards and a touchdown. That’s not bad by any means—it’s a 56-catch, 936-yard, 8-TD pace, which would be a fine season for mortal tight ends. But it’s less than Gronk usually provides. The Jets have hinted that they will try to get in his face. That strategy tends to fall short in effectiveness. He’s due to throw someone out of the club. It makes sense to start with Antonio Cromartie and work from there.\nGRIEVANCE OF THE WEEK\nI know, we live in a click-bait world, and there’s probably no going back. But can’t there at least be a kernel of honesty in the bait? Jets defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson made (misleading) headlines this week with his response to a question about whether a win over the Patriots would mean more than a typical win. It seems that was a standard line of questioning this week.\nHere is what Richardson said:\n“We’ll let you all write the columns about validating wins and stuff like that. This is going to be another win in the win column, if we go out there and execute and do what we’re supposed to do.”\nHere is what the headlines told us he said:\n“This is going to be another win [for us].”\nRight. Who needs his qualifying “if” and a full explanation of the question that produced the answer if we can portray him as some wannabe Joe Namath. Did he say it? Well, a couple of the words were organized that way, if you dismiss context. Good enough for me. Hit publish, and let the pageviews roll in!\nTeammate Marcus Gilchrist had to put up with similar nonsense. He was accused of suggesting preparing for Tom Brady is no more difficult than preparing for the Redskins’ Kirk Cousins, who is considerably less competent at quarterbacking a football team than Brady happens to be.\nHere’s what Gilchrist said:\n“You prepare [for Brady] the same way you prepare for Kirk Cousins. You don’t change. It’s like turning the light switch on and off because it’s a different person. Kirk Cousins could have easily come out there [the Jets beat the Redskins last week] and we could’ve not played sound football and not been where we were supposed to be and he could’ve looked the same way [as Brady].\n“We can’t allow one game to be bigger than the other. Do we realize the type of player we’re playing against? Yes, we do. But you don’t change. We’ve got to be 1-0 this week, regardless of who it is, [whether it’s] Brady, regardless of who we’re playing.”\nMan, it’s not so much that that stuff was taken out of context. It’s that the people who reported those Quote: s as controversial probably don’t even know what context is.\n‘I HAVE DECIDED TO RESIGN AS THE HEAD COACH OF THE NEW YORK JETS’\nI’m not sure Belichick’s I’m-outta-here-suckers press conference counts as the best day in Patriots history, or was simply a prelude to the best day, but in terms of franchise-altering importance, it’s battling for pole position with the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.\nThis much is certain. It’s the worst day in Jets history, which is saying something considering how many nominees that frequent butt-fumble of a franchise would have for the designation. (Should we activate the butt-fumble clip again? Nah. Instead, how about this timeless classic? Jets first-round NFL draft busts through the years … ACTIVATE!]\nMy favorite part is the beefy fan with the mustache explaining why the Jets took Ken O’Brien when Dan Marino—whom they were rumored to covet—was still on the board.\n“Obviously the Jets know something that the people up here don’t.”\nI wonder how many years later it was before he realized the people up there actually did know more than the Jets. Probably not too many.\nPREDICTION, OR PLEASE DON’T DENIGRATE AND DISMISS WHAT DARRELLE REVIS DID HERE LAST YEAR, OK? ALL RIGHT, FELLAS?\nYeah, he’s the enemy once and again, and he made a snarky Deflategate joke or two, and you really hope Julian Edelman lights him up on Sunday. I get all of that. But man, I’ve heard from a few of you who have taken it to another level, suggesting that Revis really wasn’t all that important and was perhaps even a little overrated during his layover in New England last year. Stop, please. He was excellent, play to play, week to week. He was probably the third most-important player on the roster last season, after Brady and Gronk. It stinks that he left (though you cannot fault the Patriots for not matching the Jets’ godfather offer). It’s annoying that he likes New York better. It’s OK to feel jilted. But that fourth banner may not have been raised without him. Remember him well, even if you savor watching Brady beat him for a deep touchdown Sunday. And I think he will. Call it greatness trumping greatness.\nPatriots 27, Jets 17.\nChad Finn can be reached at finn@globe.com .
