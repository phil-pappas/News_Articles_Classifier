Lost to Tampa Bay Lightning in first round. \nCOACH: Jeff Blashill (first season, first NHL season). \nADDED: C Brad Richards, D Mike Green, C Dylan Larkin. \nLOST: Coach Mike Babcock, C Stephen Weiss, G Jonas Gustavsson. \nPLAYER TO WATCH: Tomas Tatar. The 24-year-old Czech winger had a team- and career-high 29 goals last season, increasing his total by 10 from the previous year. Tatar has developed chemistry with 35-year-old center Brad Richards and may end up leading the team in scoring after trailing just Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk in points last season. \nOUTLOOK: It's tough to count out the Red Wings because they've been to 24 straight postseasons, winning four Stanley Cups during the remarkable stretch. Detroit seems to have struck a balance between leaning on veterans and counting on younger players to produce. The key competition will be in net, where Jimmy Howard is trying to hold off Petr Mrazek after losing his job to him during the playoffs. \nAll content copyright Â©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:01:35.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
