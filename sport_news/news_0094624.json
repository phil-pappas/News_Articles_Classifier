I know I am the only one to have four but I want more. \n\"That implies winning trophies with the world's greatest club. This year will be no different and we want to win La Liga, the Cup and the Champions League. I hope we see each other again next year.\" \nRonaldo has had a relatively subdued start to the latest La Liga campaign with five goals in seven appearances. All five came in one match, a 6-0 romp at Espanyol last month. \nHe has a much better return in the Champions League, hitting five goals in two Group A outings, including a hat-trick against Shakhtar Donetsk. \nA global icon and one of the most prolific goalscorers of all time, he is the leading marksman in Europe's elite club competition with 82 goals, five ahead of Barca's Argentina forward Lionel Messi. \nMessi, who scored 58 goals in all competitions last term and 38 in La Liga, holds the record for the most in Spain's top flight in one season of 50 set in 2011-12.
