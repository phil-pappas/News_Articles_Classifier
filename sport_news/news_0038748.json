The series is currently deadlocked (36-36-1) until the two teams meet on Saturday where Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury will try for his first win against the Bears. Baylor introduced a new trophy into the equation this season, which will be awarded to the winner of the Texas Farm Bureau Insurance Shootout. Last year's meeting was indeed a shootout, in which the Bears emerged victorious despite six touchdown passes from Patrick Mahomes. Saturday's matchup also marks the first time in school history the Red Raiders will play back-to-back top-five nationally ranked teams. Texas Tech is the nation's only program to face two top-five opponents in its first five games of the 2015 season and was seconds away from topping then-No. 3 TCU last week.\nWhen Texas Tech has the ball\nAll eyes will be on Patrick Mahomes and whether or not he will take the field alongside the Red Raiders' offense on their first possession. Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury doesn't want Mahomes' mobility or playmaking abilities limited by the injury. \"If he can't play his game, then he won't go,\" Kingsbury said after Tuesday's practice . Also keep an eye on Mesquite Horn graduate Jakeem Grant's involvement. Grant dropped three passes in Texas Tech's loss against TCU and offensive coordinator Eric Morris knows the Red Raiders will need more consistency from the senior against their second top-five opponent in as many weeks. \"He had three drops [against TCU] and that's something he hasn't done this year,\" Morris said. \"We can't go back to where we were last year with him, where he's really high and really low. He's got to be more consistent and we're going to find ways to get him the ball and he can't drop it like that.\"\nWhen Baylor has the ball\nNotice the balance. There wasn't a team in the Big 12 last season with a more balanced offense than the Bears. Baylor leads the Big 12 in rushing offense, averaging 379 yards per carry and 7.8 yards per attempt. In comparison, Texas Tech has struggled against the run. The Red Raiders rank last in rushing defense, allowing 254.8 yards per game and 10 touchdowns on the ground. Texas Tech's ability to create and force turnovers under defensive coordinator David Gibbs will be at a premium against Baylor. The Red Raiders allow the most passing yards within the Big 12 (301 yards per game) while the Bears are the third-best passing offense in the Big 12 behind only TCU and Texas Tech. Also keep an eye on the big-play abilitiy of junior receiver Corey Coleman. Coleman leads the Big 12 in receiving yards (153 per game) and touchdown catches (8).\nPrediction\nBaylor's offense has been slicing through defenses, averaging an FBS-leading 64 points with 767 yards of offense per game. Texas Tech proved last season they could make things interesting against Baylor with a healthy Patrick Mahomes. The Red Raiders trailed by 18 points at halftime and the start of the fourth quarter before rallying behind three touchdowns passes from Mahomes and nearly winning the game. Texas Tech can beat Baylor, but only if Mahomes is able to play to his potential and the Red Raiders can negate the Bears' massive offensive numbers by forcing a few turnovers and putting pressure on quarterback Seth Russell.\nScore: Baylor 51, Texas Tech 41\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/30/kingsbury-remains-consistent-status-injured-texas-tech-qb-patrick-mahomes", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/28/baylor-texas-tech-debut-new-rivalry-trophy-farm-bureau-insurance-shootout"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:47:16.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
