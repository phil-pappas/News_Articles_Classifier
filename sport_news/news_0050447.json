Kaiser Convention Center across from Lake Merritt in Oakland, Calif., on Friday, June 19, 2015. (Ray Chavez/Bay Area News Group) ( RAY CHAVEZ ) OAKLAND -- Klay Thompson issued a retort to Doc Rivers after the Los Angeles Clippers coach commented on the Warriors being lucky they faced neither the Clippers nor San Antonio in the playoffs. \n\"Didn't they lose to the Rockets? Exactly,\" Thompson said, laughing in reference to Houston coming from behind to beat the Clippers in the Western Conference semifinals. \"That just makes me laugh. That's funny. Weren't they up 3-1, too? Yeah, tell them I said that. That's funny, man. That's funny.\" \nWalking away from reporters after his interview session, Thompson continued, \"I wanted to play the Clippers last year, but they couldn't handle their business.\" \nRivers touched off the latest tit for tat between the rival teams with his recent comments to Grantland about how the Warriors won the NBA championship. \n\"You need luck in the West,\" Rivers told the website. \"Look at Golden State. They didn't have to play us or the Spurs. But that's also a lesson for us: When you have a chance to close, you have to do it.\" \nRivers alluded to a similar point during media day, saying, \"I thought we matched up well with Golden State last year, you know? We just never got a chance to prove it. Having said that, they kicked our butt last year.\" \nThompson drove home what Rivers conceded. \n\"If we got lucky, look at our (3-1) record against them last year. I'm pretty sure we smacked them,\" Thompson said.

The Warriors have announced they will give away 10,000 replica NBA championship rings to fans attending the game at Oracle Arena.
