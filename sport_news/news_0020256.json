(Channel 2 Action News) “I wouldn’t approach it. I wasn’t going anywhere near it. The guy was huge,” he told Channel 2’s Berndt Petersen.\nNo one seems to know why the big brown bull was on their quiet block or where he came from.\nBrown says it was first spotted last Friday.\nNeighbors say they called police and animal control but so far the bull has managed to elude the authorities. Brown doesn’t know of a farm anywhere nearby.\nBrown shot video of the bull through his car window but says he had no intention of trying to lasso him.\n“His nose was flaring. He did a snort. He was ready,” Brown told Channel 2’s Berndt Petersen.\nNeighbors really want that bull corralled because there are a lot of kids in the area.\nOne county over, neighbors found cows roaming near their homes on Monday.\nPeople in the Farmbrook neighborhood in Rex, in Clayton County, found six cows eating their grass. They say at the rate the cows are going, their grass won’t last much longer.\nNeighbor Mario Irvin says he thinks they’ve figured out who the cows belong to, and now just need to get them back home.\n“There’s a farm behind this house right here, and they broke down a fence. I’ve been told they escaped and here it is. They’re here,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/19/77/ba/bull-roaming.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:11:39.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
