He faces an uncertain future with JR Motorsports after the organization signed Elliott Sadler for next season. JRM also fields a car for defending series champion Chase Elliott and has a multi-driver car. \nCrew chief Jason Burdett picked up a win — and an impostor. The man, who was not identified but said he was a big NASCAR fan, sat at the Dover media center press conference table and answered three questions before he was shooed away by a NASCAR spokesman. \nDenny Hamlin was second, followed by Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch, Ryan Blaney and Kyle Larson. \n\"You can't pass here. You know there's no outside grove to get going on anything,\" Busch said. \nBuescher finished eighth and has a 24-point lead over Elliott. \n\"There's plenty of racing left and this thing is far from over,\" Buescher said. \"If we just go out and run our race and try not to worry too much about the points, we should be in good shape.\" \nTy Dillon is in rough shape after he tumbled from second to fourth in the standings after an early wreck dropped him to 28th in the race. Dillon's No. 4 Chevrolet blew a tire and smacked the wall. \n\"All of a sudden I heard, 'Pow!'\" he said. \nHe was out of the car before the rain hit that red flagged the race for 31 minutes. Smith took the lead off the restart and led 80 of 200 laps. \nSadler, who finished ninth, held the lead when the race was halted. Sadler lost the lead moments before rain hit and caution came to deny him a win in the 2009 Daytona 500. \n\"I've never had much luck with the rain,\" he said. \"I've always been on the wrong side of that.\" \nHe's winless in 28 races this season driving for owner Jack Roush. Sadler has been a regular in Xfinity since 2011 and was twice runner-up in 2011 and 2012 in the championship standings. \nHis arrival at JR Motorsports, which has 26 career Xfinity wins, could squeeze out Smith after three seasons. Smith, who said he was \"looking at every possibility,\" has six career wins in 197 starts and has one win in the elite Sprint Cup level. \n\"I guess it's not going to hurt for solidifying my job status,\" Smith. \nDale Earnhardt Jr. stopped by the media center to congratulate Smith. Smith's future employment was a worry for another day — he was headed out to pound some beers. \n\"I'm going to have a headache tomorrow. I'm not going to lie,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:16:55.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
