Then, they traded touchdowns with the Orange through two overtimes before they stuffed them in the third for the victory.\nThey even got a call to go their way to make the tying drive possible. It arrived in the form of a face-masking penalty against the Orange as Albert Reid was tackled for a 6-yard gain on third-and-15 at the beginning of the drive. The additional 15 yards kept the drive alive.\nIn the third overtime, Jordan Ellis scored on a 3-yard run after Virginia held Syracuse to a 48-yard field goal try that missed. The Cavaliers sacked Eric Dungey for a 6-yard loss on third-and-10 from the 25 to force the long kick.\nThe play left Dungey, a freshman, disgusted with himself.\n\"I saw the pressure coming and I should have gotten rid of the ball,\" he said. \"It's frustrating.\"\nIt didn't help the Orange that overtime went quickly, not allowing their defense to rest after Virginia's regulation-ending drive.\n\"I thought they kept playing hard,\" Orange head coach Scott Shafer said. \"It was hard to tell from the sideline angle, but any gas they had, they left it on the field. ... The kids are exhausted, that's for sure, especially the defense.\"\nDungey threw TD passes in the first two overtimes, but the Orange (3-3, 1-1) lost their third in a row.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:24:30.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
