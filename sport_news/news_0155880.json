With that in mind, therefore, I was very happy to commit to this new deal.\" \nSurrey director of cricket Alec Stewart added: \"Zafar has had another excellent season for Surrey in all formats with both the bat and the ball and fully deserved his England selections. \n\"I have every confidence that he will be around the England side for many years to come and am delighted he has committed his future to Surrey.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:43:00.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
