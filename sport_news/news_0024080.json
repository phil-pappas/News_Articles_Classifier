He scored on runs of 55 and 65 yards. \n\"It goes back to practice,\" Dozier said. \"We believe if you practice perfect, you'll play perfect. \n\"When we have offensive sessions in practice, we work at it. We're always looking to improve.\" \nThe 5-foot-7, 195-pound Hamilton has 34 carries for 324 yards (9.5-yard average) and six touchdowns. \nHamilton scored the game's first touchdown Monday night, taking a handoff from Dozier on West Deptford's signature play - the Wing T inside reverse - and racing 67 yards on the Eagles' second play. \n\"Our offense is flowing right now,\" Hamilton said. \"It all goes back to how hard we work. We put in the time to be able to play like this in the games.\" \nSince beating archrival Haddonfield 10-0 in the season opener, West Deptford has scored 234 points in its last four games (58.5-point average). \n\"I like where we are right now,\" said Folsom, whose team has a bye before an Oct. 23 showdown with Colonial Liberty rival Collingswood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:58:38.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
