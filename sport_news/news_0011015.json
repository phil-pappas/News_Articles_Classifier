We both just hit more consistent so that we could keep the ball in play.\" \n\"Just keep the ball in play, we got it,\" Soika said about what the pair said after the first-set loss. \nNazareth coach Barbara Van Buskirk liked how her two young players fit together as a team. \n\"They both train year round,\" Van Buskirk said. \"They're both hard hitters. We wanted that going into the match. And we just told them to stay focused, keep the ball in play and get their serves in. So that's what they did. Keeping it pretty simple.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:17:21.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
