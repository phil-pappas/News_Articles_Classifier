(Photo: Photo illustration: Greg Hester, USA TODAY Sports) 101 CONNECT 105 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIn honor of Super Bowl 50, here are 50 things we learned in Week 7: \n1. All things considered, we were pleased with experience watching Bills-Jaguars livestream on Yahoo! Added bonus: Didn’t have to watch the boring network pre-game shows. \n2. But we think it threw the NFL Universe all out of whack. Consider the next four items: \n3. The Lions were the first team to score a touchdown in the 1 p.m. ET games. The Buccaneers were the second. \n4. The Dolphins’ Ryan Tannehill, the Lions’ Matt Stafford and the Browns’ Josh McCown started the day a combined 20-for-20. \n5. At one point, the Bucs led 24-0. Dolphins 35-0. Saints 20-0. Raiders 30-6. Tom Brady, Patriots keep Jets in check in AFC East \n6. Kirk Cousins drove the Redskins down the field to win the game - and maybe save Jay Gruden’s job for now - in the final minute to complete the largest comeback in the 83-year history of the franchise. \n7. Buffering ... buffering … buffering … If you don’t get that joke, you didn’t watch the game on Yahoo! \n8. Chuck Pagano. Bill O’Brien. So did you want the movers to pack the china, or will you do it yourself? \n9. Saints coach Sean Payton was 0-for-2 on replay challenges in the first quarter. He was also out of timeouts with 50 seconds to go in the first quarter. The first quarter! \n10. Of course, Payton’s team was up 14-0 at the end of that quarter, so maybe he is onto something. \nEJ Manuel struggled for the Bills in London. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) \n11 . Funny, but the Twitterverse exploded in the morning when E.J. Manuel was struggling, calling the Bills foolish for trading Matt Cassel. By the third quarter of the Cowboys game, not so much. \n12. The Titans have not scored a first-quarter TD in their last five games. That is all. \n13. A quarterback led his team in rushing, while his opposing signal-caller nearly did the same. Not shocking until you realize it was Tom Brady (15 yards) and Ryan Fitzpatrick (29). Both run the 40 in … well, like, forever. \n14. Raiders WR Amari Cooper had 117 yards in the first half against the Chargers, highlighted by a 52-yard touchdown catch-and-run where he had at least six defenders chasing him into the end zone. \n15. At this point, Rex Ryan probably wishes he had Tim Tebow as his backup QB. And we know how he felt about that with the Jets. Matt Cassel can't stop Cowboys' slide against Giants \n16. Thursday Flashback: Impressive showing by the Seahawks defense. But we will reserve judgment until they do it against an NFL offensive line. \n17. Robert Griffin III was inactive after a couple of weeks of being active. Just figured you would want to know. \n18. As expected, the Bills committed as many as stupid penalties on Yahoo! as they do on traditional television. \n19. Matt Cassel’s last 16 starts: 5 wins, 11 losses, 15 touchdowns, 21 interceptions. \nAdrian Peterson's weekend got off to an odd start. (Photo: Tim Fuller, USA TODAY Sports) \n20. The reason Vikings RB Adrian Peterson was downgraded to “questionable” on Saturday? He swallowed his chew on a bumpy flight to Detroit on Saturday, according to FOX. \n21. Peterson denied that, saying it was bad shrimp. TMZ will be on the case in 3, 2, 1 … \n22. The Jaguars had three takeaways coming into the game. Against the Bills, they had three in less than four minutes. \n23. We’re sure Cowboys CB Brandon Carr has had enough of the Giants making one-handed catches against him. Just when people were moving on from Odell Beckham Jr. doing it last season, Rueben Randle did it to him Sunday. \n24. Think about this: Every coach in the AFC South could be fired after the season. Doyel: Colts play like this and they're proud? \n25. We heart Bill Belichick’s sense of humor. On the Patriots' first punt, he kept the offense on the field as long as possible and then ran out the punt team. Just to show how you force an opponent to adjust. \n26. And if you don’t think that was a shot at Chuck Pagano and the Colts, well, you haven’t been paying attention. \n27. By the way, shouldn’t they just have played the Raiders-Chargers game in Los Angeles? The Relocation Bowl. \n28. Dan Campbell: Interim coach of the year. \n29. Replay alert I: Make sure you see the third-quarter touchdown catch by Vikings WR Stefon Diggs. Bell: Mike Zimmer's Vikings look ready to set sail for playoffs \n30. His receivers aren't helping him, but it's officially time to stop waiting for Eagles QB Sam Bradford to break out. He looked off once again vs. the Panthers. \n31. Meanwhile, Chip Kelly needs to feed Ryan Mathews until DeMarco Murray proves he's up to the task. Mathews was the superior option on Sunday night, breaking off an impressive 63-yard touchdown. \n32. Tom Coughlin discipline: On Monday night, Damontre Moore’s penalty for roughing the kicker cost the Giants dearly. Sunday, he was inactive. \n33. Colts WR T.Y. Hilton did a flip into the end zone with his team down 27-0. \n34. Jadeveon Clowney did a sack celebration after the first of his career. And with his team down, 41-0. \n35. Still shaking our head at those last two points. \n36. Other kickers are not going to like Blair Walsh of the Vikings. He was 5-for-5 on field goals Sunday. Meanwhile, PATs remain an issue for some - at least two more missed on Sunday. \n37. The Redskins finally won a third quarter, 14-0 over the Bucs. It was the first time this season they have outscored the opponent coming out of the halftime locker room. so Jay Gruden has that. \n38. Replay alert II: If you didn’t see Tom Brady’s 8-yard touchdown pass to Danny Amendola, you should. Then tell us how Brady did that. \n39. Geez, Colts QB Andrew Luck just looks confused on the field. And frustrated. And, ironically, a lot like Peyton Manning does this season. \n40. That reminds us: The Colts are 1-4 with Luck and 2-0 with Matt Hasselbeck. Just sayin’. \n41. Nothing made us feel better than Chiefs S Eric Berry intercepting a pass, his first since battling back from cancer. \n42. Johnny Manziel made an appearance. And it made us wonder how that NFL investigation into the incident with his girlfriend is going, especially since Manziel might start next week if Josh McCown is still injured. \n43. Didn’t you used to be J.J. Watt? \nTodd Gurley continued his hot start in Week 7. (Photo: Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports) \n44. Todd Gurley had his third straight 100-yard rushing game. Love that guy. \n45. The Redskins and Jets were the first teams to recover onside kicks this season. The first 22 attempts by teams this season failed, according to ESPN. \n46. Arian Foster is likely out for the season with an Achilles injury. Damn. \n47. If the trip to Kansas City didn’t have “trap game” written all over it for the Steelers - with the Bengals up next - we need a new definition of the word. \n48. The Falcons won 10-7 over the Titans. There were zero points scored in the fourth quarter. We almost fell asleep writing those sentences. \n49. Giants running back Orleans Darkwa. His name reminded us we need to get our Star Wars tickets. \n50. Replay Alert III: Dolphins WR Jarvis Landry's catch-and-run for a 50-yard touchdown. It looked like he made every Texans defender miss. \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:03:35.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
