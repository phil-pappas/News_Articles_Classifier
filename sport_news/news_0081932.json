Jhajjar happens to be the home district of Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar. HAFED, the government purchase agency, had recently sent four samples of bajra to assess their quality before procurement, but the DFSO sent them back, stating it had no laboratory for the analysis of food grain, said sources. The DFSO has also asked HAFED officials to get the samples tested in the FCI’s laboratories, besides suggesting that the produce be procured keeping in view its quality as per the government policy. The situation has left the HAFED officials high and dry. “Though all care is being taken while purchasing bajra in the absence of the laboratory check facility, we will have to explain if the FCI rejects the produce due to quality reasons,” said an official. The sources said, “Farmers will have to wait to sell their produce if their samples are sent to other districts for laboratory test.” Bhim Singh, an old farmer from Shahpur village, along with some other farmers had to wait for three days for the procurement of their produce, as their samples were sent for laboratory test for quality check. Rajesh Kumar, a government purchaser, Jhajjar, said the produce of the farmers that was sent to the DFSO for laboratory test had now been procured on the basis of visual report. Suresh Jawa, District Manager (DM), HAFED, said it was the responsibility of the DFSO to get the quality check of bajra samples done from other places if it did not have any facility of laboratory test. “As per government directives, the DFSO will assess the quality of bajra in case of any dispute about the quality. Since the government has set the parameters for the procurement of bajra, quality check is essential in many cases before procurement,” he added. Heaps of paddy await procurement at the Ambala City grain market. Tribune Photo Ambala: The Ambala City grain market is jam-packed with tractor-trailers and heaps of paddy these days, as the procured produce is not being lifted properly. Farmers have been facing problem unloading their produce, as there is no space left in the mandi. Besides Ambala, farmers from surrounding villages of Punjab have also been bringing their paddy to the mandi. The farmers and arhtiyas have held contractors responsible for not making adequate transport arrangements to lift the produce. They said last year also they had to face the same problem. Slow lifting led to the problem of space, forcing the farmers to unload their produce on the Sector 8 ground. The procurement agencies have stocked up their purchase in the sheds of the mandi while it should have shifted to rice mills for milling. A large quantity of empty gunny bags is also stored in the sheds. A few days back during his visit to the grain market, Agriculture Minister OP Dhankar had asked the secretary of the market committee to get the sheds vacated for the farmers. Duni Chandi Danipur, president of the Anaj Mandi Arhtiyas’ Association, said they had been getting the payment of procurement after four-five days, while the government had directed the procurement agencies to make the payment in 72 hours. Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Mandeep Singh Barar said he had asked the procurement agencies to make sure that the farmers were getting the minimum support price of their produce.
