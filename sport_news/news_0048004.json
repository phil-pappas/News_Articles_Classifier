Third in Metropolitan Division. Lost to Washington Capitals in Eastern Conference quarterfinals. \nCOACH: Jack Capuano (sixth season, sixth NHL season). \nADDED: RW Steve Bernier, D Marek Zidlicky, G Thomas Greiss. \nLOST: F Michael Grabner, G Kevin Poulin, D Lubomir Visnovsky. \nPLAYER TO WATCH: John Tavares. Entering his seventh year in the NHL after being selected No. 1 overall in 2009, the Islanders' captain is coming off a brilliant season after an MCL injury cost him the final 22 games of 2013-14. He set career highs for goals (38), points (86) — one fewer than the league leader — and power-play goals (13). He then had two goals and four assists in the seven-game series against Washington. \nOUTLOOK: The Islanders have high expectations as they move into a new home in Brooklyn's Barclays Center after spending their first 43 years on Long Island. After making the playoffs in two of the last three years, a handful of minor roster changes give Capuano predominantly the same team back. There may be an adjustment period early on as the Islanders get used to a new routine and their new arena. Injuries could also play a role at the start as defenseman Thomas Hickey will miss the first month of the season. Returning to the playoffs won't be easy in an improved Eastern Conference. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:29:55.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
