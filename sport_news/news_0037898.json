Times have changed. The Dickson girls are ranked No. 2 in Class 3A and the boys are No. 4 — just in time for the state meet. Throngs of Comets supporters are expected at Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee on Saturday. “I’ve had lots of kids in my classes asking about what it is like to be at a cross country meet, what they should do, what they should bring, all of that kinds of stuff,” Dickson girls coach Jennifer Mays-Krimmer said. “I think the girls are excited to be a part of something like that that is changing the culture of the school.” Prior to this year, the Lady Comets had not been ranked higher than 12th during any of Mays-Krimmer’s first four seasons as girls head coach. There have been state qualifiers during her tenure. Last year, Dickson qualified its entire girls team for state, and went on to place 13th — the Lady Comets, at that time, were in Class 4A. Hawkins, now a senior, is a three-time state qualifier. She earned All-State honors as a freshman for her 10th-place finish. Hawkins’ experience and work ethic has rubbed off on her teammates. “She doesn’t have to say a lot,” Mays-Krimmer said. “They take their cues from her unspoken. They know that she is going to run as hard as they can. Sometimes she might be sick when she reaches the finish line. The other girls look at that and run hard to the finish line, even when they are not feeling well.” But, Dickson’s success is not solely attributed to Hawkins. The freshman class has been a pleasant surprise and a big reason why the Lady Comets have good balance from their No. 1 through No. 7 spots in the lineup. Prior to this year, Sarah Huhman had never ran cross country, but is now Dickson’s No. 2 runner. Landri McClure has improved her time by one minute. Katie Maher ran for Mays-Krimmer in junior high and, so far, has handled the change in the distance and level of competition that comes from running in high school. Page 2 of 3 - “Sarah Huhman has been a huge difference-maker on our team, and I knew it this summer, when I watched her, that she can be special,” Mays-Krimmer said. “Landri McClure has come a long way. At beginning of the year, it was a mental thing. She was my seventh runner earlier this year. The last few weeks, she has been my fifth runner, and not by a little, but by 30 seconds.” The contributions of juniors Aly Goss and Kirstyn Jolly, and sophomores Clary Donica and Meredith Hendry can’t be overlooked. Jolly placed ninth overall. Donica was 11th. Hendry took 23rd. Goss finished two spots behind Hendry, in 25th. They helped to lead the Lady Comets to a runner-up finish at the regional meet last Saturday in Velma. Dickson finished with 59 points, 30 behind two-time defending state champion Marietta. The Lady Indians totaled 29 points. “Everyone is really excited,” Hawkins said. “Ms. Thompson, my chemistry teacher last year, she gives me high fives every time that I see her. Our school is very encouraging.” Comets boys coach Bryce Bell teaches at Dickson Middle School, so he doesn’t get to see the reaction that fellow students give his cross country athletes in the classroom and when walking through the hallway, but when he does, the school has given overwhelming support to his Comets. The strength of the Dickson boys is built around its junior class. Four of its top seven runners are juniors: Brenton Bland, Clinton Bland, Jeremiah McMahan and Austin Parker. Clinton Bland led the Comets at the regional meet with his seventh-place finish. McMahan also placed in the top 10 with his eighth-place finish. Brenton Bland was 11th. Seniors Chance Herriott and Austin Hunter have been solid contributors, and freshman Caden Potter has been a good addition to Dickson. Senior Marshall Lyons, an alternate, said he was the only runner for Dickson’s eighth-grade team, while the seventh-grade team had just three runners. The Comets didn’t have enough runners to field an entire team, one short of the necessary five. Through word of mouth, his friends and classmates have since joined the high school team, and this year, Dickson has more than enough to field an entire team. “I think successful people in track thought they could be successful in cross country, and they have,” he said. It took a few years but Dickson, through hard work, is in position to contend for a state trophy. It’s been a steady climb up the state rankings this year. Prior to the Pre-State Challenge in Shawnee on Oct. 8, Dickson was ranked 12th. Now, the Comets have catapulted all the way up to No. 4. Bell has been impressed by that improvement, and he pointed to two underlying factors. Page 3 of 3 - “Their mentality and their competitiveness is 180 degrees different from last year,” he said. “They compete with each other every day of the week, so when we go out to a meet, that level of competitiveness goes up. That makes it easier to run on Saturdays.” Dickson’s girls entered the Pre-State Challenge at No. 4. The Lady Comets have since moved up two spots to No. 2. That meet validated Mays-Krimmer’s belief, dating all the way back to July when the team began team workouts, of how good her squad can be this season. “I realized then that it wasn’t a fluke that we were going to be consistently good for the rest of the season,” she said. There is pressure that comes for being ranked that high, but both Dickson’s boys and girls cross country teams believe they can both handle it well Saturday in Shawnee, site of the 3A state meet. “We’ve had meets, here and there, where people have ran well, but at the Pre-State Challenge, everybody ran really well,” Bell said. “We had a bunch of people P.R. for the season and some lifetime PRs. They ran way faster than what I was expecting them to run that day. I’m ready to see them take some more time off this weekend.” Earning a team trophy would be the best feeling, Hawkins said. “I would probably cry, probably be in tears,” she said. “I would be real thankful.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:00:51.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
