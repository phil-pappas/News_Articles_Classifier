Parker Fetherston also placed well in the event, earning fifth with a time of 26.19. \n“She finally broke 25 seconds this season which we’ve been wanting for some time,” Peppey said. “Emily then swam the 100 free, and once again, brought her time way down to a 56 which is the first we’ve seen this season too (placing fifth).” \nJefferson’s 200 freestyl relay team also broke the school record on the day. The EagleJays’ Fetherston, Julia Jensen, Megan Duffy and Wright swam a 1:45:93 to break the 1:48.96 mark and go down in school history. The time was good enough for third place out of 19 teams. \n“It was an exciting race, we almost caught Kenosha,” Peppey said. \nIt was the usual suspects for Fort Atkinson on the day. \nFreshman Mariah Marow­sky came in second place out of 33 in the 100 free, with a 56.35 while senior Bailey Weston finished fourth with a 56.49. \nThe two Blackhawks also finished high up in the 200 free as well, with Marowsky earning second out of 26 with a 1:59.89 and Weston in fourth 2:03.55. \nWeston, Marowsky, Devon Oliver and Molly Bare came together for another impressive 400 relay finish, placing third out of 18 with a time of 4:00.27. \nJefferson/Cambridge heads to Elkhorn on Tuesday at 6 p.m. while Fort Atkinson heads to Monona Grove at the same time on Tuesday. This is the final regular season meet before both teams head to their respective conference meets on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:35:25.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
