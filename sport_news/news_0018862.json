At 6-foot-6 and 250 pounds, Hartzell, a tight end and defensive end, really leaps out to an observer on a Salisbury (3-3) team that doesn’t boast enormous size. \n“Our guys aren’t the biggest,” said the Falcons senior. “But they have a huge heart on both lines and that’s how we are able to do what we do. If we work together and play with heart we can do anything.” \nFor example, qualify for the District 11 Class AA playoffs. Salisbury currently holds the fourth and final postseason spot narrowly over North Schuylkill, Palisades and Palmerton. A win over the Bulldogs (4-2), who currently are in the No. 3 slot (behind No. 1 Notre Dame and No. 2 Northwestern Lehigh) would put the Falcons in a very good position. \nAnd if they get there, it may well be due to Hartzell, who is just the kind of powerful and skilled defensive lineman to slow down the Bulldogs’ trademark straight-ahead power ground game. \n“Kyle steps up at key spots,” Salisbury coach Andy Cerco said. “Last week against Northwestern Lehigh (a 30-22 Falcon loss) we stopped them once inside our 5 on four straight runs and Kyle was involved in every one.” \nOn the other side of the ball. Hartzell handles the tight end duties. \n“I have been a tight end since I was four,” he said. “This offseason I wanted to work on my down-blocking as a tight end. I am really happy with the way the offseason worked out because I worked hard at it.” \nHartzell’s work ethic shows in every thing he does. Last spring, for example, he picked up the javelin for the first time. \n“I couldn’t throw it 50 feet the first time I threw it,” Hartzell said. \nHe wound up with a personal-best of 158 feet -- pretty good for a rookie; indeed, pretty good, period. \n“Kyle is an all-around good kid,” Cerco said. “He’s not a rah-rah kid, he leads by example.” \nLeadership at Salisbury means being highly respected by peers that Hartzell has known for almost his whole life in a close-knit community. \n“We didn’t have lot of success in youth football,” Hartzell said. “We started to do better when we got to the Colonial League. These kids are all family to me. I want to keep playing with for them for as many games as we can and I never want to let them down.” \nSalisbury’s biggest problem this season may indeed be the occasional letdown. The Falcons have played more than respectably in losses to Colonial League powers Saucon Valley, Notre Dame and Northwestern but have not broken through with a signature victory. Northern Lehigh offers another chance. \n“Sometimes we do get down on ourselves, especially after we’ve given up a big play,” Hartzell said. “I don’t think it’s anything we’re doing, or not doing, specifically, in those games. The other team makes a couple of big plays, and we get down on ourselves. We have to stop doing that.” \nOn the bright side, Salisbury has handled adversity well in at least one game, a 35-14 defeat of Pen Argyl when the Green Knights led 14-0. \n“That game shows us we have the leadership to come back and win,” Hartzell said. “We have to build off that game. We know we’ve done it before and we can do it again.” \nIt would mark a standout win for Salisbury if they did again Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:39:52.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
