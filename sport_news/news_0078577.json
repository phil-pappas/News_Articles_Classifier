(AP Photo/Joseph Nair) comments Tweet SINGAPORE â€” Maria Sharapova won her first match since the Wimbledon quarterfinal in a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory against Agnieszka Radwanska at the WTA Finals on Sunday.\nSharapova was sidelined after the Wimbledon semifinals until the Wuhan tournament in China four weeks ago with a prolonged foot injury.\nShe retired in the third set of her first match at Wuhan with a left wrist injury.\nSharapova, looking rusty from the lack of match play, needed 2 hours, 47 minutes to finally nail down the win against Radwanska.\nShe served for the match at 5-2 and dropped her serve. At 5-4, she double-faulted on her first match point, but won the match two points later when Radwanska netted a forehand.\nThis marked Sharapova's 13th career win in 15 matches played against Radwanska.", "external_links": ["http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url=", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Sharapova+edges+Radwanska+in+opening+match+at+WTA+Finals"], "published": "2015-10-25T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:44:32.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
