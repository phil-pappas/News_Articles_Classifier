With the captain and Barcelona wizard recuperating at home in Catalunya, the Albiceleste were deservedly beaten for the first time ever at home to Ecuador, and to tell the truth the 2-0 scoreline, if anything, could have been even more emphatic.\nAdChoices No team has ever qualified from the exhausting CONMEBOL group having lost its first match in front of its own fans. The Albiceleste must now regroup and try to beat Paraguay in Asuncion, a daunting task. But the biggest dilemma faced by coach Gerardo Martino is how to replace the best player in the world and keep his team on course.\nThere were mitigating circumstances for Thursday's debacle. Sergio Aguero had looked bright early on and went close to scoring before tearing his hamstring 20 minutes in, the real final straw for Argentina's attack which subsequently looked ponderous and predictable.\nThe defense, meanwhile, never the nation's strong suit, was weakened by the loss of first-choice fullbacks Pablo Zabaleta and Marcos Rojo. Left-sided replacement Emanuel Mas endured a horror show as he was time and again exposed by Antonio Valencia, while on the other flank Facundo Roncaglia looked what he is, a second-rate utility man without either the defensive capability or attacking prowess to function at this level.\nBut the most pressing issue for Argentina came in the middle of the field, exactly the area where, to the detriment of his offensive game, Messi is usually so decisive. We knew there would be an impact to the side's fluidity, but the sheer magnitude of the collective short-circuit was worse than anybody could have feared.\nFor years La Pulga's inability to match his prodigious Barcelona strike rate in international colors has vexed Albiceleste fans. But only now he is unavailable is his true importance noticed. The No. 10 tracked back precisely because of the weakness sensed behind him, in a midfield too static to carry out the role necessary in an attacking, high-press 4-3-3 system.\nDuring Barcelona's victorious 2014/15 Liga campaign, 60 percent of Messi's touches occurred in the final third of the pitch. In the Brazil World Cup, however, that number descends to just over 54 percent, and July's Copa America was little better with 55 percent of his touches coming in that key area. The Rosario-born star took more than one in 10 of his total touches in Chile in his own half, despite ostensibly playing as a striker.\nThis separation from the goal is reflected in other key statistics. The Argentina captain's shot accuracy plummets almost 20 points from La Liga to the two most recent international tournaments, and while in Catalunya he is involved with a goal on average every 57 minutes, this jumps to almost two-and-a-half-hours in the World Cup and Copa America.\nPerhaps even more tellingly, while in La Liga Messi averaged 8.8 attempted dribbles per game, during the Copa he tried a massive 12.5. Why? Because those running the engine room have not been pulling their weight.\nIn such a formation the three midfield men are absolutely key. Part of Barcelona's recent struggles before the arrival of Ivan Rakitic were down to the painful renewal of the untouchable Xavi-Iniesta-Busquets triangle which made the club such a fearsome prospect. Real Madrid felt the same grief, and after such an explosive start to last season the loss of Luka Modric and a subsequent midfield unbalancing hurt the club dearly. If this area is not working, such an ambitious formation cannot prosper.\nIt is what is known in popular Argentine parlance as the Short Blanket Syndrome. Pull it up to your neck, and you leave your feet exposed. Push it down, and your chest is exposed. Without Messi, the blanket failed to cover either of these key areas.\nThere is nothing wrong with Argentina's attack, even without Messi and Aguero. The likes of Carlos Tevez, Angel Di Maria, Angel Correa, Paulo Dybala and Ezequiel Lavezzi are accomplished performers, if not at the level of those two stricken stars. But who is backing them up?\nJavier Mascherano sits so far back he acts almost as a third central defender, and with Lucas Biglia on Thursday the pair provided almost no impetus to break out of the Argentine half. This is where Messi's withdrawals have been so important. Taking the quarterback role on the halfway line, he has been able to get his side moving, albeit at the expense of attacking potency. Without him the onus was on Javier Pastore, but the Paris Saint-Germain playmaker looked lost and confused against Ecuador and will want to forget the game as soon as possible.\nA more mobile midfielder is necessary to provide the link between defense and attack, and there are few candidates screaming for inclusion. Juventus' Roberto Pereyra is one, as is the injured Enzo Perez, and River Plate starlet Matias Kranevitter should provide more urgency in ball recovery as he deputizes for Biglia in Asuncion. Nevertheless, the center of the pitch still looks unbalanced and ripe for breaking by an opponent with the pace to get forward on the counter.\nArgentina did miss Messi sorely on Thursday, but not for the reasons you may imagine. His goals and magic around the box are always welcome, as they would be in any team. It is the nation's failings further back, however, and the consequent blow this deals to any ideas of collective offensive effort, that make his incursions so essential.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:56:04.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
