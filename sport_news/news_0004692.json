After the number was posted and teammates had shared congratulatory hugs, she was handed a video camera and headed to the Gifford Gym bleachers to tape the final event.\n“It’s for the Wayne Valley Television Network,” said Harden, who now is at full strength after an ankle injury curtailed her 2014 season.\n“They wanted to cover all the fall sports, so I volunteered to help with gymnastics,” she said. “I’m in the TV production class at school, so I have an ‘in.’”\nHer TV classmates also chose an opportune time to capture the Indians (6-1) in action.\nBussanich followed Harden on beam and tied the school record of 9.6 that Sarah Giannella set in a 2006 meet against Wayne Hills.\nOne day after becoming the seventh North Jersey gymnast this season to surpass 36 all-around, Bussanich closed with a 9.4 on floor that pushed her varsity best to 37.05.\nThe freshman equaled Wayne Valley’s all-time floor score, set by Alison Hartwig in 2003, but the mark didn’t last long after that. O’Hanna was the last Indian to perform and tallied 9.425.\n“The fact that Rachael tied the record, and two minutes later, Alexa comes in and breaks it – that was just amazing,” Wayne Valley coach Samantha Colangelo said.\nO’Hanna, the reigning Passaic floor champion, looked like a strong favorite to defend her title at Wednesday’s county meet. The senior recognized how formidable Bussanich has helped make the entire squad as well.\n“Having Rachael on the team is just awesome, because she’s that extra talent who really brings us to the top of our game,” O’Hanna said.\nThe Indians eclipsed 105 for the first time in nine years, and now have the best 2015 score of any Passaic team by nearly six points.\nThursday was extra special for the Wayne Valley seniors – Harden, O’Hanna, Kyra Hirschfeld and Angelica Ingham – who had not experienced a dual-meet win over Wayne Hills (2-5) in their careers, either.\n“We’ve been putting in the work for so many years,” Ingham said, “so to finally be at that level where we’re scoring over 100 is awesome.”\nThe teams held shared Senior Day festivities before the meet, and all healthy seniors competed. Alexis Losito (beam, floor) and Gabby Sausa (vault) contributed for the Patriots, who were without Courtney Conforth due to illness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:08:35.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
