The Rebels fall to 4-1, 2-1.\nHere are three things of note from the game:\n1. Ole Miss suffers another embarrassing defeat away from home\nThe Rebels rose into the national Top 5 for the second straight season on the strength of a victory over Alabama, but proved once again they have trouble handling adversity. Ole Miss' last three losses have been by 28 points (Saturday), 39 points (42-3 vs. TCU in last year's Peach Bowl) and 30 points (30-0 at Arkansas last season. Ole Miss came into Saturday averaging 55 points per game, but did not get into the end zone until there were little more than four minutes remaining.\n2. Florida has re-joined SEC title game race, possibly national conversation\nJim McElwain has turned the Gators around quickly, and has them alone atop the SEC East standings thanks to Saturday's victory and Georgia's loss to Alabama. Florida had struggled to win its first two season games of the year (against Kentucky and Tennessee), but dominated from the outset on Saturday, building a 25-0 halftime lead. The Gators' defense was outstanding, totaling five sacks and forcing four turnovers, two of which led immediately to Florida touchdowns. The Gators should move into the Top 15 nationally when Sunday's rankings are released.\n3. Will Grier might just be a quality SEC quarterback\nThere should be no quarterback controversy for the Gators moving forward, as Grier established himself as a quality SEC passer on Saturday. The redshirt freshman completed 24 of 29 passes for 271 yards and four touchdowns, all in the first half. He completed passes to eight different receivers, and guided a Florida passing game that might not have looked this good since the Steve Spurrier era. Treon Harris might not see any meaningful playing time for a while.\nNEXT UP: Florida is at Missouri next Saturday (6:30 p.m., SEC Network). Ole Miss hosts New Mexico State (11 a.m., SEC Network).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:21:18.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
