It’s very difficult to get the masses interested in the sport in November, but October?? Well, it takes a good old-fashioned sex scandal to move the college hoops needle before Halloween. \nThank you Louisville basketball and Rick Pitino. There is no way any of us truly believe that Pitino didn’t know about the escorts coming to the basketball living facilities. It was the right hand man of Rick Pitino, Andre McGee who orchestrated all the SEX! SEX! SEX for MONEY! \nYou even have key players on the Louisville championship team, Montrezl Harrell and Russ Smith implicated. \nYou have Rick Pitino, who has a long history of acting shady, and there’s no reason to believe him when he claims ignorance. Especially when you consider what emperor-kings, control freaks and micro-managers college coaches are. It’s unfortunate I didn’t bring up this topic with Richard Pitino when I had a semi-exclusive with him at Big Ten Media Day. Of course, that might have been awkward. \nEspecially considering there was one other person at the table with myself and Rick Pitino the Younger. That someone was the victim in a college sex scandal, so….awkward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:15:18.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
