More from KY3 Chiefs hope to end losing streak at home against Steelers \nMaclin missed the first two days of practice this week after suffering a concussion last Sunday. However, coach Andy Reid told the Kansas City Star on Friday that Maclin has satisfied all the requirements of the concussion protocol and will play Sunday as long as concussion symptoms do not return. \nMaclin has 39 receptions for 531 yards this season while playing in six games, all as a starter. \nAlthough Maclin is back from his concussion, defensive end Mike DeVito is not. He has been ruled out for Sunday's game after being unable to pass through the concussion protocol. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
