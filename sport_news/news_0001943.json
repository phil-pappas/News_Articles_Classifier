Signal photo by Katharine Lotze A A A \nKate Zeile played like a rock star. \nValencia head coach Annie Kellogg’s description of the junior singles player seemed off only in that Zeile’s impressive day was hardly glamorous. \nZeile, who was in the No. 1 singles spot for the day, battled back to win her final two sets after a grueling loss to West Ranch’s Quinterra Walter-Eze in round one. \nBut, more importantly, her teammates followed her lead, doggedly pushing past the final leg of back-to-back matches against their stiffest competition on Thursday with a 12-6 win over the Wildcats at West Ranch High. \n“My kids had to come in here with confidence and determination to get it done today,” Kellogg said. “It was very hard-fought.” \nWest Ranch (6-3 overall, 4-2 in Foothill League) entered Thursday’s contest just one win behind Valencia (12-2, 6-0) for first place in league. And the Cats started with a bang. \nZeile and Walter-Eze’s set went for more than 1 1/2 hours, finally ending in a 7-5 Walter-Eze win and a 3-3 tie for sets overall after round one. \nThe victory proved costly for West Ranch, however, as Walter-Eze had to retire with a leg cramp early in her set against Amanda Tabanera in round two. \nTabanera swept three sets for Valencia, as did her teammate Jennifer Shin. \nShin took her sets all by scores of 6-0. \n“We make sure there’s no pressure. Just have fun out there, just play your game,” Shin said. \nWest Ranch did outscore Valencia 5-4 on the doubles side, though. \nBrittany Waugh and Olivia Bloome swept three sets for West Ranch, highlighted by a 6-3 win over Valencia’s No. 1 duo of Lauren Wolf and Gianna Benitez. \nThe Vikings still managed to follow up their 12-6 win over Hart on Wednesday with a big step toward a second straight league title. \nValencia hasn’t lost to West Ranch since 2011. \nHart 11, Canyon 7 \nIt was something like deja vu at Hart High Thursday. \nFor the second time this year, the Indians topped the Cowboys 11-7. \nHart’s doubles team of Alex LaForteza and Cassidy Wilkinson swept three sets for the Indians (7-6, 4-2), who bounced back after a loss to Valencia on Wednesday. \nHart single Natalia Munoz won two sets. \nHer teammate Nicole Alvarez won two sets, as well. \nBut it was Canyon’s Katrina DeGuzman who again stole the show on the singles side. The Cowboys senior swept three sets to stay perfect in league play at 18-0. \nSaugus 14, Golden Valley 4 \nThe Centurions are hoping Wednesday was a turning point. \nSaugus lost a heartbreaker 9-9 (72-62 in games) to Canyon that day. But the Cents bounced back strong behind a trio of sweeps against the Grizzlies on Thursday at Saugus. \n“Losing to Canyon (Wednesday) really hurt us,” said Saugus head coach Ken Jeffris. “... Yeah that match is definitely the pivotal match in this second round for us.” \nSaugus’ No. 1 doubles team of Megan Cho and Carlie Ozaki swept three sets 6-1, 6-0, 6-0 to improve to 16-2 in Foothill League play on the year. \nSarah Tate and Brianna Achmad took three sets, too. \nAs did singles player Kendyll Burdick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:18:24.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
