(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (Matt Rourke) Comments \nPHILADELPHIA -- When the Eagles signed cornerback Byron Maxwell to a six-year, $63 million deal this past offseason , it was with these kind of games in mind. \nNow, in the Eagles' must-win game this Monday night against the New York Giants at Lincoln Financial Field, it is time for Maxwell to earn his paycheck by covering Pro-Bowl receiver Odell Beckham Jr. \nA challenge he said Wednesday he is not intimidated by. \n\"We don't shy away from nobody,\" Maxwell said. \"I'll play him one-on-one.\" \nIt doesn't sound like Maxwell will be shadowing Beckham, a somewhat surprising decision by defensive coordinator Billy Davis, but chances are he will be matched up with him a fair amount. \nMaxwell has faced Beckham once in his career already, last season when he was still a member of the Seattle Seahawks. On that day, a 38-17 win for the Seahawks, Maxwell wasn't matched up with Beckham, who finished with seven catches for 108 yards. \n\"His run after the catch,\" Maxwell said of what stands out about Beckham. \"He's explosive with the ball in his hands. He's a freaky athlete.\" BRADFORD: Report card from win over Saints \nBeckham's rise to the top of the NFL has been a quick one, and started with his one-handed, falling down catch against the Dallas Cowboys last season. The catch put Beckham on the map, and will certainly be hard to top -- but it wasn't, says Maxwell, a fluke. \n\"He certainly came out here and putting on a show,\" Maxwell said. \"That wasn't just a one time play. He does it over and over again. I like watching it.\" \nWill Eagles' fans be watching Beckham go off Monday night? \nThe last time the Eagles lined up against Beckham he finished with a career-high 185 yards receiving and a touchdown on 12 catches. The big game was one of the reasons the Eagles decided to makeover a secondary that was one of the worst in the league last season. \nOne of those moves was giving Maxwell a whopping $63 million, a contract that at least so far, he has struggled to live up to. \nMORE : Giants' Odell Beckham Jr. optimistic he'll play, per source \nIn five games this season Maxwell has given up 23 receptions for 354 yards and two touchdowns, some of the worst numbers for a cornerback in the NFL. \nThis Monday, Maxwell will get a chance to show in primetime that he can give the Eagles what they paid for, by helping them slowdown Beckham. \n\"I'm excited to be out there on Monday night playing football,\" Maxwell said. \"The names on the jersey don't matter.\" THE NO-HUDDLE SHOW, Ep. 11: Finally, a glimpse of what Eagles fans expected \nThere were plenty of encouraging signs in the Eagles' blowout win over the Saints. From Fletcher Cox's dominance to Josh Huff's emergence, the Eagles showed what they're capable of doing. Now the question is: Can they do it again vs. the Giants?
