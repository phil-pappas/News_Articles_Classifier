(AP) — Missouri's 24-10 victory against South Carolina Saturday marked the first time in the history of the Southeastern Conference that two true freshman quarterbacks started in the same game. \nIn the end, one proved more effective than the other. Twitter Brandon Foster reports Drew Lock's first collegiate start ends with a kneel in victory formation. Mizzou (4-1) defeats South Carolina 24-10. \nFollow News Tribune sports reporter Brandon Foster (@BFoster91) on Twitter for updates during games. \nDrew Lock started at quarterback for Missouri in place of Maty Mauk, who was suspended Tuesday for violating team policies. Lock completed 21 of 28 passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns, helping the Tigers (4-1, 1-1) win their first conference game of the season. He is the first freshman quarterback to start for Missouri since Corby Jones in 1995. \n\"It's a little overwhelming to say the least,\" Lock said of his first start. \"Now that I've started and actually won a game, you can't really put it into words.\" \nThe Tigers gained a season-high 163 rushing yards on 42 attempts. Ish Witter had 17 carries for 98 yards and his first touchdown of the season. Russell Hansbrough had 11 rushes for 43 yards. \nLock said the run game made his first start more manageable. \n\"Hats off to our offensive line and our running backs,\" Lock said. \"They opened up our passing game a ton. They helped me out pretty much the whole game.\" \nLorenzo Nunez threw three interceptions in his second start for the Gamecocks (2-3, 0-3), finishing 15 of 24 for 172 yards and a touchdown. He also led the team in rushing with 15 carries for 60 yards. \n\"We wished he would have thrown those to a little different spot,\" coach Steve Spurrier said of Nunez's interceptions. \"We've got to get the ball to the open guy at the right time. We didn't do that.\" ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:21:52.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
