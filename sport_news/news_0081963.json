Oh, things look the same – traffic still snarls on Garden Valley Boulevard and Loggers still serves the best pizza – but it's the sounds that get them. Ever since that awful morning, when shots rang out at Umpqua Community College, their ears tell them something is off.\nPeople don't speak as much. Or as loudly. Music hasn't played as much, or as loudly. And nobody feels much like laughing.\n\"It's a lot quieter,'' Roseburg High junior Austin Harris said. \"The whole town is just ... different. You can feel it.''\nSo they returned Friday to watch one of the hallmarks of this tight knit logging community: Roseburg High football.\nThe orange and black are not as talented as in years past, when teams in the mid-1990s nearly broke the state record for consecutive wins, but the students, parents, community members and even people who had moved away, showed up Friday.\nThey showed up to end the quiet.\nRoseburg High School students raise money for UCC victims Wanting to do something to help the victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting, a group of Roseburg High School students had t-shirts made that they then distributed in exchange for donations, raising $3000 in two days. Many students and others wore the shirts at Roseburg's first home football game since the tragedy.\nSince the shooting that took nine lives at UCC, the community has been looking for something to rally around. But games at the high school have been canceled. Even the SAT tests at the school were postponed, the idle time a piercing side effect to the confusion in their heads.\n\"This will be big,'' Roseburg junior Cooper Lee said. \"Everyone needs each other right now.''\nGathered in the parking lot of Roseburg High, Lee, Harris and about 40 other students tailgated. They weren't much concerned whether Roseburg could take South Medford. They were more concerned about finally making some noise, figuratively and literally.\nBefore them, a green bucket was feathered with dollar bills. Some were $1. Some were $5. Others were $20. They were donations dropped into the bucket by fans.\nLed by student body president Carson Murphy, the group raised $3,000 in two days after the shooting. They used the money to buy 500 T-shirts in the Kelly Green colors of UCC. The shirts – the state of Oregon with UCC in block letters and a heart signifying Roseburg – were passed out to fans with the option to give a donation. Those donations would be passed on to the victims' families.\nAfter another bill silently fell into the bucket, Murphy celebrated by grabbing the nob on his orange music box and giving it a hard right turn. Country music blared.\nNo more quiet.\n**\nLegendary football coach Thurman Bell, who is in his 45 th and final year at Roseburg, could sense the importance of this game, so he did something he hasn't done this season: he moved his team's locker room.\nUsually, Roseburg dresses in a makeshift locker room inside the industrial building, particle board strung together to form a room inside a larger room.\nBut Friday, he moved them over one building to the gym, where the team dressed in a more traditional locker room.\nHe is the winningest big-school coach in Oregon history, and Bell notched those victories knowing a thing or two about motivating kids. Even at 72, Bell hasn't lost his touch.\nAfter going over some plays, his voice begins to crescendo. Kids sense an uptick in intensity and begin to shift on their seats.\n\"Men,'' Bell says. \"I'm tired of all the talk. There's been a lot of issues we've had to deal with, a lot of issues our community has had to deal with. Those people out there came here to have fun and forget. They want something positive. That's our job!''\nHe is pacing, pointing, and veins in his neck are bulging.\n\"You don't get another chance. We have to get that crowd into it, and the way we do that is being like a family. We have to do everything together!'' Bell screamed. \"I want you to come back in here and look in that mirror and say you gave everything. Now go get it!''\nThen he revealed why they were in a new locker room. He wanted to implement one of his old tricks, one he used to use when the dressing room was under the Finlay Field stands: sitting in complete darkness before running onto the field.\nThey gathered and prayed, asking for strength to play for the UCC victims and their families, and then Bell slapped the lights.\nComplete darkness.\nComplete silence.\n**\nSometimes, the quiet around Roseburg has been empowering, uplifting.\nLifelong Roseburg resident Rachelle Carter, who paced the sideline as she worked as a sideline reporter for radio station 1490 The Score, said the Roseburg that has emerged this week touches her.\n\"I've never seen what I've seen this last week as far as a community coming together and doing things for each other,'' said Carter, a 1989 Roseburg High graduate. \"Never seen an outpouring like this, and I've lived here my whole life.''\nShe was at Starbucks to get coffee and when she reached the register, the barista told her the person in front of her bought her coffee.\n\"I was blown away,'' Carter said. \"But now I've been hearing Starbucks, Java Run, Dutch Bros., people are doing it all over. It's a feel-good thing.''\nMayor Larry Rich, who is also the high school assistant principal, said a teacher came in saying the same experience happened to her at a coffee shop.\n\"It's amazing, but it doesn't surprise me,'' Rich said. \"This is a wonderful, small community that takes care of each other.''\nCarter said there is also a silent donor in town who has hired someone to patrol grocery stores. At a market in nearby Oakland, a cashier finished scanning the contents of a customers' cart then handed the customer a note saying the groceries were paid for.\nAt the bottom of the note, in block letters: UCC STRONG.\n\"Nobody knows who it is, but we hear of it happening,\" Carter said. \"I can't even keep up with all the stories now. But that's who we are: We are real tight and we want the victims, the families of the victims and the people affected by the shooting to know we have their backs.''\n**\nFriday didn't have a happy ending at Roseburg.\nSouth Medford forced a fumble on the first play of the game inside Roseburg's 20, and went on to win 42-13. It might have been a long night, but it was an important one.\n\"This brought us back to some normalcy,'' said Rich, the mayor. \"It was nice to be doing something else instead of focusing on what happened in the tragedy.''\nBefore the game, each team walked to midfield and shook hands before a moment of silence. Then, members of the Roseburg team held cards toward the grandstands with the names of the victims etched in red. Three of the victims were Roseburg graduates.\n\"It's been hard, and the community still hurts,'' athletic director Russ Bolin said. \"It's going to take a while to recover, but this game, this place is somewhere the community can come and start that healing process.''\n-- Jason Quick | jquick@oregonian.com | @jwquick", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jwquick"], "published": "2015-10-10T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:15:59.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
