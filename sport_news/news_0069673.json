Ayers has missed the last four games, while Kennard has missed the last two. \nKennard is second on the team in quarterback hits with four, despite only playing four games. Ayers has a sack and three quarterback hits in his two games. The Giants have only eight sacks and 30 quarterback hits as a team. \nPLUS : 4 downs with Giants tight end Will Tye, the Stony Brook Sensation \n\"Hopefully that part of the game will be better,\" coach Tom Coughlin said. \"Obviously Dallas has an outstanding offensive line, and so on and so forth. But we would have some people that have demonstrated to at least make the quarterback uncomfortable.\" \nThe Giants did not have any success unsettling Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo in their 27-26 loss to Dallas in Week 1. Romo was hit just three times, and the Giants managed no sacks. Romo completed 80 percent of his passes in that game, and was 11-of-12 for 148 yards and two touchdowns on the Cowboys' final two drives of the game as they overcame a 10-point deficit. \nBut, Romo will not be under center for Dallas on Sunday. Matt Cassel will. And Kennard said the Giants' goal is to make his day much more difficult than Romo's was. \n\" I just want to be out there with my teammates ,\" Kennard said. \"I think [the pass rush] is a point of emphasis, just for our own pride. We didn't get enough pressure on the quarterback the last time around, and that's definitely something we want to improve.\" TALK IS CHEAP, Ep. 28: Sloppy Giants got what they deserved vs. Eagles We knew it was going to be a tough spot for the Giants, but after the ugly 27-7 loss in Philadelphia, some may be wondering: Is this déjà vu all over again?
