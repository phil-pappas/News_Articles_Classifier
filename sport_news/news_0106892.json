(AP) — Notre Dame guard Alex Bars is out for the season after fracturing his left ankle against Southern California. \nCoach Brian Kelly said during a conference call Sunday the 6-foot-6, 320-pound sophomore will have surgery. Bars was hurt midway through the second quarter. USC defensive tackle Delvon Simmons was blocked into Bars’ leg during a 26-yard run by Josh Adams. \nBars, a left guard, was making his second start because Quenton Nelson sprained his ankle during a loss at No. 6 Clemson on Oct. 3. Nelson replaced Bars on Saturday. \nThe No. 11 Irish (6-1) are off this week and play at No. 22 Temple (6-0) on Oct. 31.
