Chris Perkins Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel Once again, the Dolphins are 1-2 as they head overseas. Can they get another big win in London? \nThe Dolphins were in this situation last year â€” a 1-2 record, riding back-to-back losses, and heading over to London with controversy swirling. \n\"It looks like history is trying to repeat itself,\" strong safety Reshad Jones said Wednesday. \nThe Dolphins actually hope that's the case. \nLast season the controversy was coach Joe Philbin admittedly fumbling on the question of whether quarterback Ryan Tannehill would remain his starter heading into the Week 4 game at Wembley Stadium. \nThe Dolphins came out of London with a 38-14 rout over the Oakland Raiders, righting the ship heading into their bye week. \nThis season's controversy centers on the shockingly poor three-game performance of the Dolphins, which has led to questions about whether Philbin can weather the storm. Who's responsible for Dolphins' struggles? \nX's and Omar: Sun-Sentinel's Omar Kelly and CBS 12's Matt Lincoln discuss who is most to blame for the Dolphins' early-season struggles. \nX's and Omar: Sun-Sentinel's Omar Kelly and CBS 12's Matt Lincoln discuss who is most to blame for the Dolphins' early-season struggles. See more videos \nAs he tries to, Philbin will be facing a coaching staff that's quite familiar with his team. \nFirst-year New York Jets head coach Todd Bowles and defensive coordinator Kacy Rodgers are former Dolphins coaches. Bowles coached the Dolphins' secondary from 2008-2011 and was the interim head coach for three games after Tony Sparano's firing. Rodgers, a defensive line coach for the Dolphins, was one of the top assistants on Philbin's staff for the past three years. \n\"Coach Rodgers practiced against us every day last year,\" Tannehill said. \"But at the end of the day who we are is shown on tape also, so it's not a great advantage, I wouldn't say, in that aspect.\" Ndamukong Suh; Game against Jets in London critical \nMiami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh talks about the game against the Jets. \nMiami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh talks about the game against the Jets. See more videos \nAny edge could be the decisive factor in this pivotal early-season AFC East matchup. The Dolphins and Jets have split their six matchups over the past three years, with the road team winning every game. \nThe Jets' defense will present a challenge for the Dolphins' struggling offense, as Rodgers' group is ranked fourth in the NFL, allowing just 298.3 yards per game. \nBut Dolphins right tackle Ja'Wuan James agrees with his quarterback that any advantage derived from a coordinator facing his former team might be overblown. \n\"Players play the game,\" James said. \"The coaches, they can put us out there and put us in what they might think can be right, but at the end of the day it's going to be our job to go out there and finish it.\" \nAs for getting their defensive line going, there's a chance the Dolphins could move tackle Ndamukong Suh around. He's usually been planted on the left side, beside end Cameron Wake, but the Dolphins moved Suh in the Jacksonville game and he seemed open to doing it again. \n\"I've always prided myself on being able to play all four positions on the defensive line,\" he said. \"I want to be able to understand them, and at the same time be able to execute and be productive from all of them.\" \nAsked if he thought moving would help, Suh, who has seven tackles and no sacks this season, deflected. \n\"Where ever I'm at on the field, I'm fine with making plays,\" he said. \"Wherever I'm slotted ... I'm happy with where I'm at. [I] go from there and make plays.\" \nThe Dolphins say they understand the significance importance of Sunday's game, and yes, they're hoping history repeats. \n\"It's the same situation,\" said left tackle Branden Albert, who showed enough progress from the left hamstring injury that kept him out of last week's 41-14 loss to Buffalo that he returned to practice on a limited basis Wednesday. \n\"But it's a different game, different team. We've got to get it done like we did last year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:57:45.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
