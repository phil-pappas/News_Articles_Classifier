They're in a stretch that features four of six games on the road. \nDon't expect any sympathy from BYU (2-2), which has played at Nebraska (33-28 win), at nationally ranked UCLA (24-23 loss) and at Michigan (31-0 loss last week). The Cougars beat Boise State (35-24) in their only home game. \n\"I don't know how useful that tape is,\" Diaco said of the Michigan game. \"They're a great team. No one has done what BYU has done, no one in the country. ... I mean they are on the road in Nebraska, UCLA and Michigan and then played their rival. Who's done that in the first four weeks? \n\"To think they let the rope slip out of their hand a little bit ... in Michigan somewhere, it's not shocking to me. They've been awesome.\" \nThe Cougars returned home from Michigan determined to get back on track. \n\"We're not down,\" BYU senior Graham Rowley said on the school's website. \"That's what Connecticut wants us to be, because then they can take advantage, but we're in the fight. ... We have that bitter taste in our mouth that we want to get out.\" \nThis is the second game in the series that started last season when UConn dropped a 35-10 decision in East Hartford. \n\"I think it's going to be a great game,\" UConn redshirt junior Andreas Knappe said. \"Obviously, we might be able to learn some things from last year's game.\" \nIf the Huskies have an advantage, it's that they're healthier than the Cougars, who lost starting quarterback Taysom Hill for the season in their first game and may be without leading rusher Adam Hine, who left the Michigan game with an ankle injury, tonight. \nFreshman Tanner Mangum has passed for 719 yards and four touchdowns but has thrown three interceptions. \nThe Cougars operate what Diaco calls a run spread offense behind a big, physical and experienced offensive line. They're efficient, too, scoring on all nine trips inside a foe's 20-yard line this season. \nThere's also good size on a tough defensive front. Junior defensive back Kai Nacua has four interceptions, tying for the best mark in the country. \n\"They wear you out,\" Diaco said. \"Thinking back to (last year's) game, that's what I remember, that they were a physical imposing group in all three phases.\" \nUConn already has proven it won't be intimidated playing a strong opponent on the road, pushing Missouri to the limit before losing 9-6 on Sept. 19. \ng.keefe@theday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:30:58.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
