His experience over the three round sprint format makes him a genuine danger to his more experienced boxing opponents. \nFalekaono, also 24, possesses an unorthodox switch-hitting style, capable of upsetting his more orthodox opponents. The powerfully built Tongan trains with rising Kiwi heavyweight Hemi Ahio and Monty Betham under well-known coach Lolo Heimuli and will be extremely well prepared. \nA potential clash between Berridge, who has dominated the light heavyweight division across Asia Pacific, and Papuni, who has designs on taking over the mantle as New Zealand's top dog in the division, could produce fireworks. \n\"I don't believe Berridge is above me in skill or power and it's a fight the public wants to see,\" Papuni said. \"I hope we meet in the final and make it a spectacle.\" \nBut Berridge is backing himself and readying for a change in style from a 10 round duration, to the sprint format Super 8 demands. \n\"You've got to get in early and inflict damage from the opening bell,\" he said. \"It's going to be a tough challenge, but I fancy my chances and if it's Papuni in the final - all the better.\" \nThe November 3 card will also feature a New Zealand cruiserweight title bout from Monty Betham against belt holder James Langton, while Ahio will face American Samoa's Alapati A'asa for the New Zealand heavyweight title. \nAustralian league hardman Paul Gallen is set to square off against Warriors forward Bodene Thompson in the fourth professional bout for the New South Wales State of Origin captain. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:35:54.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
