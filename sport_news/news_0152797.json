(AP) -- Former Michigan football player Logan Tuley-Tillman was charged with three felonies Wednesday, nearly a month after the junior offensive tackle was kicked off the team by coach Jim Harbaugh. \nTuley-Tillman stood silent as he was arraigned on one count of using a computer to commit a crime and two counts of capturing/distributing an image of an unclothed person, according to Ann Arbor District Court records. He potentially faces up to 10 years in prison and up to a $5,000 fine for the charge of using a computer to commit a crime. He could be sentenced to up to two years in jail and as much as $2,000 for each of the counts of capturing/distributing an image of an unclothed person. \nHarbaugh, who is coaching the 18th-ranked Wolverines , removed Tuley-Tillman from the team on Sept. 10, because of \"conduct unacceptable for a Michigan student-athlete.\" \nTuley-Tillman, who was a highly touted player from Peoria, Illinois, played Sept. 3 in Michigan's season-opening loss at Utah. The next day, he is alleged to have committed the crimes. He is free on a $5,000 personal bond and is scheduled for a preliminary examination Nov. 12, a week after a probable-cause conference. \nMessages seeking comment were left with Tuley-Tillman, his attorney and Ann Arbor Police. Washtenaw County Chief Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Steve Hiller declined comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:58:23.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
