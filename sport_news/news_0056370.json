Bringing together community religious leaders from Second Baptist Church of Elgin, Cornerstone United Methodist Church in Elgin, Congregation Kneseth Israel, Baitul Ilm Mosque, the Lao American Association of Illinois, and Wat Lao Buddha Samaggi to work on Habitat's ongoing project in Elgin's Historic Watch District. Volunteers will assist in a variety of tasks including painting, carpentry and siding projects. \"At Habitat, we are very deliberate and excited about promoting interfaith engagement,\" said Jonathan Reckford, CEO of Habitat for Humanity International. \"Almost all faith groups have a strong call to care for the poor and have long held traditions of providing shelter as a means of helping families move out of poverty. â€¦ Habitat's Interfaith Build provides faith communities with an opportunity to unite and serve in their communities.\" \"Our goal for the Interfaith Build Day was to create an opportunity for diverse congregations to work alongside one another without giving up a single bit of their theology and to focus on similarities in our beliefs such as a common call to serve those in need,\" said Barbara Beckman, executive director of Habitat for Humanity of Northern Fox Valley. \"We are grateful to the congregations that are participating.\" Habitat for Humanity of Northern Fox Valley is one of eight Habitat affiliates in the Chicago area.
