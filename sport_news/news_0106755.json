Unfortunately, that will have to wait till next month. I have something more vital and interesting to tell you about today. As you may recall, Walla Walla Gun Club (WWGC) received a $150,000 grant last year from the State of Washington to build a new indoor pistol and rimfire rifle range. The club has been diligently planning what they can plan for, and trying to find additional financing to complete the project, but there is only one little hitch — as of this writing the club has no place to build the range. This story may sound like “deja vu all over again” to readers following the club’s melancholy saga. You may also remember that the club’s current shooting grounds, located on Port of Walla Walla property on Middle Waitsburg Road, were the intended site for this range. Up until just a few months ago, negotiations between the Port and WWGC were continuing. However, the Port and the club came to an impasse because of environmental requirements which the Port imposed. That’s the bad news. The good news is that there may be an even better solution to the problem on the near horizon, but some important pieces have to fall into place before the solution can become reality. Earlier this summer, the club received word from certain City of Walla Walla officials that they might be willing to look again at the possibility of finding a new home for WWGC at the Walla Walla City Landfill out on Sudbury Road. Two years ago, there was an abortive attempt to relocate WWGC to the landfill, only to be halted abruptly when the city discovered that their contractor was using that same ground to land-apply solid waste from the city’s sewage treatment plant. Since that time, the city has been working on a comprehensive management plan for the land-application ground. That report is due to be handed up the chain of command sometime around the end of October or early November. Once that report is reviewed and digested, WWGC has been told by the powers that be at City Hall that they will determine whether sufficient unused land exists at the landfill to allow location of the club’s shooting grounds, to include its new indoor range. A lot rides on that determination. For example, WWGC has been working diligently with local financiers and granting agencies in preparation for building the new indoor range. For instance, Sherwood Trust has been asked to consider a grant of $175,000 to augment the state grant, and quite a few other local businesses and agencies have pledged financial and in-kind support. But all of this encouragement depends entirely upon WWGC finding a suitable place to build the range and relocate existing operations. Should the city staff give their okay to the project, then the issue devolves from the realm of the professionals to the much murkier purview of city politics. Once a plausible plan is devised, it will be submitted to the City Council for its approval. Politics being what they are, agreement at that level is not guaranteed. When the City Council is handed the project for review, it will be essential for all parties and people in this area who have been so supportive of the new range to come forward, make their views known to City Council members, and support this project with all their hearts and minds. A great many friends of this project exist out there, quite a few with power and influence. But there will be detractors as well, you can bet on it. It will be up to us all to come to the City Council meetings, write emails and letters of support to City Council members, and do all in our power to promote this worthy public safety project so that an indoor pistol and rimfire rifle range may, at long last, become a reality here in Walla Walla Valley.
