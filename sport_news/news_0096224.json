Walton is one of seven Cobb County teams still playing for a shot at a state title. Area 5 sent five teams into the Class state tournament and four of them — Walton, Lassiter, Pope and their Cherokee County rival Etowah — won first-round matches.The second round of the state tournament, which begins on Tuesday, could present challenges for all.After Pope survived a five-set marathon on the road over Grayson that ended with a 17-15 fifth set, the Lady Greyhounds will travel to Area 6 champion South Forsyth.Both Walton and Lassiter cruised through their first round matches against Archer and Dacula, respectively. However, both will be tested by their second round opponents.The Lady Trojans (29-8) will head to Area 4 champion Harrison (30-9), which came back from a set down to beat Alpharetta in the first round. Walton, which claimed the Area 5 title, will host Johns Creek.Etowah, the fifth seed out of Area 5 , will travel to Area 6 runner-up Lambert.The Lassiter-Harrison matchup is expected to be a battle between two of the top teams in Cobb County, Lassiter coach Greg Hodge said.While Lassiter’s strength is its versatility — Libby Bohniak, Ella Muetterties and Micah Ensor can all attack on front row — Harrison has had success on the back row behind Cam Bihary.The Lady Trojans know they also will have to pinpoint Harrison hitter Katie Doering.“From what I’ve seen, they are a sound defensive team who can pass well,” Hodge said. “While Harrison is not necessarily a tall team, Katie Doering plays super tall.”Area 6 favorite Johns Creek stumbled in the area tournament and fell to the No. 3 seed, putting itself in the same portion of the bracket with top-ranked Walton and defending state champion North Cobb. While Walton (33-4) is the higher seed in the second round, the Lady Gladiators have the serving and hitting that can give the Lady Raiders trouble.Walton libero Celeste Fitzgerald and setter Dalaney Hans both have postseason experience, but Walton’s success could come down to its freshman starters who are making their inaugural run.The Lady Raiders just want to play their aggressive game.“While it may be premature, we are seeing Johns Creek early, and we’re going to take on each point and not look too far ahead of ourselves,” Walton coach Suzanne Fitzgerald said. “It’s all about protecting our house.”Pope (20-21) raised its level of play in the Area 5 tournament, beating Etowah in straight sets to qualify for the postseason and outlasting Grayson in the first round. To put itself in position to win over South Forsyth, the Lady Greyhounds will have to set the tone defensively behind specialists Molly Armitage and Samantha Walters.“If our defense can help us transition into our offensive swing, we can have success,” Pope coach Bryan Jones said.Allatoona (33-17) will welcome McIntosh in the second round of the Class state tournament after beating Kell in straight sets. Coach Joe Soley plans to get his middles Jedaiah Daniels and Jaslynn Gwyn involved.In other second round matches, Campbell, the No. 3 seed out of Region 3 , will host Peachtree Ridge in the second round after sweeping Lovejoy on the road last Thursday.Area 5A champion Mount Paran will host Savannah Christian after opening with a win over Tullulah Falls.
