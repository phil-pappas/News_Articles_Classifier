Al Weis is hiding in that pile of names. So is Jerry Koosman.\nSomewhere, hiding in plain sight, is Lenny Dykstra, and Kid Carter, and Keith Hernandez. Sid Fernandez is loitering in there somewhere. So is Ray Knight.\nSomewhere in the batting order, somewhere in the bullpen, Todd Pratt is preparing for a most unpredictable time at the plate. Benny Agbayani is gripping a bat, waiting to have at a hanging curveball. Bobby Jones is getting loose, ready to pitch the game of his life.\nSomewhere lies the hero of this October version of the Mets. He can be an obvious source: the starting pitcher, Jacob deGrom, or the breakout star, Yoenis Cespedes, or the very face of the franchise, David Wright. Maybe he’s a predictable second-tier choice: Curtis Granderson, Daniel Murphy, Michael Conforto. Or the obvious plot twist waiting to clobber us over the head: Wilmer Flores hitting a two-out, two-strike, ninth-inning grand slam to put Frank Merriwell to shame once and forever.\nOr maybe he is this year’s Weis, this year’s Fernandez, this year’s Pratt/Agbayani/Jones, rising from the anonymous pile to answer October’s bell. Maybe you don’t want to ponder right now the circumstances under which Kirk Nieuwenhuis or Kevin Plawecki or Erik Goeddel might be cast in such a role, but that’s all a part of the torturous wait until 8:07 p.m. Thursday night, too, isn’t it?\n“The thing about this ballclub is that every game we’ve played we’ve expected someone would come through — maybe not always the big names either. This really has been a team where everyone has had their moment to shine.”\nThat was Gil Hodges, speaking after Game 4 of the ’69 World Series, the game Swoboda — and his heretofore iron mitt — rescued with a catch that’s still impossible to believe even after the thousandth viewing. A day later he would watch Weis tie Game 5 with one of only seven home runs he’d hit as a major leaguer.\n“We don’t hand out roster spots on this team as charity. If you’re on this club, it’s because you deserve to be here.”\nThat was Davey Johnson during the ’86 World Series, sometime after he’d seen Dykstra win a game against the Astros in the NLCS with a walk-off home run, sometime before he would see Knight give the Mets a lead in Game 7 of the World Series with a blast, Dykstra and Knight instantly planting their names forever in the souls and memories of Mets fans, no matter how divergent their paths may have gone these last 29 years.\n“Alls I know is that we have a team that is able to pick each other up. We’ve proven that all season long.”\nThat was Terry Collins a few days ago, in the midst of this NLDS matchup with the Dodgers now tied at 2-2, which will be decided with a do-or-die Game 5 at Dodger Stadium Thursday.\nPerhaps what Mets fans are looking for if they wish to borrow from their past is an old-school Miracle Mets miracle, a ball off the top of the wall, a ground ball through Adrian Gonzalez’s legs, a sign that an obvious higher power is looking out for them. And, no, something out of that catalogue wouldn’t hurt, and the Mets wouldn’t turn away any such blessing.\nBut what’s more useful is to utilize what’s already there: one of the 25, two or three of them, to rise up and seize the moment, to ensure their immortality in the eyes of Mets fans who have some of the longest memories in sports (which, as Timo Perez can tell you, can be both good and bad).\nWe know this for certain: Someone is going to make a huge pitch in a critical spot tonight. Someone is going to crack a game-turning (or game-winning) base hit. Someone is going to make a play with his glove that will leave both teams and both fan bases shaking, one out of wonder and one out of misery.\nNow, if it’s a series of Dodgers who do that? Not even a miracle will stop that, and a long, empty winter will commence at once.\nBut if it’s a series of Mets who take to the moment and win this game and deliver them back home to Citi Field for the NLCS and the destiny-boy Cubs Saturday night? Then you’ll never forget their names. You’ll never forget their heroics. You’ll never forget how they rose in the most critical segment of the season and said, “Follow me, boys.”\nSomewhere, they are lurking amid the 25 names on the roster. Time to find out who wants to be the ones who’ll never have to buy a drink in the boroughs with their own money the rest of their lives.\n  curtis granderson ,  daniel murphy ,  david wright ,  jacob degrom ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  wilmer flores ,  yoenis cespedes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:20:06.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
