Comment By Keith Pearson/Daily News Staff MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA By Keith Pearson/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 10:11 PM Updated at 10:16 PM By Keith Pearson/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 10:11 PM Updated at 10:16 PM WALPOLE â€“ The good news for the Natick High football team is that the rules to make the postseason were changed a couple years ago. The Redhawks still have plenty of season to play for, but Friday night was nothing short of a disaster as Walpole piled up 525 yards of offense and limited Natick to just four first downs in a 42-7 rout at Turco Field. The message after the game from Natick coach Mark Mortarelli was that the team would rebound from the loss. \"We'll bounce back,\" he said as the Redhawks will look to be one of the at-large selection to qualify by points for the upcoming Div. 2 South tournament. Natick (2-4, 1-3 BSC Herget) closes out the regular season in Norwood. Walpole's Lovevindjy Salvant rushed 13 times for 295 yards and four touchdowns of 73, 2, 59 and 74 yards. \"He's one of the best all-around players in Eastern Mass,\" Walpole coach Barry Greener said. It was a particularly important win for the Rebels (4-2, 2-2 BSC Herget) after only getting 65 yards in last week's 7-6 loss at Wellesley. Natick grabbed a 7-0 lead on the opening series as Jared Abbruzzese went in from a yard out on fourth down to finish off a 69-yard drive. He had the big play on the six-play drive, getting 64 yards down the right sideline, but was caught from behind by Salvant at the 4. It only took Walpole three snaps to tie things up as Salvant broke out to the left side for a 73-yard run. Ferry Armand put Walpole in front to stay with a 10-yard run to the left side with 1:12 to play in the first quarter. Walpole extended its lead to 28-7 by halftime on a pair of Salvant TD runs and he finished his day on the first play from scrimmage of the third quarter, going down the sideline in front of the Natick bench for 74 yards and extending the lead to 35-7. Walpole finished off its scoring on a 41-yard pass as Brett Von Klock was left alone and ran under the pass from Charlie Auditore. The Redhawks only had for first downs for the game, the long run by Abbruzzese to set up his TD and then three late in the third quarter, their last complete drive of the game as Walpole had the ball for the bulk of the fourth quarter.
