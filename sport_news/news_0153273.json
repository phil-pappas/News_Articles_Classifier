It felt like playing with house money to win a second in Toronto, in the 14th inning. The Blue Jays averaged 5.6 runs per game at home this year, and Texas held them to seven runs across two games, only five of which were earned. Maybe those big bats of Toronto were going to go cold in the playoffs as big bats have a reputation of doing. As that looked like it may be the case, coming home for two needing just one win to advance was a dream come true. \nAnd then what happened? \nToronto scored 13 runs in two games in Texas, neither of which saw the Rangers in control. On Sunday night, it was a home run from Troy Tulowitzki that put the nail in the coffin, and on Monday, it was an onslaught of three home runs in the first two innings that put the game out of reach. \nBut it wasn't just that the Blue Jays started running into home runs once they got to Arlington, but there was a shift in their entire approach from when the two teams faced each other in Toronto. While the Rangers were watching replays of Prince Fielder falling over the railing on their flight home, the Blue Jays must have been formulating a game plan for how to get the offense back on track. \nThe righty-heavy Toronto offense looked very different in Texas. That may have been because they were facing Martin Perez (whom righties have hit .300/.352/.425 off this year) and Derek Holland (.258/.337/.511 vs righties), but the Blue Jays also stopped beating themselves. \nIn Toronto, the Blue Jays drew three walks across 23 innings of play. In 18 innings in Texas, they drew ten walks. By comparison, the Rangers offense drew seven walks in Toronto, and zero in Texas. \nYovani Gallardo had a successful start because he pitched mostly around the fringes of the strike zone, and the Blue Jays never fully squared him up. On Sunday and Monday, the Blue Jays let the pitches on the edges go by or fouled them off, and barreled anything in the middle of the plate. If Gallardo were to face this more patient version of the Toronto team, I'm not sure he'd make it out of the third inning. \nIt is obvious and not surprising that the Rangers' goal is to work low in the zone to Toronto. Here is Gallardo's strike zone plot from his start: \nGallardo strikezone plot \nAnd here is Martin Perez's: \nPerez strikezone plot (Photo: Brooks Baseball) \nThere is not a lot of difference between where those two worked in the zone. The key difference in outcomes is that the Blue Jays didn't help Perez out at all, working him for nine baserunners in five innings, three of which were on walks. The Blue Jays also fouled off 16 of Perez's 90 pitches, the highest foul ball rate of any starter in this series. \nNext up on the mound for the Rangers in the decisive Game Five is Cole Hamels. In his first start, he allowed six hits and four runs (only two earned) in seven innings, but he didn't walk anyone. Toronto fouled him off 20 times out of his 114 pitches, and yet Hamels kept attacking and didn't issue any free passes. He is a much better pitcher than Perez and Holland, but he is also left-handed, of a similar height, delivery, and repertoire, makes this three games in a row the Blue Jays have faced the same look. \nBaseball is a game of making adjustments. The Rangers went to Toronto and punched them in the mouth by taking two games on their turf, but then the Blue Jays adjusted their approach and punched the Rangers right back. Now the Rangers look like the team on their heels facing elimination. But they too can take advantage of the off day on Tuesday to make their own adjustments. While Perez and Holland didn't show any kind of road map to success, Hamels knows exactly what Toronto is looking to do at the plate right now. And he is the kind of true #1 pitcher who a team wants on the mound to try to disrupt that. \nWhatever happens on Wednesday, there is no shame in the position the Rangers have put themselves in. At the start of the series, Hamels vs. Stroman in a do-or-die game would have been considered a positive outcome, especially considering Shin-Soo Choo, Prince Fielder, Mitch Moreland, and Josh Hamilton are a combined 8-for-58 in the series. \nThese are the two best teams in the American League in the second half of the season. In building a 2-0 advantage, Texas showed what they do best: solid starting pitching, sequential offense, and a shutdown bullpen. And in knotting the series back up at two, the Blue Jays showed what they do best as well: patience at the plate, and punish mistakes. Now these two squads will square off one last time with their season on the line. And it's not about being the best team anymore, on Wednesday all that will matter is being the team that plays the best. \nLet Peter know how you think Game Five will go on Twitter @futuregm .
