(AP Photo/Kathy Willens) more > By SCOTT ORGERA -   \nNEW YORK (AP) - The fans wearing orange shirts in right-center at Citi Field were cheering for injured Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada and jeering the Dodgers’ Chase Utley. \nUtley’s slide into second base broke Tejada’s right leg Saturday night and led to Major League Baseball suspending Utley for two games - held in abeyance pending the appeals process. \nFor Monday night’s game against Los Angeles, the Mets’ first home postseason game in nine years, the group carried hundreds of signs containing Tejada’s face and #WinForRuben. \n“This whole center-field section, it’s called the Big Apple Reserve. We have 860 seats for every playoff game so our group will be out there every day,” Darren Meenan of Douglaston, New York, said before the Mets’ 13-7 win. \nMeenan, 34, founded The 7 Line, an independently owned Mets-based clothing website. \nRich Sidell, a 65-year-old Brooklynite, wore a homemade T-shirt featuring Utley’s face at the center of a bullseye and handed out flyers featuring the same image. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:18:18.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
