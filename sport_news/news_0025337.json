The East is made up of four Class 7A and four Class 6A teams, and Cabot would have victories against the other three 7A opponents if it beats Little Rock Central (2-4, 2-1). \n\"It's a big game,\" Cabot Coach Mike Malham said. \"The 7A opponents that we play are the big ones that have playoff implications.\" \nIt's also homecoming at Cabot, which Malham acknowledged brings distractions. But the Tigers, led by senior running back Richard Hayes, have the Panthers' attention. Hayes has 802 yards and 8 touchdowns on 87 carries. \n\"Central is getting better,\" Malham said. \"They've got some good running backs. They're physical. They like to stick it in there. The defense has a big challenge.\" \nThe Panthers have been led by junior quarterback Jarrod Barnes, who is in his second season as the starter. Barnes, 5-11, 173 pounds, rushed for 220 yards and 3 touchdowns on 19 carries last Friday in Cabot's 49-28 victory at West Memphis. \n\"He's having a fantastic year,\" Malham said of Barnes, who has rushed for 659 yards and 9 touchdowns on 58 carries. \"You can't coach what he can do.\" \nMalham said he's put in the Shotgun offense for Barnes, something he's never done in his 35-year tenure at Cabot. \n\"He's a good athlete,\" Malham said. \"It gives us another wideout. It makes our running game even better.\" \nBarnes has received interest from Arkansas, with Razorbacks tight ends coach Barry Lunney Jr. visiting the school Thursday. He's also received interest from Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas State. \nThe Panthers are 6-0 for the second time in three seasons, and Malham has credited maturity as a big reason for that. He hopes the Panthers can remain healthy and grab a top seed in the Class 7A playoffs. \n\"You have to keep your kids focused,\" Malham said. \"Everybody has good athletes. You have to keep your mind on business. Anybody on any given night can beat you.\" \nBLYTHEVILLE \nBig night for Clark \nJunior running back Demekko Clark one-upped his brother DeMadre. \nDemekko Clark broke his brother's single-game rushing record at Blytheville last Friday night when he rushed for 442 yards and five touchdowns in the Chickasaws' 53-26 5A-East Conference victory over Greene County Tech. \nDeMadre Clark, a senior last season, had 328 yards and 6 touchdowns a year ago against Greene County Tech, but his younger brother was ready to do something special last Friday, Coach Ben Fisher said. \n\"We knew he had something like that in him,\" Fisher said. \"We always knew in the back of our minds he could do something like that.\" \nClark, 5-8, 200 pounds, scored on runs of 23, 74, 49 and 95 yards in the first half and had a 46-yard run in the second half. He has rushed for 995 yards and 11 touchdowns for the Chickasaws (4-2, 2-1 5A-East). \nFisher said Clark had a good week of practice and was focused for Friday's game, but he added that the offensive line was key. \n\"Those guys up front did some dirty work for them,\" Fisher said. \nBlytheville travels to Valley View today. \nBRYANT \nHurt Hornets \nBryant is down to its third-string running back after injuries to its top two backs over the past two weeks. \nJunior DeAmonte Terry, who has rushed for 560 yards on 77 carries, will start tonight for the Hornets (6-0, 3-0 7A/6A-Central) at Greenwood. \nSenior Davonte Turner fractured his lower leg against Russellville on Sept. 25 while junior Cameron Coleman tore a ligament in his tibia and fibula last Friday at Alma. Bryant has lost linebacker Devin Howard to a shoulder injury, so the Hornets are trying to avoid more injuries as they head into the final four games of the regular season. \nDespite the injuries, the Hornets are undefeated in 7A/6A-Central play, escaping with a 27-24 victory at Alma. \n\"They're a resilient bunch,\" Coach Paul Calley said. \"We really haven't played up to our capability yet, but we've found a way to win. Everybody reminds me that's the important thing.\" \nGreenwood (6-0, 3-0) is led by quarterback Luke Hales, who has thrown 15 touchdown passes. \n\"Greenwood is a powerhouse,\" Calley said. \nBryant has two more games left against Class 7A teams -- Van Buren next Friday and Conway on Nov. 6 -- which is Calley's main focus as the Hornets attempt to clinch one of the three 7A playoff spots from the 7A/6A-Central. \n\"We've had a lot of obstacles,\" Calley said. \"The health is the number one concern. We're not very deep. Further injuries can cause more trouble.\" \nSports on 10/16/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:09.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
