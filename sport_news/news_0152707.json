the only major tournament in the nation's football history. \nCharles missed the 1-0 defeat to Brazil after being injured against Hungary in the previous game, but he was sounded out later by a teenage Pele, who had scored the winner, and handed the Brazilian's number 10 shirt. \n\"I was only eight when my grandad passed away so I don't have too many memories,\" Jake Charles said. \n\"But you see some of the footage and how good he was as a footballer and you're proud to call him grandad. \n\"It's a bit of added pressure being a young footballer and people saying, 'That's John Charles' grandson', but the way I look at it is if I'm half as good a player as he was then I'm going to have a good career.\" \nThe 19-year-old Charles made his Huddersfield debut at the end of last season and, having been capped for Wales from U16 to U19 level, won his first U21 cap as a substitute in last month's 3-1 victory in Luxembourg. \nTime might not be on his side to make Chris Coleman's senior squad in time for France should they get there, but Charles says his ambition is to emulate his grandfather John, uncle Mel and cousin Jeremy and play for Wales. \n\"Wales showed an interest in me from a very early age, it was a no-brainer to be involved in international football and I was proud to play for them because of my grandfather,\" he said. \n\"I've seen Under-21 team-mates Harry Wilson and Gethin Jones involved with the seniors and you think to yourself, 'yes, it's a reachable goal'. \n\"The Welsh coaches are always telling you the pathway to the senior squad is there and it's about putting on performances to show you are good enough to make that step.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:49.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
