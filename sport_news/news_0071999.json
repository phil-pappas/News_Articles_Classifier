Lots of German coaches have been successful but not many come here. This is a big challenge for me and my coaching team. \n\"Liverpool have had a period without success and changed managers a lot. Now the hope is for miracles but progress takes time.\" \nKlopp charmed and entertained in his press conference, declaring himself 'the Normal One' after he was asked about Jose Mourinho's quip about being 'a Special One' when he first arrived in England. \nThe German refused to say whether the Chelsea manager had been in touch but insists his remark was far from pre-planned. \n\"No, but I haven't given any thought to such things,\" said Klopp, who revealed despite his good grasp of English he was taking further lessons to ensure he can get his message across to the players. \n\"I was asked about it and it took me off-guard. Sometimes it's better to keep your mouth shut, but in a press conference it's pretty difficult.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:01:02.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
