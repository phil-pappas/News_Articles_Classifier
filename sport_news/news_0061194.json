Both interception were inside the 40. Come up empty, that’s tough.” The Chieftains, running the Wing-T, were able to pound out the victory and send their homecoming crowd home happy. The Trojans only had seven possessions in the contest, scoring on the first one. The rest of the first half saw two interceptions, a turnover on downs, and the final drive ending with the clock running out. Sturgis only had two drives in the second half. The first ended on a missed field goal, the second on a punt. “They got the ball back (early) in the fourth quarter and they had a third-and-24,” Lamb said. “We got a personal foul penalty, they got a first down and finished it out.” Sturgis took the opening drive, overcame a couple of penalties, and scored on a 5-yard run by Tristen Stewart. It capped a 64-yard drive that took nearly seven minutes and after Rodrigo Garcia’s extra point, the Trojans led 7-0. A turnover on downs by Sturgis led to the Chieftains first score. They took over at their own 44-yard line and four plays later scored on a 26-yard run by Ronnie Payne. Dowagiac went for two and converted on a Lazaro Piedra run for a 8-7 edge with 10:45 left before halftime. An interception by the Chieftains late in the quarter led to another score. Starting at the Sturgis 41-yard line, it took Dowagiac five plays to get into the end zone on a 20-yard pass from Anthony Neubauer to Eric Walker. Piedra scored on the two-point conversion again for a 16-7 lead that the Chieftains took to the halftime break. Sturgis will close the home portion of the schedule hosting Plainwell next week.Those Trojans lost to Edwardsburg, 58-19, this week. “We’ve got to prepare for them,”Lamb said. “We’re in a spot where we need to take care of business.” Stewart finished 15-of-29 for 214 yards, he added 50 rushing yards. Cole Campbell toted the ball 19 times for Sturgis for 105 yards. Liam Adams led Sturgis with five passes for 78 yards, Salvador Mangandi had five catches for 35 yards, Brecken Stewart caught three passes for 43 and BrandonWetzel caught a pair for 58 yards. Defensively Sturgis was led by Tyler Cain and Garcia with 7.5 stops each, Adams finished with six while Keylin Marker and Brecken Stewart each tallied five tackles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:36:37.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
