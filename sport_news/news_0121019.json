Shelby Essex, 24:33 Related Media PALISADE — It must have been a strange sensation for Eagle Valley’s cross-country Brandon Sheard on Friday. He was running at Palisade and no one was a around him. That’s because he was winning. Sheard rang up his first career win on Friday and the Devils boys won their first race of the season on Friday, while the ladies finished second at the Palisade. (Let the record note that they recorded a win earlier this season at Hotchkiss.) “He was right out in front from the beginning,” Devils coach Melinda Brandt said. “Some guys put some pressure on him late, but he pulled away nicely.” Meanwhile Avery Doan and Shawna Adams led the ladies to a second-lace finish behind the host Bulldogs. The Palisade Invite also serves as the JV championship race. The Devils won both. This becomes relevant as the Devils will have some competition for spots on the regional teams in two weeks. Thursday’s meet in Rifle will go a long way toward deciding those. “We’re looking at a few spots,” Brandt said. “We’re looking at our younger runners and it will be the last tune-up for regionals. We’re really looking forward to it.” In the meantime, the Hosses for Friday were Isaac Yoder and Claire Kurronen.
