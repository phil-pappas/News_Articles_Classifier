Related Links Balance is key as Coal City rolls onward \nThe three teams who defeated the Coalers are a combined 20-1. \nCoal City’s average margin of victory is 25.5 points; it’s average margin of defeat is 25.0. \nThe Coalers are better than the losing teams on their schedule and out-classed by the powerhouses. \nTo Coalers such as running back Joe Starkey, it’s not that simple. \nHe believes that the Coalers have failed to capitalize on opportunities that could have won the games they lost. \n“I think we’ve gotta finish ballgames,” Starkey said after the Coalers were out-scored 20-0 in the second half of a 34-6 loss to unbeaten Manteno Friday. “We gotta step it up. A lot of times, we just come out flat, and we just gotta fix that. We gotta come out with a head full of steam and make something happen.” \nThe Coalers were not competitive with the Panthers late in Friday’s game, but the stages of the game might have played out differently if the Coalers had capitalized on early chances. \nAfter Manteno drove down the field and scored on the opening drive, the Coalers countered with a 15-play drive that brought Manteno to the 2-yard line. \nOn third-and-goal, quarterback Nick Micetich pitched the ball to Starkey, who couldn’t secure it. Manteno’s Will Smith fell on the fumble. \nManteno ended up punting on the next drive, and a facemask penalty on the Panthers helped the Coalers again drive into Manteno territory. \nAnother Coaler fumble was recovered by Manteno to leave the Coalers without points. \nThe Coalers made a defensive stand with Manteno deep in their territory, however, and managed another drive that ended with a Starkey touchdown. \nAll the Coalers needed was a successful extra point and to hold the Panthers for 2:17 to go into the half with a tie. \nNeither happened. \nThe kick missed and three big pass plays got the Panthers into the end zone in exactly a minute. \n“You get it in the red zone, and there (should be) a score,” Coal City coach Lenny Onsen said, “and then if we play good defense with two minutes to go. … For the most part, we did some things to hang in there, but just not enough to finish. You gotta finish.” \nWith 32 opponents’ wins, the Coalers are unlikely to secure a Class 4A playoff berth if they finish the season at 5-4. \nTo finish 6-3 and ensure they will be playoff-bound, they have to defeat a team who is over .500 – which would be a first for the season. \nThey host Lisle (5-2) next week. Coal City will play Seneca in the final week of the regular season. \n“We’ll need two more wins,” Onsen said, “and we’re gonna coach their tails off all week and get ready for our senior night, and we’ll play well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:46:01.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
