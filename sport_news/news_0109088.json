Fraser agreed to a two-way contract the same day he was released by Toronto, and was eventually sent to Binghamton of the American Hockey League to provide leadership and toughness to the young club. \nAlthough his goal is to play in the NHL, Fraser is happy with the way things turned out. \n“Toronto was a big numbers game, and I wasn’t sure what was going to come out of it,” said Fraser, whose contract pays him $125,000 in the AHL and $800,000 in the NHL. “Ottawa was going to give me a chance to play right away, even if it was the farm club. Just to be back on the ice with pros, it provides a little security in my life.” \nA veteran of 219 regular-season and five playoff games in the NHL, 6-foot-4-inch, 220-pound Fraser has accumulated 23 career points and 309 penalty minutes with New Jersey, Toronto and Edmonton. He has played at least one NHL game in each of the past six seasons. \nLast season, he registered four assists in 34 games with New Jersey, and also a goal and two assists in 18 games with Albany in the AHL. \nFraser now has a chance to work with B-Sens coach Luke Richardson, whose style as a stay-at-home, physical defenseman is similar to Fraser’s. \n“I really look forward to working with a guy like Luke Richardson,” said Fraser, a third-round draft pick by New Jersey in 2005. “It’s always nice having a player’s coach and someone who is not really far removed from the game himself. He really understands some of the pressures we go through down here, and it’s just another opportunity for me to work my way back up and hopefully play for my hometown team.” \nFraser knows what it takes to get to the NHL and will be hoping for a shot if Ottawa is looking to bring in a physical defenseman. He also sees this opportunity with Binghamton as a chance to not only help the team make the playoffs, but also provide leadership and be a good teammate on and off the ice. \n“There’s a lot of growing pains that guys are going to face the first few years in the minors, and I want to be a good veteran presence, the same way I had guys like that when I was a young guy starting out,” he said. “It’s good in a lot of ways because guys are so loose, and they’re not really concerned with some of the pressures that come with the job. At the same time, having a good veteran presence at any level — no matter how young or mature a group might be — can calm things down and provide a stable foundation for young guys that are maybe put in pressure situations they aren’t used to: a long grind of a physical season, a lot of road trips and a lot of hours on the bus. \n“Leading by example, not so much something you have to tell guys, but just being a good example for them.” \nMatt Weinstein covers the Binghamton Senators for the Press & Sun-Bulletin. 1 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1LJdcSF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:57:10.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
