Enlarge Facebook A school resource officer at Spring Valley High School in S.C. is seen on video in a confrontation with a female student who allegedly refused to leave the classroom.\nA South Carolina sheriff's deputy attacked a high school student as classmates watched in horror, shocking footage revealed.\nA video recorded by a student at the Spring Valley High School in Columbia showed a school resource officer asking a student to get out of her seat. He stands over her desk and tells the student, \"either you're coming with me or I'll make you.\" Without giving her time to get up, he grabs her and flips her over, slamming her onto the ground.\nThe school's resource officer then drags her out of her chair and tossed her across the room, as students watched speechlessly. The deputy then pins her down on her stomach as he puts her hands behind her back.\nStudents at the school identified Ben Fields as the officer behind the classroom throwdown. They've also noted that the officer has had a history of roughing up students. Fields is listed on the Richland County sheriff's department's website as a senior deputy assigned to Spring Valley High School. On his now-deleted Twitter page, he described himself as football coach for the school's defensive line, and a strength coach.\nThe Richland County sheriff's department said it's aware of the situation and currently investigating the attack. A lieutenant told the Daily News it was looking into the video before suspending or reprimanding the officer.\nThe student was under arrest for disturbing school and resisting arrest after refusing to leave the class, cops said.\nang@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:28:41.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
