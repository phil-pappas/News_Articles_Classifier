Steve Downie caused Weal's indecision by bodying up on the young center, Connor Murphy held the puck in at the blue line, and Domi grabbed it and launched a blistering shot past Jonathan Quick to make it 3-0. \nDomi, the 12th overall draft pick in 2013, had an assist on Ekman-Larsson's goal. \nDomi became the first player to score multiple points in his debut with the Coyotes franchise since current captain Shane Doan had two assists for the Winnipeg Jets on Oct. 7, 1995, according to Stats LLC. \nTyler Toffoli scored for Los Angeles. \nSince scoring on the first shot of their season, the Kings allowed nine straight goals before Toffoli followed up Jeff Carter's short-handed breakaway miss and put it in the net with 57 seconds left in the second period. The Kings lost their opener 5-1 to San Jose on Wednesday night, and again did little to indicate they were ready to return to the postseason and push for a third Stanley Cup title in five seasons. \nBefore Toffoli's goal, the Staples Center fans did not hide their displeasure, booing and jeering Quick when he touched the puck long before Rieder make it 4-0. Quick finished with 18 saves. \nMichalek scored exactly 2 minutes into the game, his shot deflecting off Nick Shore's stick and fluttering in. \nWhile the Kings dominated long stretches of the first period, the Coyotes doubled their advantage when Ekman-Larsson scored on a one-timer from between the circles with 48 seconds remaining, with Martin Hanzal picking up the first of his two assists. \nNOTES: The Coyotes will play their first home game Saturday night against Pittsburgh before returning to Southern California to face Anaheim on Wednesday night. ... Weal made his NHL debut, playing 7:38. He was the most valuable player of the AHL playoffs last season, scoring 10 goals and adding 12 assists. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:34:32.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
