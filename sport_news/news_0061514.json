The grueling training during the offseason, and running through in-season soreness is all done with an eye on the Western Massachusetts and state championships. \nOn Wednesday during the final regular season race, runners did not hold back and conserve energy. Drury's Connor Meehan continued a stretch of strong races, finishing first in 16 minutes and 15 seconds. Monument's Meryl Phair finished first for the girls in 20:52. \nMeehan said he wants to focus on having an even pace as he prepares for Berkshire County individuals next Saturday. \nAfter running in the front of the pack during the middle portion of the race, his ability to stay at a steady pace allowed him to widen his lead. He finished a minute and nine seconds faster than the next racer. \n\"I was really focused on trying to keep an even pace today,\" Meehan said. \"I've fallen off a little in the middle portion of the race, so I really tried to stay even. I didn't go out as hard, but I had some guys pushing me at the beginning and luckily I was able to pull away.\" Advertisement \nDespite Meehan's first-place finish, Drury did not have enough finishers to score in its dual against Lee and Taconic. Pittsfield earned a 15-48 dual win over Monument, and the Generals squeaked out a 26-29 win over Taconic. Taconic beat Monument 17-38. \nOn the girls side, Monument earned dual victories against Pittsfield and Taconic, winning 18-39 and 20-39, respectively. \nThe girls race was a near photo-finish, as Phair didn't have just anyone pushing her down the stretch, coming in a close second was her sister, Grace. \n\"I could hear her behind me, and I was like 'I've got to run,'\" the elder Phair said. \"It's great to have her [on the team]. She's just a freshman, so I'm expecting big things from our team.\" \nMonument coach Chris Unsworth said the younger Phair has made significate strides throughout the season, and the sibling rivalry brings out the best in both runners. \n\"Grace and Meryl have been at the forefront for us all of the season,\" Unsworth said. \"Grace has edged her way up into that [top] position, and they've been in that position for the last couple weeks. They're both helping each other out, and they're getting stronger and stronger.\" \nMonument put five runners on the top 10. Taconic's Karli Manship was the Braves' top finishers, placing fifth in 21:09. Lessley Columna led Pittsfield, placing sixth in 21:10. \nBrooke Digennaro placed eighth for Drury (21:52), and Ava Martin placed 14th for Lee (23:05). \nThe boys race was close at the top, as Pittsfield placed four runners in the top 10, and Taconic placed three in the top 10, \nThe group of Pittsfield finishers led by Tom Lee (fifth, 17:35), helped the Generals edge out the Braves. It was only Taconic's second loss of the season, allowing Pittsfield to avenge a close loss to its cross-town rival earlier in the season. \n\"Every time you beat someone, they're going to gear up to race you, especially with this being the last race of the year,\" Taconic coach Paul Phelps said. \"It's a tough loss, but I'm proud of the guys. They all ran well.\" \nSam Harding was Lee's top finisher, placing second in 17:24. Mohammed Jadellah led Taconic, placing third in 17:33. Richard Stanmeyer led Monument with an 11th-place finish (17:56). \n———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:54:25.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
