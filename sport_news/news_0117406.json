He just bolted when his teammates were asked who had the messiest locker because, well, he knew. Laughing, his teammates gave their answer during Auburn basketball's Pearl Jam on Thursday night, an event in which the crowd and players got to know one another in Auburn Arena. Coach Bruce Pearl enjoyed the freshman dancing, when teammates thought New Williams considered himself a model, and, of course, the 3-point shooting and the dunk contests. They even gave away jars of Pearl Jam with real jam.\"The chemistry on and off the court is nice,\" Bowers said. Williams brought the crowd to its feet when he won the slam dunk contest with a through-the-legs windmill jam. Williams shrugged it off his warmup dunk, thinking more would be on the way.\"I had some other stuff under my sleeve,\" Williams said. Bowers said Williams indeed has more game.\"It's like he sits down in the air. It's a pause for a minute, then he just dunked it. It was crazy,\" Bowers said.\"I have done stuff like that,\" Williams said. \"It's pretty weird. It's like sometimes I kind of float.\" That was the slam dunk contest. Assistant coach Todd Golden won the 3-point shooting contest, beating all the players and even fellow assistant Chuck Person, the man known as The Rifleman.\"I don't know if it's a good sign if one of my coaches can win the 3-point shooting contest,\" Pearl said. \"Coach Golden still has it. I guess it shows you what a good coaching staff I have when The Rifleman can't win the 3-point shooting contest.\" It was all a warmup, of course, for Auburn's two exhibition games, the first one on Oct. 30, and for the season-opener against UAB on Nov. 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:31:46.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
