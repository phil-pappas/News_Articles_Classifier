He was sacked five times to push his NFL-leading total to 31. \nLynch ran for 122 yards despite vomiting on the sideline in the first half as Seattle (3-4) won its first road game in four tries, avoiding another fourth-quarter collapse. \nIn a game lacking its usual intrigue with both teams trying to save their seasons and with Pete Carroll missing coaching nemesis Jim Harbaugh, Wilson made the key plays and Colin Kaepernick struggled once again facing Seattle.
