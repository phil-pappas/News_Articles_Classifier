You have to gang-tackle him; you have to run through the tackle. You may make contact at two yards, but he’s pulling you for six.”\nHelton said Booker’s talent is undeniable.\n“He is without question the most physical back in our conference and one of the better ones in the country,” he said.\nCOLLEGE GAME TOO LONG?\nThis past weekend’s games led to discussions in the media about whether the contests lasting 3½ to 4 hours were too long, and what, if anything, should be done about it.\nThe Pac-12 coaches didn’t think much of the complaint, and even less of proposed remedies.\n“College football, it seems to me, is more popular than it’s ever been,” said Cal head coach Sonny Dykes. “There are more games on television, more people watching, so it’s hard to make that argument from a fans’ perspective. I think it’s as popular as it’s ever been.”\nWashington State coach Mike Leach agreed.\n“I think the game is just fine,” he said. “I think if they were too long, people wouldn’t be watching. But instead they’re watching at a higher rate than they ever have before. We need to quit tinkering with stuff and take satisfaction with the fact that we have a great product.”\nStanford head coach David Shaw said he doesn’t think the games are too long, but if they are, it’s not the fault of players and coaches.\n“I think there are more and more longer commercial breaks,” he said. “College football is exciting. For the people who love it, they’re not going to worry about how long it is.”\nHe would however welcome fewer late night games.\n“I don’t think it’s a disadvantage, but I would say it’s not ideal,” he said. “When you’re playing at night, everybody gets to watch you, but those East Coast eyes, they go to bed. And it’s difficult especially when you’re on the road and you don’t get home until 3 o’clock in the morning.”\nUTAH A SURPRISE? NOT TO PAC-12 COACHE S\nWhen asked if anything in Pac-12 play surprised him, David Shaw said not really.\n“I don’t think there is a complete surprise in our league,” he said. “Maybe more than us, I would say the fact that Utah has won as big as they’ve won. But I don’t think anybody who's watched this team grow in the last few years is surprised they’re undefeated.”\nArizona head coach Rich Rodriguez echoed those sentiments.\n“They’ve obviously done a great job (this year),” Rodriguez said of Utah. “I thought they did a great job even before they entered the Pac-12.”\nEmail: adonaldson@deseretnews.com\nTwitter: adonsports", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:31:38.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
