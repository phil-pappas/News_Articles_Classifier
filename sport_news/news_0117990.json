Officials canceled Friday afternoon's practice and allowed the drivers to use only full wet tires Saturday morning. \nWith cars sliding and spinning through turns, Hamilton was well back before running through a lap of 1 minute, 59.517 seconds to take the top spot from Sahara Force India's Nico Hulkenberg. \nMore heavy rain was expected, raising questions about afternoon qualifying. \nRace officials didn't immediately announce plans for qualifying. If officials decided to use practice times, Hamilton would earn pole position for Sunday's race as he seeks to win his second consecutive world title and third overall. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:33:53.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
