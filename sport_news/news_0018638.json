President’s rule must be imposed in Punjab,” Ahmed said.\nAsking Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and DGP S.S. Saini to take the responsibility of the incident, he said the episode could have been avoided had they acted in time and solved the case of the missing scripture.\n“Everybody has a right to protest and it can be done peacefully,” Bajwa said while terming the police action as “insensitive and miscalculated”.\n“Sukhbir, as the Home Minister, must own the moral responsibility and quit,” he said in a statement.\nSuspecting that Akali leaders ordered police to open fire on protesters, Bajwa said the administration must disclose who directed security personnel to take action against agitators.\nEarly this week, two persons were killed and 75 injured in clashes between activists of Sikh outfits and police over the alleged sacrilege of holy book Guru Granth Sahib at Butter Kana village in Moga district, Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in Faridkot district.\nPolice had booked about 500 people under various sections of the IPC in connection with the clashes.\nThe Deputy CM earlier today directed the police to withdraw all cases registered against protesters. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:43:06.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
