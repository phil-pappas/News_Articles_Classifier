Familiar issues haunt 'Canes in loss to Cincinnati \nEven through their first three games – all wins – the Hurricanes have been vulnerable. \nThey’ve been penalized. They’ve struggled on third down. They’ve settled for field goals in the red zone. \nThursday in Cincinnati, all of those issues reappeared. And this time, Miami couldn’t overcome them. \nInstead, the Bearcats capitalized on all of the Hurricanes woes en route to a 34-23 upset win over Miami. It was Cincinnati’s first win over the Hurricanes since their first meeting in 1947, snapping a streak of 11 straight losses to Miami. \nWorse for the Hurricanes, it was Miami’s seventh double-digit loss in 18 games, dating back to Miami’s 36-9 loss to Louisville in the 2013 Russell Athletic Bowl. \nSince then, there have been losses at Louisville, Nebraska, Georgia Tech and Virginia that have added to the Hurricanes’ recent misery. \nCheck out the images from the Hurricanes-Bearcats game. \nAnd many of those featured the same problems that haunted Miami on Thursday when the Hurricanes went 4 of 15 on third down and were penalized six times for 50 yards. \n“Costly penalties, drive killers, obviously the Corn Elder [punt return touchdown negated by a penalty] put us in a bad situation a couple times,” Miami coach Al Golden said. “We didn’t convert enough in the red zone. I thought the defense really settled down nicely in the second half, but we ended up giving up two [explosive] plays that were costly, untimely there.” \nDespite all that, Miami had opportunities late, though Cincinnati’s redshirt freshman Hayden Moore made it difficult throughout the night, and especially late. \nMoore, making his first college start, was 22 of 33 for 279 yards with two touchdowns, including a 7-yarder to Tyler Cogswell with 6:54 left that essentially put the game out of reach for Miami, which now limps into ACC play and an Oct. 10 matchup with Florida State after its first loss of the year. \nEntering Thursday’s game, the expectation was that it had the potential to be a wild, back-and-forth affair showcasing to strong-armed quarterbacks and a pair of effective offenses. \nAnd for much of the first half, that’s how it played out, though Miami (4-1) weathered a brutal start before regaining its footing and getting back into the game before it got dangerously out of reach. \nIn the first quarter, the Hurricanes were 2 of 5 on third down conversions and saw a promising opening drive sputter after a holding penalty negated a big gain and pushed Miami out of the red zone. \nThat forced Miami to settle for a 41-yard field goal from Michael Badgley, and Cincinnati – with its high-powered offense—took advantage to build a quick 14-3 lead. \nAnd the Bearcats’ first touchdown came in pretty embarrassing fashion for the Miami defense, which seemed to have Hosey Williams wrapped up for a loss. But Williams kept his feet moving, and got out of the grasp of Rayshawn Jenkins, scampering through the mass of bodies to score on a 29-yard run that sent the record Nippert Stadium of 40,101 crowd into a frenzy and put Miami in a deficit for the first time this season. \n“You know, I had him. He fell in the pile. I was waiting for a whistle and he popped back up off the pile and started running again,” Jenkins said. “That’s clearly my fault because I have to make sure he’s down on the ground all the way. At the end of the day, we can’t have those mistakes.” \nCincinnati built on its lead on its next possession after Shaquille Washington’s 69-yard punt return put the Bearcats inside the Miami 11-yard line. One play later, Moore connected with receiver Mekale McKay for 11 yards to give Cincinnati an 11-point cushion. \nMiami answered with a 12-play, 45-yard drive that resulted in points, but again, it wasn’t the touchdown the Hurricanes so desperately wanted. There was yet another penalty, this one a false start, and four plays later, Badgley connected on his second field goal of the night, this one a 47-yarder that improved the sophomore to a perfect 9 of 9 on kicks between 41 and 49 yards. \nIt was after that point – with 3:39 left in the quarter – that Miami seemed to turn the corner. \nJenkins picked off Moore inside Cincinnati (3-2) territory and a play later, Miami used a flea-flicker to set up a 6-yard touchdown run by Mark Walton that pulled Miami within 14-13 after the extra point. \nMiami regained the lead early in the second quarter after Joe Yearby scored on an 8-yard run that gave the Hurricanes a 20-17 lead with 11:26 left in the half. But in the quarter, Moore and the Bearcats capitalized on the fact the Hurricanes were without safeties Deon Bush and Jamal Carter – suspended for the first half after being whistled for targeting penalties against Nebraska. \nMoore, who threw for a school record 557 yards in three quarters against Memphis, engineered a pair of scoring drives in the second quarter that gave the Bearcats a 27-20 halftime lead. \nNeither team scored in the third quarter, and Miami pulled within 27-23 after Badgley’s third field goal of the night – a 26-yarder with 8:59 left –but the Hurricanes couldn’t muster anything consistent on offense after that. \nccabrera@tribpub.com ; On Twitter @ChristyChirinos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:36:38.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
