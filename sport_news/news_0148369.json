Well today it was 'Get your Licks on Route 66.\nA special pet adoption day at Golden Paw Animal Rescue featured a stop by the owner of Fido Friendly magazine. The owner shares proceeds of his events with rescue shelters and visitors could spin a wheel for prizes.\n It's the seventh annual Licks on 66 tour which goes from Los Angeles to Chicago.\n The magazine, Fido Friendly, that was started fifteen years ago stemmed from owner, Greg Sims having a hard time finding place that would accept pets. Now more than four hundred hotels take his magazine as a pet package amenity.\n But Sims says it's the tour's attention to adoption that's important. Sims says, \"We feel like we're making a difference.\nAll of us have within us the ability to make a difference in this world. This is something we do.\n Hopefully we're making a difference. We've placed over three thousand animals in the first six years.\"\n Visitors could adopt certain animals for a special price.\n There are at least seventy dogs and sixteen cats at the animal rescue on North Main in Joplin.\n The Get Your Licks on Route 66 tour stops next in St. Louis on Sunday at the Canine Carnival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:12:05.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
