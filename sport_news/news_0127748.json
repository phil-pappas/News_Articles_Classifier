Seattle announced the changes in status following the team's walkthrough practice on Sunday. Lynch and Mebane had both been listed as questionable after Saturday's final practice. Lynch injured his hamstring late in the first half of Seattle's 26-0 win over Chicago last Sunday. Lynch was hurt catching a fourth-down pass just before halftime. Seattle coach Pete Carroll said Lynch had an MRI on the injury earlier this week and the scan showed some \"findings\" but did not elaborate. It will be just the second game Lynch has missed since joining the Seahawks in 2010 and the first since the 2011 season. Rookie Thomas Rawls, who rushed for 104 yards last week in Lynch's absence, will likely get the start against the Lions. Mebane suffered a groin injury against the Bears and did not practice all week. Seattle also added linebacker Bruce Irvin to the injury report with an ankle injury. He is questionable.
