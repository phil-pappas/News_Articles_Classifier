The company didn't return requests seeking comment Tuesday.\nThe company was founded three years ago and is part of Oregon's latest boutique alcohol craze .\nLeinweber's suit says he was working a \"product booth\" when a customer approached and told him that a bottle of Atlas cider had exploded in his cellar. The customer exchanged a bottle that was leaking -- and an hour or two later, that bottle exploded, the suit states.\nLeinweber suffered four cuts to his legs and received 11 sutures, his suit states. One of the cuts later became infected, and he sought additional care, including antibiotic treatment, according to the suit.\nThe cider became unstable after certain batches experienced \"a secondary fermentation ... within the bottle causing the development of dangerous and excess pressures,\" the suit alleges.\nIn August, Ohio-based hard cider maker Angry Orchard recalled some of its product after similar reports of bursting bottles caused by re-fermentation.\nLeinweber is seeking $2,033 in medical expenses and $7,966 for pain and suffering. His suit, however, states he might seek up to $75,000 for pain and suffering.\nHe says in the suit that the company didn't provide him with workers' compensation coverage.\nPortland attorney J. William Savage is representing Leinweber.\nRead the lawsuit .\n-- Aimee Green\nagreen@oregonian.com\n503-294-5119\no_aimee", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/o_aimee"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:20:30.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
