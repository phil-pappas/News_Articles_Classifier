The members spent nearly two hours discussing it. \nWhile there were no objections with the financial and commercial declarations sought in the draft, several members raised concerns over the proposed rule affecting current and ex-cricketers.\nThe proposed rule... \nThe proposed rule says: \"A cricketer on the payroll of the BCCI or holding contracts with BCCI shall not be on any BCCI committees including IPL GC.\"\nIt also states that \"coaches and national selectors will not be associated with a player management company or a player agent, either honorary or paid.” Cricketers on the Managing Committee of any BCCI-affiliated unit “shall not be considered for appointment as a national selector.\"\nIt also stated: \"National coaches or selectors cannot run private academies during their tenure.\"\nMCA’s Joint Honorary Secretary Dr Unmesh Khanvilkar told mid-day: “Members felt that the rule affecting cricketers and selectors needs to be rethought. Our president (Sharad Pawar) will raise our concerns at the BCCI’s Annual General Meeting (on November 9).”\nMCA’s vice-president and former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar has been running cricket academies in Mumbai and Pune for over a decade now. MCA’s Managing Committee member and former Test cricketer Pravin Amre is currently Delhi Daredevils’ assistant coach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:32:16.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
