(Richard Skinner) -- Defensive back Leon Hall was among the seven players made inactive by the Bengals on Sunday to reach the 46-player game day limit for their game against the Buffalo Bills. \nThe game kicks off at 1 p.m. and can be seen on Local 12. \nYou can also: \nFOLLOW THE ACTION ALL GAME RIGHT HERE \nHall was listed as questionable for the game on Friday on the team's official NFL injury report. He suffered a back injury in last Sunday's game against Seattle and was limited to only 13 snaps. He was a limited participant in practice Wednesday, Thursday and Friday so it's a bit surprising he is unable to play. \nAlso made inactive for Sunday's game are: wide receivers Mario Alford and Greg Little; tight end C.J. Uzomah; rookie defensive tackle Marcus Hardison defensive tackle Pat Sims and defensive end Margus Hunt. \nIt marks the sixth straight game that Alford, Little, Uzomah, Hardison and Hunt were made inactive. \nSims being made inactive means that Brandon Thompson is active for the second straight game after not being active for the Kansas City game. \nBecause of Hall being inactive, cornerback Chris Lewis-Harris is active. It's the third game this season he has been active for a game. \nBILLS INACTIVES: Buffalo quarterback Tyrod Taylor was made inactive for Sunday's game meaning E.J. Manuel will make his first start since Sept. 24, 2014. \nTaylor had been listed as questionable after suffering and MCL sprain in last Sunday's game at Tennessee. \nAlso made inactive for the Bills are: wide receiver Percy Harvin; running back Karlos Williams; defensive back Josh Bush; guard Gabe Ikard; wide receiver Marcus Easley and defensive tackle Alex Carrington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:11:23.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
