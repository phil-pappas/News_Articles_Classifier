Bush leading applause on the opening tee, Bubba Watson struck the first blow for the US with a booming right-to-left drive that landed in the heart of the fairway. \n\nHideki Matsuyama rescued the situation for Scott with a solid approach as the hole was halved in par. \n\nBut then the Americans caught fire slamming in birdies at the next four holes to race to three up after just five. \n\nScott, in his seventh Presidents Cup, stayed patient and pulled a hole back at the seventh before playing a majestic wedge at the 10th to leave Matsuyama four feet away to cut the deficit to one. \n\nThe turning point came on the next hole when Scott, reverting to the short putter this week instead of the broomstick he has used for years, faced an eight-footer to square the match but pulled it horribly left under pressure. \n\nBy contrast Watson's partner J.B. Holmes was impeccable with the putter all day and sank birdies at the 15th and 16th to close out a 3 and 2 win. \n\nHolmes, only called into the side last Friday to replace the injured Jim Furyk, gelled wonderfully with the big-hitting double Masters champion. \n\n\"I was just happy to have a chance to play,\" Holmes said after his round. \"I felt bad for Jim but excited about the opportunity. \n\n\"We really like how the course is set up so it was a no-brainer to come out here today and play aggressive and we did what we wanted to do.\" \n\nPlayer of the year Jordan Spieth and partner Dustin Johnson had an uncharacteristic sloppy front nine against the similarly wayward pair of Marc Leishman and Danny Lee. \n\nBut the American duo showed their class after going to the ninth just one up and eventually ran away with the match 4 and 3. \n\nOnly one match went to the final hole as Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson led most of the way against Aussie pair Jason Day and Steven Bowditch. \n\nMickelson had an early contender for shot of the week when holing a 45-foot bunker blast at the short 13th to put his side 2 up. \n\nBut US PGA champion Day would not lie down and holed a monster birdie putt at the 17th to ensure the match went the distance. \n\nDay then boomed a drive down the 542-yard par-five 18th to leave Bowditch 230 yards to the pin but an adrenalin-fuelled Mickelson pulled out his own big guns and flew his tee shot past the Australian's by almost 60 yards. \n\nJohnson had just 186 yards to the flag and obliged with a measured six-iron to eight feet. \n\nWhen Day lagged his 20-foot eagle effort just left of the pin out came the handshakes and the Americans had secured their fourth point of a dominant opening day.
