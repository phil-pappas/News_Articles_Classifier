(Ravell Call/Deseret News) \nFor those who didn't understand Mendenhall's explanation, offensive coordinator Robert Anae broke it down in the language of the millennial college student after practice Wednesday. \n\"Our student support is off the chain,\" Anae said with only a hint of hesitation as he tried to find the right words. \"I don't know why this year, but that is evident. I've been at other schools where students make the game day atmosphere, and that is here, too. I've never seen it (like the 2015 season) here.\" \nStudents were seen camping out in front of the stadium as early as Tuesday afternoon, hoping to save a spot to reserve the best seat in the stadium on game day. The students, many of whom set up elaborate schedules to make sure there is always a member of their group in line, even hosted a special guest early in the week. People already camping out at the stadium!! Had to come hang. @Bronco_BYU can we have a sleep over with em!? pic.twitter.com/YUKnGGXTgU — Mitch Mathews (@mitchmathews10) October 7, 2015 \nBYU alum Cameron True, a former BYU hockey player and owner of Orem's Bam Bam's BBQ, took note of the support and quickly sent a reward to the dedicated group of campers. Thanks to @BamBamsBBQ for bringing us food in the ROC line tonight! Best BBQ around. #BeatECU #GoCougs pic.twitter.com/fToXsr9M3a — The Roar Of Cougars (@byuROC) October 7, 2015 \nBYU center Tejan Koroma feared the home crowd would lose significant numbers after an embarrassing 31-0 loss at Michigan. Even he was pleasantly surprised by the numbers in the stadium — and even more by the fire of those who show up days and hours before the gates open to camp out, tailgate and host their own pre-game rituals. \n\"It means a lot to us,\" Koroma said of the fans. \"We want to play for each other, but when you have people camping out, you want to give them something to watch.\" \nThe announced crowd of 56,393 saw BYU move to 3-2 on the year with a 30-13 win over UConn, and quarterback Tanner Mangum attributed the wild student section — recently dubbed the \"Roar of Cougars\" — for part of the win. \nHe said the loud, boisterous student body gets after opposing teams, especially when the Cougars are on defense and even more when they force a third down. That's led to stops, sacks, points and false starts — and it's even adding to the offensive game. \n\"We feed off that energy,\" Mangum said. \"We get a big play, and we hear that crowd getting into it, it motivates us. \n\"We want to play for them, and we love the support. It means a lot to us.\" \nIt means plenty on more than just game day, as well. Coaches and players have regularly dropped their jaws as they see the home support up to six days before kickoff. \nMendenhall made special mention of it on his weekly radio show on KSL NewsRadio , saying \"there is nothing better than these guys supporting BYU.\" @byuROC Rachel , Bree and Zach rule! Already camped out for Sat Game!!! pic.twitter.com/cSCYbpMinc — Bronco Mendenhall (@Bronco_BYU) October 7, 2015 \nMangum knows the Cougars can get better, and they'll try to do just that as they host East Carolina on homecoming night this Saturday at 5:30 p.m. \nMangum also said the fans should be able to expect a little bit more of an open playbook as the young Cougars who have lately put up to three freshmen together in the offensive backfield develop chemistry with each other. \n\"Each week we're able to do a little bit more as an offense, and that's something we hope to build game in and game out,\" the 22-year-old freshman said. \"The coaches are doing great, and they are helping me out a lot so I can feel comfortable.\" \nTo walk out with a win, Anae has a special request for the BYU faithful, whom he called \"electrifying.\" \n\"Students, keep going. You guys are rocking the college football world, and it's great to see the student involvement and the student body buy in to the game day atmosphere,\" Anae said. \"It's great to be a part of.\" Photos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:16:17.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
