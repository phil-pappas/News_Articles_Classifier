Shawn Byrne Miner Staff Reporter KINGMAN - One sign of a maturing team is how it handles the supposed-to-win matches. The Kingman Academy High volleyball squad exhibited that sign in the Lady Tigers Division IV, Section III win over River Valley Thursday at KAHS - 25-17, 26-24, 25-27, 25-15.\"We've started to come together,\" said KAHS volleyball coach Ken David. \"We can't look forward or look past anyone. We have to focus on every single point.\"Breezy Weber led the Academy (5-8, 1-1) with 16 digs and 12 kills.\"We worked so well as a team,\" the sophomore middle hitter said. \"We had mistakes, and that was the only thing that brought us down. Once we got over them, we worked as a team and it was perfect.\"Sophomore setter Shaunti Short had 25 assists and added four kills. Senior Ashteyn Whirlow served up five aces.The Lady Tigers' core group is made up of freshmen and sophomores, and they continue to experience hiccups, such as Game 3 when the Academy let a 19-11 lead disappear. River Valley (5-10, 1-1) rallied to win the game.\"It was all just our mistakes,\" Weber said. \"It was everything on our side of the net. We fixed it for the last game, so that was good.\"Another impressive manifestation from the Lady Tigers is their performance without sophomore hitter Aspen Jackson, who didn't play as she continued to nurse a sprained ankle. Jackson, despite missing the last three matches, leads the Academy with 69 kills. \"She's definitely our MVP,\" Weber said.At no point during the River Valley match did the Lady Tigers appear to miss Jackson.\"We've adjusted pretty quickly,\" David said. \"I have to give credit to the team with next lady up.\"Jackson said she was ready to return to practice, which she did on Friday. David said she felt good and trusted it more and that he expects her to be back at full speed this week.Academy faces Cortez (1-10, 0-2) Tuesday in Phoenix.
