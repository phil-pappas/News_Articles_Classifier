Of those, American journeyman Tyler Aldridge was the best placed at seven under with two holes remaining.\n\"It was nice to be the first off, the greens were perfect,\" Rodgers told reporters after teeing off in the first group of the day and storming to the turn in a sizzling five-under 30.\n\"I felt really comfortable and was able to roll in a few putts, especially there on that front nine. I definitely wasn't at my sharpest on the back but all in all a very good start.\"\nLevel with Rodgers at six under were nine other players including Japan's Ryo Ishikawa, South Korean D.H. Lee, Englishman Greg Owen and Americans Chad Campbell, Ricky Barnes, Ryan Palmer and Brendon Todd.\nSweden's Henrik Norlander was also at six under through 16 when play was abandoned.\nRodgers, whose best PGA Tour finish was a tie for second at this year's Wells Fargo Championship, felt he had also benefited from an eight-week break from competitive golf before starting the new season at the Frys.com Open in Napa, California.\n\"I made the most of my time off,\" said Rodgers, who was an outstanding amateur golfer at Stanford University where he won 11 times to match a record set by Tiger Woods.\n\"I felt really prepared last week, and I'm going to try to use to that my advantage this fall.\"\nRodgers made 12 of 17 cuts as a non-member on the 2014-15 PGA Tour, including two top-10s, before finishing in the top 125 in the FedExCup standings to secure his card for this season.\nAmerican world number five Rickie Fowler, the highest-ranked player in the field, hit his tee shot into water at the par-three 17th on the way to a double-bogey and an opening round of 72.\nHis compatriot Ben Martin, who clinched his first PGA Tour victory at last year's Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, launched his title defense with a 70.\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Frank Pingue/Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:38:14.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
