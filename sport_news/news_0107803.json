Lee/The New York Times \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story There was a residual upside for the Mets to having their starting shortstop’s right leg fractured Saturday night and a winnable postseason game turn on what they, to a man, considered a dirty, despicable play. For the two days leading into Game 3 of the teams’ National League division series, no one in New York seemed to remember that the agent Scott Boras (and by extension his innings-challenged client, Matt Harvey) was the embodiment of pure baseball evil as the Mets approached their most meaningful autumn in nine excruciating years. So from the bottom of Boras’s deal-leveraging heart: Thank you, Chase Utley, for easing the pregame pressure on Harvey, for sparing him the penetrating questions about how much of his earning future he was willing to lay on the line in the first-ever postseason game Monday night at Citi Field. OCT. 12, 2015 At least until his pitch count commenced, Harvey was just another witness to the wickedness, weighing in with pained restraint on the grave injustice done to Ruben Tejada. “It was kind of hard to see at first, you know, where exactly the slide started,” he said. “But after, obviously, the replay, everybody saw that it was more of a tackle than anything.” More than the right or wrong thing, Joe Torre tried to do the practical thing in his role as the game’s chief baseball officer by suspending Utley for two games — a ruling that was appealed by Utley but not heard Monday, as initially expected. Available to pinch-hit, or cause a riot, Utley began the game on the bench, and Torre hoped he remained there. He understood that the last thing the sport needed on this stage was the ritual cries for vigilantism, be they from the stands or from Harvey’s dugout.

That day, the obligatory warnings to both pitchers were issued after Estes threw one waist-high behind Clemens. Clemens became wary of pitching inside, and Piazza and even Estes took him deep in a humiliating Shea Stadium rout. Torre was the Yankees’ manager, his position sadly making him a Clemens apologist, claiming the whole episode was the figment of the news media’s imagination. In his administrative role, Torre obviously knew better and preferred to avoid letting a compelling series devolve into retribution. In full agreement, for his own selfish reasons, was Mets Manager Terry Collins. “The minute we make this some type of grudge match, we’re going to make some mistakes, and we can’t do that,” he said. Would retaliation be excessive punishment for an act that was not premeditated? In his statement, Torre said: “While I sincerely believe that Mr. Utley had no intention of injuring Ruben Tejada, and was attempting to help his club in a critical situation, I believe his slide was in violation of Official Baseball Rule 5.09 (a)(13), which is designed to protect fielders from precisely this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In other words, the lateness of the slide was reckless — and not only to Tejada but to Utley, who avoided a severe head injury given the contact with Tejada’s knee — but probably not malevolent. Common baseball sense said it was largely an act born of the Dodgers ’ desperation. They were a handful of outs away from having to face elimination against Harvey, the tying run crossing home plate as Utley tried to break up an inning-ending double play. Tejada’s injury inflamed the play’s outcome, but don’t believe this was an easy call for Torre. No one on either side is closer to him than Don Mattingly, whom he hired as his bench coach in New York and in Los Angeles, where Mattingly succeeded him as manager four years ago. Torre also managed the Mets, but eons ago, long before he became the highly credentialed St. Joe. Torre’s more partisan side was right about the news media’s role in propagating — if not creating — the spectacle of Armageddon. In the current case, armed and ready are the pundits to shame the Dodgers and their mammoth payroll should they fail to advance, with Mattingly fated for dismissal. Why would anyone be surprised when a competitor as intense as Utley responded to the drumbeat by going all gladiatorial? Had he veered away from the target of Tejada, and with the shortstop’s back precariously turned to him, Twitter would no doubt have lit up with a sneering critique of a 36-year-old has-been who left his verve in Philadelphia. And had the Mets won Game 2, Harvey would have come home to declarations of relief that they didn’t have to rely on a me-first pitcher, who considered bailing on the postseason to protect his arm and showed up late for a preplayoff workout. Instead, Harvey on Sunday was asked only about the missed practice (“what’s happened yesterday, in the past, all that’s been taken care of internally”) and if he might be available to pitch in relief in a Game 5 (“Yeah, I’d love to”). Absent were queries about whether Harvey would, given a faltering Mets’ bullpen, be willing to put himself out to the tune of 121 pitches, as Jacob deGrom valiantly did in Game 1. In large part because of Utley, the question of whether Harvey was all-innings-in, all the way to a potential World Series Game 7 on Nov. 4, went unasked. That didn’t mean it had been answered. In the hours before Game 3, Harvey’s to-date career-defining start, he was allowed to virtually hide. He just couldn’t run.
