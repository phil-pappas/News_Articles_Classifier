(Lori Van Buren / Times Union) Photo: Lori Van Buren A chat with Great Danes hoops player Mike Rowley 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nQ: You are no a junior, and this will be your first season at UAlbany without your brother, Sam, who graduated in June. How will that be for you? \nA: To be honest, from a basketball perspective, he was a very good player. For personal reasons, I am ready to take on a bigger role. Obviously, I loved Sam being here. He helped me out a lot, but I feel like I am ready to be here without Sam. \nQ: Safe to say that whenever anyone referred to you when Sam was here, it was as \"Sam's brother.\" \nA: Exactly. I am definitely ready to be recognized for my own accomplishments. \nQ: Have you changed your game any from last year? It looks like you might have bulked up a little bit. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information. \nA: I did put some more effort into the weight room. I think I have become a little bit more assertive, especially on the offensive end. Losing Sam, we are going to lose a bit of offense. It's up to us to pick up the slack. \nQ: You do expect to be a big contributor to this team, don't you? \nA: I am pretty ambitious about my role this year, but it's not going to be one person coming in to fulfill Sam's job. It will be a few of us, a collective effort. \nQ: (Coach) Will Brown told me you broke Sam's bench press record. True? \nA: (smiles). Yeah. I got him by five pounds. I lifted 320. \nQ: How many times? \nA: Just the once. I took the weights pretty serious over the summer. \nQ: Are you the strongest guy on the team? \nA: I would like to think so (smiles). \nQ: I don't want to compare you to your brother, but he was quiet. Are you quiet, too? \nA: I am quiet in the sense where I will not be the one ranting and raving on the court. I think I am a little more outgoing than Sam. \nQ: You were a footballer back home in Australia, weren't you? \nA: Yes. Rugby. \nQ: Did you ever think you would be a football player over here? \nA: American football? No! I am naive enough to think I could play American football. I love it. I watch it. But I could not see myself playing it. I would think you would have to grow up playing it in order to be any good at it. More Information \nContact Tim Wilkin at 518-454-5415 or email twilkin@times union. com \nQ: What is your favorite football team? \nA: I am a big Patriots fan. Back home, we would not get many teams (on TV), but we would always get the Patriots because they were always winning. I am a big Tom Brady fan. \nQ: Are you pretty good as a rugby player? \nA: I was alright when I was in high school. I was nothing special. \nQ: I would guess Will Brown might have a problem with you if you played a little pickup rugby here. \nA: He would shoot me. I see guys playing. I have said that once I finish the season, I would like to play club rugby here. \nQ: Who is the best dressed guy on your team? \nA: I would say Reece Williams . Without a doubt. He dresses well. \nQ: If you could have dinner with three people, living of dead, who would they be? \nA: That's a tough one. I would have to go with someone in the sporting world, like a Michael Jordan , even though it's a typical answer. How about Nelson Mandela ? I wold not mind having a conversation with him. Sharing a steak. And I wouldn't mind a one-on-one dinner with Jessica Alba . \nQ: If there was a movie made about your life, and you could pick the actor to play you, who would you pick? \nA: It would have to be an Australian. I would think it would have to be one of the Hemsworth brothers (there are three, Luke, Chris and Liam). I would settle for any of them. \nQ: Favorite basketball movie? \nA: \"White men can't jump.\" Without a doubt. I can relate very strongly to that movie (laughs). \nQ: So, you are a movie guy. What is your all-time favorite movie? \nA: Sam and I used to watch \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" but, recently, Pete (teammate Hooley) and I saw \"The Untouchables.\" That's a good one, but you can't go past Shawshank, in my opinion. \nQ: What do you do when you aren't playing basketball and you have a day to yourself? \nA: Movies are a big thing. Dallas (teammate Ennema) go to the movies a lot. We go to an almost embarrassing amount of movies. We are so tired, we just chill out. We play a lot of Fifa (soccer video game). We'll play that for hours on end. \nQ: Are you a funny guy? \nA: I like to think so. I like to joke around with the guys, I am not too serious, ever. Sometimes, I think that can be a bad thing, but I don't take things too seriously. \nQ: Do you think Will Brown thinks you're funny? \nA: I don't know. I am pretty quiet around coach. \nQ: Do you make him laugh? \nA: Maybe a little bit. I think I make him more frustrated by me being more chilled out and I think he would rather see me more intense. \nQ: Do you work on that? \nA: Yes and no. There are so many people who are intense on this team that I think it's a good balance to have a guy who is a little bit more chilled out. \nQ: Did you go home (to Sydney) at all this summer? \nA: Yes. For about two months. \nQ: What did you do? \nA: We live on the beach now, so I was just lying on the beach. Paradise. The beach is a two minute walk from our house. Home is a bit of a struggle for me. Really, I just catch up with friends. I didn't even get a job this year, which annoyed the parents a little bit. \nQ: So, basically, you just goofed off. \nA: Yeah (laughs). I worked out and then chilled out with friends. I was a big worn out from the (basketball) season. On the beach ... I get so over the winter from here. \nQ: Favorite holiday? \nA: Christmas, but summer Christmas in Australia. I love it. Winter Christmas here has its moments, like if you wake up to a white Christmas. But apart from that, nah. I will take the beach on Christmas any day. \nQ: Have you set any goals for yourself? \nA: I like the fact that all I have ever known here is going to the NCAA Tournament. That is the primary goal, to get back to the tournament. We just want to win. \nQ: If you could trade places with anyone in the world and do their job for a day, who would it be? \nA: We talk about this a lot. It would be either a professional surfer or golfer because I feel like they have the best gigs. Maybe Jason Day in the golf world or Kelly Slater or Mick Fanning in the surfing world. I would trade for them in a heartbeat. \nQ: Do you play golf? \nA: I picked it up over the summer. \nQ: Any good? \nA: I had my moments, but I'm horrible. I was saying \"Fore!\" a lot when we were playing. \nQ: Favorite TV show? \nA: I am a big \"Suits\" man. Have you heard of that? \nQ: Not really. What is it? \nA: It's on USA. About a law firm. \nQ: When everything is done for you at UAlbany, do you see yourself staying in the U.S. or going back to Australia? \nA: I see myself working here, but raising a family in Australia. I think work here for a couple years and then move back home. \nQ What is the reason you wear the number (10) you wear? \nA: There is no reason. I just like No. 10. I think one time, as a kid, I got that number and I played alright. I just kept it. I also used to wear No. 14 but Sam stole it off me. I was the original Rowley 14. \nQ: Why did he steal it? \nA: I don't know. In Australia, you get numbers from 4-15. We were always the biggest guys on the team and we had to get the biggest numbers. \nQ: Who is the funnier of the Rowley brothers? \nA: Me, without a doubt. \nQ: If someone called both of you at 3 in the morning and said they had a flat tire, which of you is most likely to get out of bed? \nA: Me, cause Sam would be dead asleep. He sleeps through everything. \nQ: Better cook? \nA: Sam. I don't cook at all. I can cook chicken and spaghetti. Sam gets all fancy with the spices and things. If I am trying to impress someone, I will order a gourmet meal and put it on a plate and pretend like I cooked it. \nQ: Well, at least you're honest. \nA: Exactly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:48:16.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
