The Dutchman is primarily a left-back, but has been deployed in the defensive midfield position on a number of occasions for club and country in recent years. \nThe Dutch manager, who signed Blind from Ajax last summer, mainly used him in midfield and left-back in his debut season at the club, but this campaign has seen him start in a central defensive role alongside Chris Smalling, and the duo have formed a formidable partnership keeping six clean sheets in all competitions. The 25-year-old defender has now revealed that he is most comfortable in his current position, but is open to playing in other positions as well, as he is confident that he can add value to the team in even playing in midfield or the full-back position. \n\"Of course, now I feel most comfortable in the centre-back position. There I play every week at Manchester United and I feel good. [But] I'm available anywhere,\" Blind told De Telegraaf, as quoted by the Mirror. \n\"It's not too difficult to plat at left-back again, or as a central defender or a midfielder. I know I can be an important link for the team. That's what I've shown in lots of games. I can be of value in any position,\" the Netherlands international added. \nMeanwhile, the Dutchman has refused to throw in the towel in Netherlands' struggle to qualify for next year's Euro 2016 finals in France. The Oranje have struggled in qualifying this year and their fate is no longer in their hands at the moment. \n\"It's very important for us to get third in the group. Unfortunately, we don't have it in our own hands anymore. Turkey have to lose and we need to win both of games. That's our job,\" Blind told United's official site. \n\"We're not giving up at the moment. We have to fight but we have to see what happens. They are two tough games we have to win but it's not only about that.\" \n\"If we want to have the chance to get to the Euros, there are no doubts about it - we have to win and Turkey must drop some points,\" the Red Devils defender added.
