When the 17-year-old tees up at the $2 million Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia at the Kuala Lumpur Golf & Country Club on Thursday, the Bengalurean will know what it would take to eventually get there. \n\nThe teen sensation, who will become only the second Indian (after Smriti Mehra) and the first amateur to play an LPGA event, came through a gruelling two-round regional qualifier two weeks ago to earn a chance to have a go against the who's who of women's golf. \n\n\"I have been following LPGA Tour events from a young age so it feels good to be finally playing one,\" said the Bengalurean, who is in the form of her life and would hope to carry that into the prestigious event. Having played the qualifier and a few other amateur events in the past, she will bank on the familiarity of the course to give the seasoned pros a run for their money. \"The fact that I have played this course before gives me the confidence going into the tournament,\" Aditi, who is ranked No. 19 in the World Amateur Golf Rankings, told TOI. \n\nDoes she have butterflies in her stomach? \"This is the biggest event I will be playing so I will be a bit nervous. But I don't think that is such a bad thing,\" she said. \"I don't know the level of competition on the LPGA as I have played only the European Tour events (LET), but I've been playing pretty good would just like to continue the form and keep doing what I have been doing all year.\" \n\nThe in-form golfer, however, said she hadn't set any targets in her maiden LPGA event. \"I would like to go without any expectation because that will help me play my natural game and not think too much about the field. I will just follow my process on each shot, that's it.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:01:52.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
