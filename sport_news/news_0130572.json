Following a 27-13 loss on the road to Hughson, Summerville running back/linebacker Nathaniel Ulvevadet felt that he let his team down. He rushed for a season-low 13 yards on seven carries, and the Bears fell to 2-2 after losing their second consecutive game. “I felt that as a leader and a three-year varsity player that I wasn’t able to inspire my team enough to get them able to come back and win,” Ulvevadet said Thursday after practice. The following week in practice, the Bears took a major hit when starting running back Jake Fulkerson reinjured his surgically repaired knee. The Summerville coaching staff had to shuffle players around mid-week before hosting Amador for homecoming. The coaching staff looked at Ulvevadet and moved him from his comfortable position of fullback to a more front-and-center role of tailback. “He put the needs of the team before his own,” said Summerville head coach Sean Leveroos. “It’s become second nature for us to expect that out of him. We would be surprised actually if it wasn’t what took place from him. As a coaching staff, we are blessed to have him and wish we had 30 more of him.” Ulvevadet went on to play one of the best games of his career. He rushed for 128 yards on 29 attempts. He averaged 4.4 yards per carry, even though he didn’t have a run longer than 14 yards. “He’s just that guy who is pretty consistent with the ball in his hands,” said senior guard Chris Caldera. “If you need yards, he’s going to get them for you. He’s also really special in that short yardage situation. Even if the opponents bring the house, he’s going to bust through the line and pick up the yards that we need.” Even more impressive than his offensive production was his defense. He had 13 tackles and four of them were solo. But he made maybe the play of the game late in the second quarter. The Bears (3-2, 1-0 MLL) were leading 15-9 and Amador had the ball in Summerville territory. Amador tried a pass, Ulvevadet read the quarterback’s eyes, jumped in front of his throw, made the interception and returned it 60 yards. The interception set up a 32-yard touchdown pass from Travis Rodgers to Eli McLaurin with 16-seconds left in the half. “Each game we discuss that you never know which play is going to be the pivotal moment of a game,” Leveroos said. “And that was a pivot point of the game. Amador was looking to put points up, but with his interception we flipped the field and put points on our end. It’s something that we harp a lot on and he carried out and executed.” Ulvevadet is the hands-down leader of the Bears and he leads by example. Spotting him on the sideline is as rare as spotting Bigfoot. He starts both ways, and also plays special teams. “I feel that if I don’t want other people to take plays off, then I shouldn’t,” Ulvevadet said. “I should play hard the whole game, because that is what I want my teammates to do too.” Not only is Ulvevadet the physical leader of the team, but he leads the Bears verbally. Before each game, he gathers the team together and leads them in prayer. He is also viewed as a second coach on the field. “It’s a gift to have a leader that is so well respected by his peers,” Leveroos said. “From freshmen to the seniors, if we need to get a message out, Ulvevadet is the one to deliver it.” “He is the heart and soul of this team,” said senior tight end Cole Brewster. “He’s our role model. Every time the coaches are looking for leadership, he is who they go to. If there is a problem on the field or something needs solving, he’s the enforcer.” In five games, Ulvevadet has rushed for 384 yards and eight touchdowns. He leads the Bears with 61 tackles and 23 solo tackles. As a three-year varsity starter, the senior has sophomore Jarred Brick lining up next to him at linebacker and is passing along his knowledge. “It helps a lot having him help me out because now I have a role model to look up to,” Brick said. “I just try to be a player just like him. Without any fear on the field and be able to go against anyone.” “I try to teach through example,” Ulvevadet said. “That’s the best way. I hope that I’m seen as a leader and as someone who plays hard and inspires others on the team.” Ulvevadet will lead the Bears tonight against Bret Harte at Dorroh Field. From the moment Bret Harte head coach Casey Kester saw No. 33 on film, he knew that was the player to stop. “He’s a very good player, a very good running back, and he’s going to be a challenge for us,” Kester said. “With the injuries that they have had, it’s forced them to kind of change their offense around a little bit and make him more of the cornerstone.” Following a big homecoming win last week, and Sonora on the schedule for next week, tonight against the 1-3 Bullfrogs could easily be a trap game, and Ulvevadet knows it. He said, “We just have to come ready to focus, play football, and most of all, hit them hard.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:22:26.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
