Stone suffered a collapsed lung and had to undergo open heart surgery, according to the gofundme account. \nThe account, created Thursday, had raised $1,595 by Friday afternoon. Included in the gofundme account was a picture of a bare-chested Stone in his hospital bed with surgical staples in a line from his midsection to his collarbone. \nThe fund page said the military is covering Stone’s medical expenses, but the money is needed to reimburse family members, including Stone’s mother and sister, for time they’ve had to take off work to care for him. It also cited some “very specific personal security issues” connected to Stone, but offered no further details. \nStone and two childhood friends from Sacramento became instant celebrities in August when they tackled and disarmed a gunman on a French train. Shortly before the midtown stabbing, Stone had been applauded by patrons in Sacramento’s Badlands nightclub. \nStone was released Thursday from UC Davis Medical Center. In a news release, he expressed thanks for the public’s support and for the expert care of emergency responders and the team at the medical center. \nPolice said Thursday that investigators were still working to identify Stone’s assailants. Surveillance video shows Stone fighting with at least two assailants in the intersection of 21st and K streets before he was stabbed. Spencer Stone released from UC Davis Medical Center \nA separate online gofundme page called Midtown’s Stand Against Violence has raised $2,555 after a week. Money raised in the fund, administered by the Midtown Business Association, will go toward a reward for any tip leading to the arrest of those who attacked Stone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:49:27.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
