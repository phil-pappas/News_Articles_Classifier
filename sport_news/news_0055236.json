That, in a large part, is due to stricter federal oversight by federal regulators in the wake of the financial crisis.\nThat push continued Monday with the $2.5 billion sale of GE's corporate aircraft financing unit to Global Jet Capital. The private company based in Boca Raton, Florida, will get a portfolio of loans and leases, more than 300 aircraft and a team of GE employees.\nTrian acquired 98.5 million shares, or about 1 percent of the Fairfield, Connecticut, company. The fund's executives, Peltz and Ed Garden, have a longstanding relationship with GE CEO Jeff Immelt and rather than a forced entry in which Trian would seek to force corporate changes from GE, it appeared the investment was in support of Immelt's goals.\n\"GE is executing a bold transformation that will generate attractive stockholder returns in the years ahead as the company reshapes its portfolio,\" Trian said in a printed statement.\nTrian, unlike with other major investments, has not asked GE for board representation.\nIn May, Dupont shareholders rejected a contentious campaign by Trian for seats on its board. The fund had sought more influence at DuPont, saying that the company was falling short of its potential. In June, Trian took a stake in the water and fluid-products systems company Pentair and pushed it to consider acquisitions.\nImmelt, meanwhile, says GE is looking forward to constructive dialogue with Trian as it moves ahead with its transformation.\nGeneral Electric shares rose 3 percnt, or 80 cents, to $26.27 at the open of trade Monday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
