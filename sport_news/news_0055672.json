The champion and runner-up receive a place in the final round of qualifying for the 2016 British Open at Royal Troon. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:32:38.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
