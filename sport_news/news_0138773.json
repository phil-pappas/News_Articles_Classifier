The strategy worked at Weibring Golf Club in Normal. Jump finished the back nine with four pars and two birdies to finish with a 78 and all-state honors. In the team’s first trip to the state tournament, Geneseo finished tied for eighth in the team standings shooting a score of 330 on both days of the two-day tournament on Oct. 17. It was an historic finish to a season where the golf team set a new standard for the program. For the first time in school history, the Maple Leafs won the Geneseo Invitational and added its first sectional title. After the Geneseo Invitational, coach Bess told the team not to let the Geneseo Invite be the highlight of the season and keep thinking about more. “I think they took it to heart,” Bess said. “I think once they saw the low scores they were putting up they knew what they had a chance to go do. They put that in the back of their heads and kept working toward their goal.” Jump’s two-day total of 156 landed him a share of 23rd place with the top 25 golfers earning all-state honors. On the 17th hole, Jump made birdie for the second-consecutive day on the treacherous par three. The Geneseo senior’s two birdies were just two of seven recorded on the hole during the tournament. He finished the back nine with a two-over par 37. Geneseo senior Ryan Ford was a stroke off all-state status with a two-day total of 158. Ford finished in a tie for 29th, shooting an 80 on the final day. A junior, Marshall Rice turned in a two-round total of 172 with an 86 in the final round. Nathan Lauritzen fired a 176 with two birdies on the back nine during his final round. The Leafs’ Wyatt Wade finished the tournament with a 178. Geneseo’s Jordan Anderson followed with a 179 finishing with a 86 in his final round. “I couldn’t have asked for much more out of these guys in my first season,” Bess said. “I told them, ‘Thank you for making year one for me outstanding.’ It was a blast. We didn’t have any issues or egos. They all knew their role and played to it.” By Chris Steele", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:30:33.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
