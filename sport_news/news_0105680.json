So now, I'm asking for prayers.”\nNorris, 22, was acquired from Toronto as the centerpiece of a three-prospect deal at the trade deadline. He went 3-2 with a 3.75 ERA in 13 starts -- eight for the Tigers and five for the Blue Jays -- this season.\n\"I was given the option to shut my year down & get it removed immediately,\" he wrote. \"However, seeing another doctor that determined I could wait until the end of the season reassured my gut feeling. Just Keep Playing.\"\nTigers general manager Al Avila, who was promoted as Dave Dombrowski's replacement days after the trade deadline, said the team knew about Norris’ cancer prior to the July 30 trade for left-handed ace David Price and that Norris is expected to make a full recovery for spring training. The Tigers declined further comment, citing it as a personal matter. Norris found out about the cancerous growth on his thyroid after he was sent to Triple-A Buffalo, Toronto's top affiliate.\n“Baseball kept me sane,\" Norris wrote on Instagram. \"Regardless of results on the field, I forgot about it when I was between the lines. Afterall, I was just trying to get the heck out of AAA. & I did. I was revived with an opportunity, a blessing from God, with the Tigers back in the Big Leagues.”\nNorris returned from a three-week stint on the disabled list for a left oblique injury in September, allowing one hit or fewer in three of his final four starts of the season and projects as a middle-of-the-rotation pitcher for the Tigers if healthy next season.\n\"I think Norris has a chance to be a top-flight guy,\" retiring Tigers pitching coach Jeff Jones told the Free Press earlier today.\nNorris, who was not able to be reached for comment today, asked for prayers that he come out of the surgery 100% cancer-free in the post, which ended with his favorite saying.\n“So yea, the power of prayer.. It got me through this season,\" he wrote. \"Now that it's over it's time to get this thing out, so please keep me in your thoughts & prayers as I undergo surgery & come out 100% cancer free! As always, #justkeeplivin”.\"\nHere's the full Instagram post:\n\"I’ve been debating for months as to how or even if I should share this with people. – I’m a firm believer in the power of prayer. So now, I’m asking for prayers. – A few months ago, after I was optioned to AAA, I found out I had a growth on my thyroid. Flying back & forth from Toronto to Buffalo after pitching to have more and more tests done it was finally concluded that the growth is considered malignant.. Meaning it contained the C word.. cancer. Hearing this was alarming, yea. Weird, yea, that too. I was given the option to shut my year down & get it removed immediately. However, seeing another doctor that determined I could wait until the end of the season reassured my gut feeling. Just Keep Playing. Baseball kept me sane.
