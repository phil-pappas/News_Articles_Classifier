From there, the Stags played steadily to eventually hammer out the win. \n“Sabi ko sa kanila, just maintain the right attitude. A positive attitude. As much as possible, I want them to go through their last games on a winning note,” said Stags’ coach Rodney Santos. \nThe Stags won their eighth game out of 16 matches. \nThe Altas played minus suspended players Nikko Cabiltes and Nestor Bantayan and struggled against the Stags’ big men. \nGabriel Dangangon had 22 points for the Altas, who stayed at third at 11-6. \nIn the second game, Tey Teodoro scored a game-high 32 points for the Jose Rizal University Heavy Bombers, who turned back the Lyceum Pirates, 64-55, to join the Altas to a share of third spot at 11-6. \nTeodoro had 12 in the third as the Heavy Bombers took a 51-43 spread at the end of the third. \n“We still have one game. Now, we have an opportunity. Our fate is in our hands, “ said JRU coach Vergel Meneses. \nThe Bombers play the Stags on Friday to boost their chances for a possible shot at a twice-to-beat advantage. \nIn junior action, Leeian Salazar sizzled with 22 points for the Lyceum Junior Pirates, who dumped the JRU Light Bombers, 87-63 and improve to fourth spot at 11-6. \nGeneroso Cecilio tallied 13 points for the Junior Pirates, who also improved their chances of reaching the Final Four. \nIn the other junior match, John Umali, Lance de Leon and Nick Rocero made 16 each as the Perpetual Help Junior Altas broke a 16-game losing skid with a 60-55 win over the SSC Staglets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:28:34.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
