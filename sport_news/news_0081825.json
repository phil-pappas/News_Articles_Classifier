Or, more likely, completely forgotten. An embarrassing, temporary mania.\nOf course, as I write this on Sunday afternoon, the Cubs have as yet only lost the first game to the Mets. But I’m going to go out on a limb, take one for the team, and brazenly assume they’ll lose the second too, and if they somehow win, they’ll still punt the series, because a) it’s the Cubs and that’s what they always do and, b) it might be the best chance of ensuring they’ll actually win the pennant.\nHow can that be?\nOPINION\nFollow @NeilSteinberg\nBaseball is not just bats and balls, throws and catches. Baseball is our most spiritual sport, sometimes more of a religion than a display of athletic prowess. It’s karmic. In our age of the dominance of flashier, faster, more TV-friendly sports such as football and basketball, the mere survival of baseball is a true miracle.\nThe baseball gods demand caution, modesty, and they must be appeased. When they are ignored, when you cross the Great Wheel of Baseball Fate, there are consequences. I saw this looming last week when the whole city started skipping around Wrigley Field, glorying in the team’s surprising victory over the Cardinals, like Israelites driven mad by the golden calf. They said things they should not have said. I kept my mouth shut, well, one tweet on Friday:\n“Chicagoans are so excited about the Cubs, I’m reluctant to whisper, ‘Isn’t this the point where they collapse and break your hearts again?’”\nChicagoans are so excited about the Cubs, I'm reluctant to whisper, \"Isn't this the point where they collapse and break your hearts again?\"\n— Neil Steinberg (@NeilSteinberg) October 16, 2015\nNo one noticed. No one wanted to face the truth.\nThen came what was to me — averse as I am to question a colleague — the Kiss of Death, Saturday.\n“THEY’RE GOING ALL THE WAY” predicted the headline on Rick Morrissey’s column .\nOh no , I thought, aghast.\n“They look unbeatable.”\nNo!\n“A force of nature.”\nShhh, don’t!\nI’m going to go out on a limb here and assume that Rick Morrissey is not Jewish. So he is not familiar with a concept in Yiddish called the “kine hora.” The evil eye. I suppose the closest equal in English is “counting your chickens before they’re hatched.” I think of it as “Flipping off Fate.”\nYou do that, you get what you deserve.\nI suppose it’s a result of all the “Moneyball” sabermetric number crunching that has so afflicted baseball in recent years. As if you could measure Rizzo’s bone density and the humidity of the air blowing in from right field and call the series for Chicago. You can’t. Baseball isn’t math, it’s poetry. Not science but philosophy. Baseball breaks your heart (“It is designed,” baseball commissioner A. Bart Giamatti once wrote, “to break your heart.”).\nThe Cubs being trampled by the Mets might be a secret kindness. What makes the Cubs such a special team, such a valuable commodity? Obviously not their string of championship victories. Just two things, really: 1) They play at Wrigley Field and 2) their incredible World Series drought.\nThe two are not unrelated. A winning team would have moved out to DuPage County years ago. The Cubs are like Naples, Italy — economic success eluded them and now failure is their success, their charm. When the Boston Red Sox ended their streak in 2004, it was a moment of joy, yes, but the joy that comes from leaping from a high place. Then they hit hard reality, won two more championships, and are now just another winning team, a sort of New York Yankees Lite. Their magic is gone.\nIs that what you really want? Fine. Consider this column my sacrifice on the Sacred Baseball Altar. The illusion dwelling in the heart of every fan is that they matter. That if they wear their lucky hat and cheer loud enough, the team will win. I’m not a fan; I’ve only been to one game this year. But I know the pennant is important to people and want to do my part. My predicting their defeat and standing by that prediction is the best guarantee the Cubs will win. It’s actually a win-win, for me. If they lose, then I will have been correct. And if they somehow manage to overtake the Mets, well, I’ll look bad, but I’ll also know that I’ve played my part in their victory.\nAnd if this all sounds crazy well, remember, it’s sports commentary. It’s supposed to sound crazy.\nTweets by @NeilSteinberg", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NeilSteinberg/status/654998290400964608", "https://twitter.com/NeilSteinberg"], "published": "2015-10-19T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:06:08.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
