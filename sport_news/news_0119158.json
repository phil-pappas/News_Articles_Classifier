The police monitor currently is part of the inspector general's office.\nQuatrevaux said an agreement signed in the office of City Council member Jared Brossett calls for separation of the agencies and dedicated funding from the city's general fund to the police monitor.\nHutson and Quatrevaux have been in disputes over funding. Quatrevaux last month called for the local Ethics Review Board to fire Hutson. He said she overstepped her authority, an accusation she denied.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
