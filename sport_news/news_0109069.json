However, the bones were sent for testing just to be sure. The sheriff pleaded with anyone who has information on the case to please come forward.\nAlonso was caught in Miami, Florida early Wednesday morning.\nHe was a handy man for 71-year-old Denis Duplantier and 70-year-old Suzanne Duplantier, police say. He was staying on their property and was sometimes an employee of the victims, according to the arrest warrant for Alonzo.\nFamily of the Duplantiers say they last spoke to the couple on Sunday, October 18, 2015 around 1:30 p.m. On Monday night, Baton Rouge Police were called after the Duplantier's children say they could not get in touch with their parents. They told police their parents were not at home, the house was left open, and a large amount of money had been taken. Their father's pickup truck was also missing, according to the warrant.\nThe arrest warrant states during a search of the Duplantier's home, blood was found in multiple rooms, \"consistent with a physical confrontation.\"\nAfter investigators used OnStar to track Denis Duplantier's missing truck, they found the couple's bodies in the backseat of a pickup truck that was parked at a Petro gas station in Hammond, LA. Surveillance video shows the pickup being parked and a suspect police believe to be Alonzo, get out and into another vehicle that had an accomplice inside.\nThe investigation revealed the victims were bound and beaten by the suspect until he gained entry into the couple's safe, where he obtained a large amount of money, according the warrant. The suspect is then accused of strangling Denis and Suzanne before driving to Hammond where the bodies were left.\nWhen Alonzo was arrested, the warrant states \"items consistent with those used in the homicide were located,\" when his property was searched.\nEvidence from the Duplantier's home was also collected and led officials to believe Alonzo to be the prime suspect, according to the warrant.\nAuthorities added Alonso will be extradited back to Baton Rouge and charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree kidnapping. Investigators are still looking for a possible accomplice.\nDistrict Attorney Hillar Moore said Alonso will face charges in Louisiana and this case will strongly be considered for a death penalty.\n\"It fits it on all the criteria, not only statutory, but by the egregious nature of the facts and how people were brutalized. This is a bad case,\" he stated.\nMoore also says, \"This is one that was planned. This is one that was sadistic in the treatment of these two fine people.\"\nThe investigation is ongoing.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
