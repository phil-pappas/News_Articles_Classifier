That's because the conditions here are superb and the organising is top class. \n“I have to thank Rashid al Kindi (the head of the organising committee) for such high-class arrangements here and I am happy to have marked the tenth anniversary of the RS:X class in Oman,” Vedova said. \n“The sport is among the most-spectator friendly ones and we will have the races near the shore. The championship is expected to be of high standards as a lot is at stake for the windsurfers. We hope to witness exciting races over the next few days,” he said. \nThe inaugural RS:X World Championships was held at Lake Garda, Italy in 2006, while subsequent worlds have been held in Cascais, Portugal; Auckland, New Zealand; Kerteminde, Denmark; Weymouth, UK; Perth, Australia; Cadiz, Spain; Buzios, Brazil; and Santander, Spain.
