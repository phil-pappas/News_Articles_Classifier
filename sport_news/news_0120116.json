Chicago Heads to NLCS By Jay Walker October 13, 2015 7:25 PM Share on Twitter Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images \nFor the first time in the history of the franchise, the Chicago Cubs and their fans are getting to celebrate a series clincher at Wrigley Field. \nAnthony Rizzo homered in the sixth to break a 4-4 tie and Kyle Schwarber hit a ball out of the stadium in the seventh as the Cubs defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 to win their best of five National League Division Series three games to one. \nTony Cruz doubled home a run and pinch hitter Brandon Moss followed with an RBI single as the Cardinals tied the game 4-4 in the sixth inning. \nBut Rizzo homered into the right field bleachers off losing pitcher Kevin Siegrist and Schwarber followed with his mammoth shot an inning later to provide the winning margin. The Cubs bullpen shut down the Cards in the final three innings. \nSteven Piscotty staked the Cardinals to an early 2-0 lead with a homer off Cubs’ starter Jason Hammel. But the Cubs came storming back with a four run second, highlighted by Javier Baez’ three run shot to give the Cubs a 4-2 lead. \nChicago now plays the winner of the Mets/Dodgers series in the best of seven Championship Series beginning Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:06:30.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
