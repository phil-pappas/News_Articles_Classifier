Friday's football game between Mankato West and Winona has a postseason feel, even though neither team will be eliminated because of the outcome. \n\"We need to do all the things we have to do to win a playoff game,\" West coach Mark Esch said. \"This really gets us into playoff mode.\" \nWest (7-0) plays at Winona (7-0) at 7 p.m. Friday, with the winner claiming the first Big Southeast District, Blue Division championship. It's like claiming a Big Nine Conference championship because the winner will be the only undefeated team from the old league. \nWest, which has already wrapped up the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye in Section 2 , has had some games that were close at halftime, but the final score didn't stay that way. The Scarlets are averaging 40.1 points and allowing 11.6 points. Winona is averaging 32.7 points and allowing 16.1 points. \nWinona already has a 1,000-yard rusher as Tanner Remlinger has gained 1,038 yards with 10 touchdowns. Quarterback P.J. Appicelli has made improvement during the season, completing 64 of 119 passes for 1,118 yards and nine scores. \n\"They're big and physical upfront, probably the best matchup we've had all season for our linemen,\" Esch said. \"Their skill guys can run. They're a run-first team, but they certainly can pass it when they want to.\" \nDefensively, linebacker Charlie Schwartz leads the Scarlets with 43 tackles, 5.5 sacks and one interception. Lineman Zachary Jakes has 44 tackles with three sacks, and lineman Brandon Marsh has 43 tackles and four sacks. Safety Hunter Frericks has made three interceptions, one more than cornerback Brock Annexstad. \n\"Stopping the run is the base of our defense,\" Esch said. \"Coach (Greg) Ellsworth makes that No. 1 each week, and that's where we're strong.\" \nJunior Rob Meidl will continue as the starting quarterback, though sophomore Zack Annexstad, who started the first three games before suffering a sprained ankle, is probably available. Meidl has rushed for 235 yards and five touchdowns and completed 32 of 58 passes for 419 with eight touchdowns and two interceptions. \nSenior Van Neils has rushed for 836 yards and 12 touchdowns, trying to become the first back-to-back 1,000-yard rusher since Chris Boyer in 1998-99. Charles Terry has 387 yards and five scores. Brock Annexstad is the top receiver with 36 catches for 426 yards and seven touchdowns. \n\"I think we're pretty tough to stop,\" Esch said. \"We have three running threats, and we're able to throw it. The offense has been improving, and the defense has been solid all season.\" \nEagles' Hail Mary \nMayer Lutheran scored with about a minute remaining to go ahead 22-17, but Maple River had enough time for one last drive. On the final play, Jeff Lewis completed a 40-yard pass to Noah Greenfield with no time remaining to claim the thrilling victory. \n\"I think we felt a little hopeless for a minute so we tried to keep everyone positive,\" Maple River coach Brian Schoneck said. \"We had three timeouts so I thought we still had a shot.\" \nThe final drive began at the Maple River 25, and a couple of short passes moved the ball toward midfield. There were penalties on both sides, but Lewis ran for 10 yards on fourth-and-10 to set up the final play. The ball was heaved into the end zone, and Schoneck couldn't see what happened until the celebration began. \n\"Noah said their guy just mis-timed his jump,\" Schoneck said. \"It was our homecoming, and we had a lot of fans and alumni at the game. All 59 guys dressed for the game. You couldn't have scripted a better ending. It's a game I'm sure the kids will talk about for a long time.\" \nBucs stop here \nWaterville-Elysian-Morristown is allowing only 9.0 points per game, but the Bucs' defense scored 24 points in Friday's 52-15 victory over Gibbon-Fairfax-Winthrop. \nTaylor Glende and Tyler Tegmeier each returned an interception for a touchdown, Hunter Frechette made a recovery in the end zone after a bad snap on a punt, and Zac Olson picked up a blocked punt and scored. The Bucs' defense now has six touchdowns this season. \n\"I think we've had two in a game but never four,\" WEM coach Jon Bakken said. \"Our defense has been really solid all year.\" \nWEM (7-0) hosts Mayer Lutheran (5-2). \nGames to watch \nOn Thursday, Wabasso (6-1) plays at New Ulm Cathedral (6-1) in a matchup of former Tomahawk Conference rivals. \nCleveland (6-1) can earn the No. 1 seed in Section 2, Nine-man with a home win against Edgerton/Ellsworth (5-2). \nMaple River (6-1) plays at New Richland-Hartland-Ellendale-Geneva (6-1), with the winner having a chance to share the district championship with WEM, should the Bucs lose. \nFollow Chad Courrier on Twitter @ChadCourrier  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:28:59.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
