Collins indicated he wanted to continue to use his players in the roles they are accustomed to.\n\"[Conforto] is going to be a very good player, and next year he’s going to be an everyday player,\" Collins said. \"We had lineups that we were going to use against left-handers. We told them, ‘look, you guys are going to face righties, and you’re going to face lefties.’\"\nYOUTH MOVEMENT: Tuesday marked the fourth straight game in which the Mets’ starter had no playoff experience, and Collins has been impressed with how his pitchers have handled it.\n\"They’ve handled the pressure, they understand what the major leagues are all about, that these big stages are what you play for and what you develop to be able to handle,\" Collins said. \"I salute the job of our minor league coaches and instructors have done to keep these guys’ heads on straight and not get too carried away with any situation.\"\nBRIEFS: Noah Syndergaard was not available in relief for Tuesday’s game. Syndergaard threw 115 pitches in Saturday’s loss. … Monday’s Game 3 drew the largest television audience in the New York market for a Mets game since 2012, per TBS.\nEmail: ehalt@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:16:57.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
