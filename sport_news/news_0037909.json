The incoming board members have vocally disagreed with recent changes in the district, notably the reconfiguration of the district’s elementary schools, which resulted in Hyde Elementary's closing. \n“This three-week time frame is unprecedented for a merger,” Zeiger said, adding that districts usually conduct years of feasibility studies before committing to combine. \nThe potential merger was first suggested in June 2014, during the same meeting where the board voted to close Hyde. \nTalks were put on hold in fall 2014 as Gov. Tom Wolf and state secretary of education Pedro Rivera took office. Now that the new state legislators are seated, the district felt it was appropriate to revisit talks, he said, Baker said. \nThe districts have considered merging several times before, and the upcoming elections offer a unique opportunity to dissolve both school boards in preparation for a merger, Baker said. \nBlending two demographically different districts would benefit both communities, he said. \nCornell serves students in Coraopolis and Neville Township. It is one of the smallest districts in Allegheny County, with fewer than 650 students in grades K-12. About 70 percent of students qualify for free or reduced lunch. \nMoon Area’s enrollment is just over 3,700, and district students have the opportunity to participate in a wide range of classes, sports and extracurricular activities just by virtue of the district’s size, Baker said. \n“The children coming to Moon, if you can provide them with broader opportunities and improved educational outcomes, why not do it?” Baker said. \nMonday’s presentation will be posted to Moon Area’s website, Baker said. \nThe agenda for Moon’s Oct. 12 board meeting hasn’t changed, Baker said. Community members from both districts are invited to attend the meeting and participate in public comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:40:34.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
