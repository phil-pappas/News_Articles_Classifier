She watched space sci-fi flick \"The Martian\" on opening night. She's a part of a team that builds and gets special permits to launch rockets that climb as high as 23,000 feet.\nOn Wednesday, a reporter quipped to Hamblin: \"So you're saying it might take a rocket scientist to win the Pac-12 title.\"\nHamblin had a response: \"It just might.\"\nThat's what it took last year, when Oregon State won the regular season title. Hamblin blocked an absurd percentage of shots that came her way, and the Beavers steamrolled the competition on the way to a 26-3 regular-season record, dropping only two games in conference play.\n  Oregon State is the favorite once again this year to rocket to the top. A preseason coaches' poll had the Beavers at No. 1 with 11 out of 12 first-place votes and just ahead of Stanford.\nBut that doesn't mean the Beavers want to replicate what happened last year. An early exit from the Pac-12 Tournament and getting bounced in the round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament was a bit of a sour finish for a team with much bigger ambitions.\n\"It's so easy for forget how hard it is to get to that point,\" Scott Rueck said. \"We lost an edge in early February. The experience is there. We learned a couple lessons.\"\nThe Beavers won't have to wait long to see how those lessons have held. OSU hosts Tennessee on Dec. 19 and visits Notre Dame on Dec. 28.\n\nBig rule changes in women's game\nQuarters instead of halves. Fewer timeouts.\nFor those who would complain about the difference between men's and women's basketball, Pac-12 coordinator of officials (and NBA ref) Violet Palmer would argue this: Between the two, the women's game is more progressive.\n\"It's going to be a lot of exciting changes in our game,\" she said. \"I think a couple years from now, we're going to be at this table looking at each other, and ask 'What took us so long?' \"\nThe NCAA has instituted a number of format changes designed to increase pace of play and shorten delays in the women's game, which Palmer admitted had become slightly lethargic. With fewer timeouts, shorter period breaks and more potential buzzer-beater situations, they hope this season provides some answers.\nOther changes include no 1-and-1 free throw attempts (all bonuses are two shots), and new guidelines on calling fouls in post play to make for less physicality.\nSome added benefit is from high school, to college, to the professional level, there's fewer changes for players to learn. And when it comes to quarters, there's no going back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:16:02.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
