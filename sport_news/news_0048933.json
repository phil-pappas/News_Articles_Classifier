After continued threats against League officials, coaches and referees, the League has only one option, to cancel the season. Today, October 13, 2015, ammunition shells were placed at the field gate with names of League officers printed with permanent marker. Due to the increase in violence of these threats, the safety of our children is the main concern. Decisions of this magnitude are not done lightly; rather they are done with the advice of the State Police, FBI, school administrators and League Officials. We hope that as parents you will agree with this decision and try and cooperate with everyone involved to bring forward the person or persons responsible for these actions. The league's future and our children's continued participation in future seasons is what is in jeopardy. This is obviously appalling behavior, especially considering the impact it has on the lives of the kids involved. Parents with kids in youth football should be worrying about keeping their children's brains and bodies safe, not ducking hollows from other angry adults.\n[via Facebook ]\n .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/654386620771246080", "https://www.facebook.com/NorveltColts/posts/429974757192881"], "published": "2015-10-15T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:24:39.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
