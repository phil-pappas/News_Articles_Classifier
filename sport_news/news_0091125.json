He juked Jones once before slipping it in. \nCarter made it 3-0 early in the second on a counterattack. Jones faced a 2-on-1 situation and could not stop the shot. San Jose coach Peter DeBoer challenged the call, which was upheld as a goal. \nWard put the Sharks on the board late in the second period. Brent Burns ' shot sailed into the glass, and Joe Pavelski gathered it and passed to Ward, who was open in front of the net to score his 99th career goal. \nCarter scored three seconds into a power play, firing a shot that bounced off the glass and deflected off Jones' pad into the net. \nNOTES: The Sharks recalled C Bryan Lerg one day after sending him out.
