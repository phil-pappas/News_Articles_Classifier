He was talking to mediapersons on his arrival at the Kangra airport. The Union minister was here to inaugurate the central air-conditioning system of the Kangra airport. Besides he inaugurated the VIP lounge. He said the Centre had no role to play in bringing down the airfare and there was neither a provision nor any budget meant for subsidising the airfare to the hill states. He said, “Himachal can provide the subsidy on airfare and no body is stopping the government from doing it.” He, however, said the refuelling facility would start at the airport which was under process.
