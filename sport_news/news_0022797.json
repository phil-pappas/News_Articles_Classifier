By Eric Curl Savannah’s mayoral and city council candidates, both incumbents and challengers, are receiving financial support from familiar names in the community ahead of the Nov. 3 municipal elections.\nMany of the donations have come from local businesses, as well as the company’s owners and top executives.\nOne of the more frequent and biggest contributors is Dulany Industries and the company’s CEO, Reed Dulany III, who has provided funding — mostly with the maximum $2,500 donation — for challengers in most of the contested council races. He also contributed funds to incumbent Alderwoman Carol Bell’s re-election campaign for the at-large post 1 seat, which is being challenged by Linda Wilder-Bryan, while offering no support to any candidate for the sixth district race. Brian Foster, who’s running for the seat being vacated by outgoing incumbent Tom Bordeaux in post 2, also received funding support from Dulany.\nDulany Industries is the parent company of the Sulfuric Acid Southern States Chemical manufacturer, the SeaGate Handling storage facility and the SeaPoint Industrial Terminal Complex, which all have locations along President Street.\nDulany said he typically does not contribute to political campaigns, but his concerns about crime and the city government’s lack of planning have spurred him to do what he can to try to bring about change.\nHis support for the challengers comes more than a year after Dulany flew City Manager Stephanie Cutter and Alderwoman Mary Osborne to Chattahooga, Tenn., in May 2014 so they could get briefed by city and law enforcement officials there on that city’s violence reduction initiative. Savannah is now in the process of establishing a similar program, but Dulany said he was disappointed the initiative has taken so long to get going.\nAfter interviewing most of the candidates he offered financial support to the ones he thought were best suited to lead the city in a new direction, he said.\n“I’m just trying to do what I can,” he said.\nThe businesses that have given at least $2,500 toward Eddie DeLoach’s campaign for mayor — which has accumulated about $100,000 in contributions since the end of June — include Dulany, The Pinyan Co., Envirovac Holdings, CTBS Holdings, Peeples Industries, Brassler USA and the Water Utility Management Co.\nMost of the top executives of those companies also made personal contributions to DeLoach, in addition to getting at least $2,500 in financial support from business owners such as Hillary and Lowell Kronowitz, who own Levy Jewelers, and Rick Culbreth, owner of Yates-Astro.\nAnother $2,500 contributor was listed as 1405 Inc., which shares the same address as Brassler.\nOn the incumbents’ side, Carol Bell, John Hall and Van Johnson, along with Mayor Edna Jackson, found favor with local businessman Stephen Green of Stephen Green Properties, who donated amounts ranging between $250 and $1,000 to each candidate. Green also contributed $1,000 to Foster’s run.\n“I’m supporting the candidates I think can do the best job,” Green said.\nJackson’s contributions topped six digits after she raised $42,355 during the most recent reporting period in addition to $64,441 in funds raised since January.\nMany of Jackson’s contributions consisted of $500 and $1,000 donations during this most recent reporting period, with her three biggest contributions — each for $2,500 — coming from Broughton Street developer Ben Carter and hotel operator Richard Kessler, who’s behind the planned $235 million hotel project on West River Street, and the Savannah Pilots Association.\nBoth Jackson and DeLoach received $500 donations from Martin Miller, the CEO of Coastal Home Care. Miller said his support now lies with DeLoach, who was not running when he made the contribution to Jackson’s campaign.\nMiller, who also contributed $2,500 to his brother Julian Miller’s campaign against District 4 Alderwoman Mary Ellen Sprague and $1,000 to Kim Dulek’s campaign against District 3 Alderman John Hall, said he regularly contributes to candidates he thinks will be the best leaders.\n“If we ask people to serve, than we have an obligation to help them,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/fasfaaf3qf.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/fasfaaf3qf.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:15:26.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
