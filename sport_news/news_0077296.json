But both teams seemed over-anxious and a little rusty. \nCity, who were under-strength and forced to start a front three who were all making their A-League debuts, collected a valuable point on the road, though Sydney seemed in control for much of the second half. \nWade Dekker, Uruguayan Bruno Fornaroli and Argentine Hernan Espindola started up front for Melbourne and Dekker marked his debut with a well-taken goal. \nFilip Holosko, who played 62 minutes in his A-League debut, tapped in Sydney's equalizer before halftime. Sydney applied pressure throughout the second half but couldn't achieve a winner: its best chance fizzled when George Blackwood met Rhyan Grant's accurate cross in front of an open goal but placed his volley wide. \nA double from new recruit Jame Maclaren lifted Brisbane to a 3-1 win over Western Sydney. Maclaren scored his first from a defensive error in the ninth minute but Mitch Nichols equalized five mintues later. \nGoals by Daniel Bowles in the 23rd minute and Maclaren's second from a set piece in the 34th gave Brisbane a convincing win. \nPortugese winger Fabio Ferreira scored twice from the penalty spot in Adelaide's 3-2 win over Perth. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:27:05.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
