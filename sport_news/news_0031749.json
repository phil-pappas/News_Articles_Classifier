FRANCISVILLE, La. (AP) - A West Feliciana Parish sheriff's deputy has been arrested on a simple assault charge.\nWBRZ-TV reports ( http://bit.ly/1G5ZEAd ) the deputy, Shane Lofton, surrendered on the charge Wednesday. The simple assault charge stems from an unrelated altercation Lofton had in Avoyelles Parish. Lofton allegedly threatened to kill another off-duty deputy.\nLofton also was recently accused of using racial slurs against black people during a traffic stop last week.\nLofton was only in jail for 20 minutes before being released on a $5,000 bond. It was unknown if he has an attorney.\nInformation from: WBRZ-TV, http://www.wbrz.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
