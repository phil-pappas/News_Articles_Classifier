In 31 appearances with the Red Wings, Pulkkinen learned it is little fun being a bit player.\nAs this regular season approached, Pulkkinen emphasized he does not want spot duty. He bolstered his argument for being a regular with two goals in Saturday's 4-3 victory at Carolina, both times showing quick handwork to get the job done.\n\"There is no guaranteed spot,\" Pulkkinen said. \"I am here to work hard. It is nice to get a couple of goals to get your confidence up.\"\nThe performance drew attention from captain Henrik Zetterberg, who noted Pulkkinen \"is not the biggest guy, but he knows where to be and he knows how to score goals. That is pretty nice to have that in this game.\"\nIt helps Pulkkinen that he has, in Jeff Blashill, a coach who knows him from the minors and wants him to succeed in the NHL. Blashill switched lines in the third period at Carolina, putting Pulkkinen with Dylan Larkin \"to see if they could have some chemistry,\" Blashill said.\nThey did.\nAs Zetterberg observed, Pulkkinen isn't big. But neither is Tomas Tatar, and he found a way to translate a standout AHL season into a regular NHL role. Now it is Pulkkinen's turn.\n\"With Pulkky,\" Blashill said, \"it is extremely important that he scores. And he has got to do it the right way. ... He knows he is not getting on the ice if he doesn't play a 200-foot game, if he doesn't play from the defensive side. But with that, he also had to score. That is what he does. That is what he brings to the table.\"\nContact Helene St. James: hstjames@freepress.com . Follow her on Twitter @helenestjames .
