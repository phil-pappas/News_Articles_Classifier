Thank you for listening to the voice of so many Athletes in this matter,\" tweeted Tuitert, the 2010 Olympic 1500m champion.\nIt is not the first time the EU has intervened over restrictions imposed on athletes. In 1995, the European Court of Justice effectively rewrote the rules on soccer transfers, handing much more power to players, in a landmark case involving Belgian midfielder Jean-Marc Bosman.\nExplaining its decision to take up the speed skating case, the EU competition authority said lifetime bans may prevent rival organizers from entering the market or drive them out of business, violating the bloc's rules.\n\"Athletes can only compete at the highest level for a limited number of years, so there must be good reasons for preventing them to take part in events,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\nThe Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for anti-competitive practices.\nLifetime bans, which exist in various sports, are the worst restrictions for an athlete, said Ben Van Rompuy, legal adviser for the two Dutch skaters.\n\"It means the end of an athlete's career. This is really about controlling what they do in their free time. There should be a good, objective reason for doing so, such as for safety reasons, not arbitrary reasons to foreclose the market,\" he said.\nThe Ice Derby events were shelved after the ISU modified its rules in January 2012. The sports body in a statement last year said it \"was unable to cooperate in any activity relating to betting/gambling in sports and that the ISU will not sanction the proposed Ice Derby International Competitions.\"\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Mark Trevelyan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:16:09.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
