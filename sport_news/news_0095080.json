(Sy Bean / The Seattle Times) Sounders FC tied the Houston Dynamo with a late Obafemi Martins goal, but lacked urgency in a 1-1 road draw that all but guarantees a one-game playoff spot. By Matt Pentz Seattle Times staff reporter \nHOUSTON — Few of the Sounders reacted when Obafemi Martins scored the game-tying goal with eight minutes left in a 1-1 tie with the Houston Dynamo on Sunday, the ball bouncing through a crowded penalty box before smashing off an unaware forehead on the way in. \nThe lack of jubilant fist pumps from one end of BBVA Compass Stadium made it unclear whether Martins had even scored at all. Was there a late foul called? Or maybe the offside flag had unfurled? \nSeattle defender Chad Marshall later said that the non-celebration was because Sounder FC was merely focused on adding another goal, pushing through for the game-winner. \nNobody rushed in to hustle the ball back to midfield. Martins gave Andy Rose a quick hug and gave Andreas Ivanschitz, who played the initial pass, a thumbs-up gesture. The rest of the Sounders simply jogged back into their half of the field.

As a result, our game was a little bit passive, a little bit slow. \n“It’s on me. … I prepared the team tactically. I thought we were just a little bit too slow with the ball. We needed to be more aggressive.” \nThese past few months, even when they were hovering on the edges of the postseason picture, the Sounders maintained a kind of stoic confidence. \nThey know the talent they have, the players will tell you. When it matters most, quality will rise to the surface. Don’t panic, seeding isn’t always as significant as you’d think. Just qualify for the playoffs and go from there. \nThe Sounders haven’t panicked. But maybe panic would have done them good Sunday. \nThis game was a dud. Houston was playing for its playoff life, and Seattle could have catapulted itself to one point from an automatic bye. Yet the game was played with very little urgency, the Sounders sending bombed pass after bombed pass over the top. \n“I think everybody was frustrated at halftime,” Seattle captain Brad Evans said. “Front to back, back to front, we weren’t finding the passes in the midfield. … We’ve got to do a better job of getting everybody involved.” \nHouston’s go-ahead goal was instructive. Seattle’s defense stretched, Brad Davis pulled back a pass for wide-open Ricardo Clark at the top of the box. The veteran midfielder had time to take a controlling touch, pick his spot and dribble a shot through a mass of bodies and past Seattle ‘keeper Stefan Frei. \n“It’s a stupid goal,” Frei said. “If no one’s there, I probably go and collect that ball. But I couldn’t see a thing there. And on a good day, we probably get that block, because there are so many guys there hustling to close down that shot and get a block.” \nThe attacking prowess of Martins and strike partner Clint Dempsey can sometimes act as an anesthetic, teammates have admitted. They deliver so often that it’s easy to assume that’s always going to be the case, even when the rest of the team is struggling. \nAnd Martins came through again with 10 minutes left, heading home Ivanschitz’s corner and stealing a point. But the unenthusiastic reaction said it all. This is a team that has been far from its best, and with the playoffs beginning soon, that’s a legitimate concern. \nThe draw helped Seattle’s standing some, pulling it a point free of San Jose and ahead of Kansas City thanks to the total-wins tiebreaker. But the result all but condemns the Sounders into the one-game play-in round. \nWhether Seattle hosts or hits the road will be decided next weekend?? at home against Real Salt Lake. Given recent performances away from CenturyLink Field, that could mean the difference between a deep run and one-and-done. \n“It’s about looking at each other square in the eye,” Evans said. “At the back, we’ve got to get better, in the midfield we’ve got to get better and up top we’ve got to get better. That’s the bottom line. But sometimes, sneaking into the playoffs isn’t always about the best team. It’s about who can get the result at the right time.” Matt Pentz: 206-464-3184 or mpentz@seattletimes.com .
