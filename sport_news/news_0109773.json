Pleasant News \nThe Iowa Wesleyan soccer team picked up its third win in five games on Wednesday afternoon with a 1-0 win over Fairhaven Baptist College. It was the Tigers’ second win over Fairhaven this month. \nThe Tigers dominated the ball all game and kept up scoring chances constantly throughout, but Fairhaven goalkeeper Thomas Gunzenhauser was on his game, and IW was held scoreless for the first 15 minutes. \nLate in the 17th minute of the game, however, Josue Nicholas got one past Gunzenhauser. With the Tigers working the ball around the box, the ball trickled to Nicholas at the far sideline, and he hit a laser that went off the hands of a diving Gunzenhauser and into the net. \nThe Tigers continued to dominate ball possession, and the ball was rarely on the Fairhaven scoring side, but IW was unable to add to the lead in the first half. The Tigers outshot FBC 15-1 in the first half, but held a slim 1-0 lead at halftime. \nThe second half looked like a carbon copy of the first, with the Tigers getting shot after shot on their end. Fairhaven almost tied the game up early in the period on a one-man rush, when a soft shot went over the head of IW goalkeeper Josh Bonilla and off the top of the crossbar. \nIsaiah Lucatero-Flores was robbed of a goal on a diving save with five minutes left. Just a couple of minutes after that save, the Tigers had two header opportunities, one that went off the crossbar and a rebound attempt that was saved right after. \nThe flurry of IW shots didn’t result in anymore goals, but it did keep Fairhaven on their heels throughout the second half, and FBC was unable to get enough opportunities to tie the game up, and the Tigers walked away victorious. \nNicholas’ goal was the only shot that went in for either team, but the Tigers did have 26 shots on goal in the game to FBC’s three. Lucatero-Flores, Gabriel Torres and Efrain Anaya each had there shots on goal to lead the team. Bonilla finished with two saves on the day. \nThe Tigers moved to 3-6 with the win, and will go for their first conference victory on Saturday against Westminster. IW currently sits at 0-1 in the SLIAC. The home game starts at 1 p.m., with the girls’ game to follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:29:32.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
