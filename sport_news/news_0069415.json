Comey told his staff to gather data on shootings by police.\nIt didn’t exist. The reporting of those statistics by local police departments to federal authorities is voluntary.\nWhen Comey addresses the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference at McCormick Place on Monday, and President Obama follows on Tuesday, we hope they will urge the chiefs to get on board. Better than that, Comey and the president should use this opportunity in Chicago next week to push for a federal law that makes the reporting mandatory.\nEDITORIAL\nFollow @csteditorials\nWe live in a data-driven culture and those numbers should be readily available.\n“You can tell how many people saw ‘The Martian’ movie last week,” Comey said in a talk at the University of Chicago Law School on Friday. “We cannot say how many people in the country were shot.”\nA national conversation on community policing has taken on greater urgency in the wake of an ever-longer string of videos showing mistreatment and shootings of African Americans by police. A series of deaths, including the one in Ferguson, beg for additional transparency of police-involved shootings.\nComey pointed out that the Washington Post and the Guardian are building databases that count fatal shootings by police. That the FBI cannot is inexcusable.\n“It’s embarrassing,” he said, “that we as a government don’t have data.”\nAccording to the Post, 800 people have been killed in shootings by police this year. About half the victims were white and half minorities. In late May the newspaper reported that among unarmed victims, two-thirds were black or Hispanic. It’s too early to draw conclusions, but compiling data could over time reveal trends and lead to improved policing.\n“Collecting data, I think, is something that’s going to be very important in guiding us forward,” President Obama said Thursday in Washington in a panel discussion on criminal justice reform. “We don’t really do a good job right now in collecting national data on a real-time basis, but we now have the tools and the technology to do it better. And the better our data, the better we can target where is real crime going on, where are we seeing maybe some problems in police-community interactions that we can catch ahead of time.”\nMost police do a valiant job of protecting their communities. Most are honorable professionals willing to put their lives on the line for us. But videos and testimony about mistreatment and brutality cannot be ignored. And lives lost, no matter if it’s a criminal or cop who pulls the trigger, count and must be counted.\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter: @csteditorials\nTweets by @CSTeditorials", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/csteditorials", "https://twitter.com/CSTeditorials"], "published": "2015-10-26T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:52:19.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
