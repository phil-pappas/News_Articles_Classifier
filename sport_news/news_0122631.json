It’s a process, right? Sure, we may have lost to such and such team, but they were more talented. Yes, that one hurt, but look at the growth! The SEC is tough, but as always, just focus on recruiting! \nTonight, my friends, I am failing to find the silver linings. Kentucky went to Starkville as a 13-point underdog, but lost by double that, 42-16. Simply put, the Cats got whipped. Dak Prescott moved the ball at will and Kentucky’s offense once again made too many errors to stay in the game. Whereas in 80% of the games in the Mark Stoops era, we’ve been able to point to some kind of positive, there’s nothing worth taking away from this loss. It was that bad. \nGrab another drink and let’s go over it. There was no answer for Dak Prescott \nFrom the get go, it was clear the Cats could not stop Dak Prescott. Mississippi State’s senior quarterback threw for 348 yards and three touchdowns and ran 117 yards for three more. SIX touchdowns, but at times, it felt like more. Dak might as well have been throwing to his favorite receiver in the backyard, because the Cats failed to pressure him for most of the game. Dak’s offensive line deserves a lot of credit, but they should also turn around and thank UK’s defensive line, who was sluggish and inefficient. With Melvin Lewis out, it was Matt Elam’s time to shine, but he seemed blinded in the headlights. Elam finished with one tackle. Cory Johnson stepped in to help and got eight tackles, but Dak and his offensive line were too much for UK to handle. Too many mental errors on offense \nThe defense had its worse showing of the year, but for all the mental errors they made, the offense didn’t do much better. It was all so promising at the beginning. Boom Williams moved the ball easily down the field and Patrick was putting the ball in the receivers’ hands; unfortunately, more often than not, they dropped it. Dorian Baker and Garrett Johnson had huge drops that stalled drives in the second quarter, the latest in a series of gaffs by the offense that is quickly becoming defined more by their shortcomings than their accomplishments. Stoops was forced to ice his own kicker @UKDad21 \nThe turning point in the game? UK was down by four with the ball at the end of the second half and was poised to kick the field goal to cut the lead to one, but Mark Stoops was forced to call a timeout to avoid a delay of game penalty. Therefore, Stoops inadvertently iced his own kicker and MacGinnis missed the next attempt. From there, Mississippi State outscored Kentucky 28-6. After the game, Stoops told Tom Leach he wished he had gone for it on the play, but “if ands and buts were candy and nuts, it would be Christmas every day.” \nAfter a Patrick Towles interception, Mississippi State scored two quick touchdowns, and even though MacGinnis kicked a field goal to give Kentucky three more points, the damage was done. 28-13 Bulldogs. The second half was worse \nKentucky is 0-20 when trailing at halftime under Stoops, and they certainly lived up to that stat tonight. Dak continued to have his way with the Cats, who looked completely gassed. For the eternal optimist, there were slivers of hope: Mississippi State missed a field goal and Kentucky put together a decent series only to shoot itself in the foot by more dumb errors. The blame on this one goes to Ramsey Meyers, who was called for a personal foul when he punched a player. If that wasn’t bad enough, Kentucky dug itself out of that hole just in time for Jordan Swindle to get called for holding. MacGinnis got Kentucky its last three points on that drive, but judging by Kentucky’s effort and demeanor, the game was over. \nThe most telling sign Stoops thought the game was over? Drew Barker went in \nBarker went in with seven minutes and change left. The Barker supporters cheered with glee until the redshirt freshman threw a pick on his fourth play from scrimmage. Whatever quarterback controversy existed was quickly quashed. After the game, Stoops said it was good to see Drew get some time, but there wasn’t any hint of a quarterback change. Hate on Patrick all you want, but his play wasn’t even close to UK’s biggest issue tonight. If pressed, there are three positives from this game Chris Westry picked off Dak Prescott in the second half, Dak’s first interception of the season. I don’t think Westry knew it at the time, but he kept Andre Woodson’s SEC record for consecutive pass attempts without an interception safe at 325. Good job, young one! The young guys got some play at the end. Sihiem King showed flashes of brilliance, racking up 31 yards on 3 carries late in the fourth quarter. Alexander Montgomery also looked good. This was all against Mississippi State’s second string, so take it for what it’s worth. I’m stretching here. Possibly UK’s toughest test of the season is over with. Hopefully they will bury it and move on. Where do we go from here? \nThat’s the question every UK fan is asking right now. Most will joke “basketball season,” but the loyal fans amongst us have the right to be perplexed by tonight’s performance. While there has been undeniable progress under Stoops — recruiting, facilities, record — the program still manages to shoot itself in the foot time and time again, a troubling pattern the program just can’t shake. In two of its three losses, Kentucky had a legitimate shot to win, but failed to capitalize. Program-defining upsets were on the tee for the taking. Tonight? Kentucky just crapped the bed. \nAt the time, the wins over South Carolina and Missouri felt great, but looking back, were they? South Carolina is so bad Spurrier left and Missouri just lost to Vanderbilt. The same can be said for any “marquee win” during the Stoops era. Suddenly, that game at Vandy on November 14th isn’t looking like a gimme. Given their effort against Alabama, I can’t even think about the Tennessee game yet. \nThe hard question I’m left with tonight? With mental lapses, questionable play calling, and glaring weaknesses, how much of this is “progress” and how much of it is making excuses?

Sure its frustrating, but at what point in this season has any of their performances indicated otherwise? Josh October 25, 2015 at 1:02 am | Permalink | Reply \nWe got beat tonight by a time that started 1 freshman on offense, the rest juniors and seniors. Defensively much of the very same for MSU. When we make it it to where we have freshman and sophomores backing up juniors and seniors and not the other way around we will see better results. Football is totally a game of slow progression, Stoops is getting it done, just a year or so away. Totally a better team since he has been the coach. SEC October 25, 2015 at 7:11 am | Permalink \nBut what about Stoop’s used car sales pitch about early playing time? How does that work when you start Juniors and Seniors? TKAT October 25, 2015 at 1:06 am | Permalink | Reply \nTeam played hard, did many good things. Kentucky used to play teams like State and the game was over in the 1st QTR. Teams this year, Florida, Auburn, State, are having to give effort all game to get the win. We are getting there, takes time. Capt. Reality October 25, 2015 at 1:39 am | Permalink | Reply \nSimply put..UK does not have SEC talent yet. Matt Elam is the epitome of UK.. High hopes, but simply a joke of an SEC player. We do not have the horses. The SEC is much much better than what we have. Tennessee will destroy us. They have FAR FAR superior talent to UK. We will be darn lucky to get to 6-6. UL is much improved and only Charlotte and maybe…I repeat…maybe Vandy are potential wins. Just like last year….5-7 more likely. Ben October 25, 2015 at 8:01 am | Permalink \nUL is not much improved. They almost lost to BC, the worst team in the ACC, and that is saying something. UL is terrible. We looked terrible also, but don’t think for a second that UL is any good. O is bad October 25, 2015 at 1:43 am | Permalink | Reply \nDon’t try to hang this on the D. They kept us in the game most of the way but the offense couldn’t do squat and kept putting the D back out on the field. Towles is a towel. He’s a junior and still can’t throw a route consistently. One is good the other is way behind the receiver. He can throw it down field fairly well. He makes terrible decisions also. Stare’s down the receivers, hence all the picks. I’ll pray for 6 wins and a bowl then hope Barker looks better for next season. His off-field decisions don’t really point to him being smart or a leader. I guess we’ll see. Dennis October 25, 2015 at 1:49 am | Permalink \nO is bad I guess we watched different games. I was watching on the SEC network. You? A QB can’t make receivers catch balls, make your O-line effective or make your offensive coordinator or defensive coordinator make good calls. With 7 games into the season I am at a loss to try to describe our identity to anyone. WeareBBN October 25, 2015 at 1:52 am | Permalink \nPat does badly miss lots of open guys way too much to be an SEC QB for a quality team. I do think he holds us back but also feel he is our best option at this point since he at least has game experience. WeareBBN October 25, 2015 at 1:50 am | Permalink | Reply \nGood write up TT. I do agree that looking back our wins are not impressive at all…ULL is horrible and we escaped late, EKU ditto, Mizzou is not good as we now know and USC ditto. The close loss to Auburn is bad as it was at home and they are average. Could say UF close loss is a positive but they were starting a Fr QB in 1st ever road start and made big plays for them. Plus I don;t think UF is that good but is probably 2nd best team we have played. I don’t think we are as bad as we showed this evening, but it seems we are closer to being that bad team than we are being a real contender. The positive I still see is our best players are young guys who hopefully will get better and are getting great game experience. UKBlue October 25, 2015 at 1:51 am | Permalink | Reply \nWe as UK fans at least for now need to stop think we are something we aren’t at least for now. We aren’t any where close to being good enough to compete with middle to top SEC teams. If we can barely beat EKU at home, really what did you think was going to happen in this game? How did Vegas not have the line at way more !! No point getting hyped for the UT game because they’re more than likely going to kills us. Lol October 25, 2015 at 1:56 am | Permalink | Reply \nIt does not matter. It was a bad night in all phases of the game tonight. As for patrick towles he has 9 touchdowns to 10 interceptions. No excuse for that. That is not acceptable in the SEC. It will not get it done. Brian Kassinger October 25, 2015 at 2:20 am | Permalink | Reply \nStop trying to find a player to pin this on….the coaching staff in genreal did a VERY poor job planning and executing a game plan…if one actually existed. Freaking amazing the poor planning for this game!!! timer October 25, 2015 at 4:46 am | Permalink \nI like Stoops and Co., but they were totally out-coached in this game. They did not have the team prepared to play, they didn’t seem to have any semblance of a game plan, and they did not make any meaningful adjustments during the game. \nButch Jones will have his team ready to play next week. If Stoops and his assistants do not do a much better job this week we will be embarrassed…..again. Mike from DC October 25, 2015 at 7:02 am | Permalink \nWhen as a fan base are we gonna start calling for a new DC? The Defense has gotten worse each year(Please don’t try and sell me on losing Z and Bud). Stoops is supposed to be a defensive coach, he has had 3 years and his defense is hot garbage. We need to start putting things on him. Tommycatsfan October 25, 2015 at 2:30 am | Permalink | Reply \nI caught holy hell on here for pointing out the obvious. We suck. I am a fan. We suck. I was at game and it was embarrassing. Nothing like getting ridden out of stadium by MSU fans. Seriously ?! All these “Beat State” people on here. Yeah, right. Remember the article about MSU was worst team in SEC that we must beat? They are so far ahead of UK its ridiculous. BTW: MSU stadium is smaller than Commonwealth. The environment here was 1000 times better than CW ever will be. All the pie in the sky people that get on here criticizing anyone that doesn’t drink the blue football Koolaid are delusional. I saw Barnhart at game. I suppose he was here to give Stoops another raise. UT will roll UK next week but it doesn’t matter. As long as UK wears black and a cool helmet, right? \nBTW: WKU played LSU tougher than UK did MSU, the worst team in the West according to KSR. But we are bigger, stronger, faster, right? \nI could block Matt Elam. Geez…. BigBlue37 October 25, 2015 at 3:26 am | Permalink \nDude…Shut. The. F*ck. Up. \nYou sound like a dumb bitch on her period. If you’re not going to stand with this program then go root for the “football school” down the road that can barely beat Boston College. Or go f*cking root for MSU since they’re sooo far ahead of us, and their stadium atmosphere is “1000 times better than CW will ever be.” DesignatedDrinker October 25, 2015 at 4:03 am | Permalink \nTend to agree. Ksr is leading the hype machine on football. Stoops is 11-20 here now, Missouri and USCar are the big wins and Mizzou just lost to Vandy. I like Stoops, but the coaching staff is not above being questioned. They need to get better, the delay of game forcing the timeout boils down to coaching. The play calling at the end of the Auburn game, was coaching. The lack of offensive creativity all season is coaching. Jones saying we are a mediocre SEC team, not really, we are in the bottom third probably and the SEC is down compared to a few years ago. Still think we get to 7 wins and have a fantastic season, but it would be nice to have a big win, like in 2007 to know that the program was relevant. Mike from DC October 25, 2015 at 7:07 am | Permalink \nWhile I tend to think you are being slightly over reacting, in general I agree. However, one could argue that CWS is bad because of people like you, who want to bail and not be held accountable for anything. \nThere was a caller the other day that said it best, we haven’t beat MSU since Rich Brooks walked the sidelines. That is unacceptable. Admittedly, idk what the answer is, but we need to figure it out and quick. Also, Shannon Dawson makes the Joker Phillips hiring look like a home run Aukfandude October 25, 2015 at 9:00 am | Permalink \nAgreed. Smoke and mirrors. Its basketball season now. Stoops and this defense is sad. UK football will always stink. First comment guy prob still thinks we will win every game left on schedule. Ha! Sammy October 25, 2015 at 4:49 am | Permalink | Reply \nI’ve enjoyed the season up until now. In the end UK football always finds a way to be UK football. I actually believed for a bit. There is no emotion involved in saying that. It is what it is. So…. When does basketball start? BluKudzu October 25, 2015 at 6:46 am | Permalink | Reply \nThinking maybe since the last raise Stoops had recieved, we are 4-9. Looking at the rest of this schedule, I am thinking 5-13, maybe 6-12. Oh yeah, we will be playing teams that also have young players too. Maybe our recruiting is not as great as we think, our perhaps could it be coaching? This type of team effort is humiliating. This has got to be on the coaches. Shaking My Head October 25, 2015 at 7:27 am | Permalink | Reply \nEveryone says Stoops is a great recruiter. Though it seems he’s recruiting on a higher lever, the classes have all been ranked at or near the bottom of the SEC. Yet, here are all the homers wondering why this team can’t get quality SEC wins. Steve October 25, 2015 at 7:28 am | Permalink | Reply \n2 losses in a row, 2 more on the way. Charlotte game can’t get here fast enough. I said that we would not go to a bowl game with Towles as QB. I knew this would be an ugly loss. We had our chances n the previous games, but more INT’s than TD’s is we got. He may be our only option due to Reese’s injury, but that does not mean Towles is a good QB or leader. He is definitely not an elite QB. I am not even talking about this game. We have struggled all year to win 4. We can not beat a good defense. Tennessee’s D looked pretty good against Bama, Georgia on the road, Louisville’s D is improving every week. Charlotte and Vandy. Charlotte may be a win,. Vandy on the road? We always seem to struggle with them. The crowds will start to dwindle at CWS now. The more we lose games, the more we will lose fans (spectators). 5 – 7 record. May be Gunnar Hoke will come in and take over the QB spot. We had our chances this year but did not seize the moment: the moment has passed. 3 years of Towles will be a 15-21 record at best 247 October 25, 2015 at 8:24 am | Permalink \nGunnar Hoak. LOL. He’s the 37th ranked QB in this recruiting class. THERE ARE 36 INCOMING QBs BETTER THAN HIM THIS YEAR! But, let’s believe KSRs hype over actual statistics, so when the time comes, we can all wonder why another UK player can’t live up to expectations.
