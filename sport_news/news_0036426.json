Mason had left the team Monday to attend to a personal family issue and returned to the ice Wednesday for the morning skate, but he did not dress for that night's game. \nThe Flyers were off Thursday and Mason was back with the team in full on Friday, his first practice since Sunday. \n\"There was definitely a mental hurdle that needed to be overcome,\" Mason said. \"It just takes time. That's why I took the time to come out to morning skate first just to be around the guys and also to start working back at hockey and doing the things you love to do. \n\"It's definitely nice to be back around the team setting here and just focusing on hockey again.\" More coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:11:03.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
