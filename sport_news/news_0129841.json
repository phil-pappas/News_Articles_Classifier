Gibbs had expected the bright yellow race car would end the afternoon a few hundred yards away, in victory lane, not in a sprawling post-race garage at Kansas Speedway. \nSeries wins leader Matt Kenseth would have his sixth victory and a berth into the next round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup, so he thought. It was completely plausible the way Kenseth had ruled the afternoon. But after leading 153 of 269 laps in the Hollywood Casino 400 on Sunday, one of Gibbs’ former employees, the driver Kenseth had replaced in the No. 20, coincidentally, was celebrating in victory lane instead. \nTeam Penske’s Joey Logano, responding to two block attempts, had turned Kenseth off the lead with five laps left in the scheduled distance and held on to win in a green-white-checkered finish. Joey Logano takes Kansas for second straight Chase race win \nIt was a win that in theory would have meant more to Kenseth. But it could ultimately prove to be a key move in Logano's grab for a first championship at NASCAR’s highest level. \nA win for Kenseth would have sustained his title hopes in the brutal elimination-style NASCAR playoffs and sent him along with Logano — who earned a spot last week with a victory at Charlotte — into the third round. Instead, after finishing 14th, Kenseth is mired 35 points out of the eighth and final transfer spot and in an unenviable must-win situation next Sunday Talladega Superspeedway. \nGibbs was displeased. \n“Everybody saw what happened,” he said. “That’s all I’m going to comment on.” \nLogano’s team owner, Roger Penske, said it was “one of those racing accidents.” \nKenseth said he was “absolutely, 100 percent” wrecked intentionally. \nLogano said he was racing for the trophy within immediate reach, not the one possibly awaiting after the final race of the season at Homestead-Miami Speedway. It was a case of two drivers in an inherently selfish sport acting selfishly over the second lane each wanted. \n“You want to win the race,” Logano said. “That's part of the strategy when you go to this round or really any round is to win as often as possible to keep your competitors out. Everyone is fast in the Chase right now, right? Everyone has got a lot of speed in their cars. Everyone is running up front at points during the race. Really, for us it's just about winning trophies. We don't have to think too much deeper than that, it's just we want to go win the race.” \nSo as usual, there is no fact in these sorts of racing circumstance, just vantage points. James: Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s title hopes come down to Talladega \nAnd from Logano’s perspective, whether he truly meant to wreck Kenseth — and he’s not admitting it if he did — he did what needed to be done for himself and his team. He did what he should have done as dictated by the provocative new postseason format NASCAR unveiled last season. \nRules of engagement and shades of decorum are different. And even if it truly didn’t figure in the high-speed calculus entering Turn 1, Logano may have eliminated one of the biggest threats to his bid for a championship. And that’s his job and his prerogative under the current code. \nFor Kenseth, though, a line had been crossed. \n“He just plain wrecked me,” he said on pit road. “He cries on his radio a lot, I guess, about blocking or moving around, but man, you’re leading the race, you can pick whatever lane you want. It’s not like he was alongside of me. To wreck somebody for wanting to be in a lane you wanted to be in seems kind of risky and not very smart, but that’s the decision he made.” \nPHOTOS: 2015 Chase drivers, rankings and points", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:02:40.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
