(AP) - Trevone Boykin threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns, the second a 55-yard strike to Josh Doctson with 1:10 left in the game, and second-ranked TCU rallied from a big halftime deficit to beat Kansas State 52-45 on Saturday night.\nBoykin also ran for 124 yards and two scores for the Horned Frogs (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who trailed 35-17 at the break. Aaron Green added 124 yards and two touchdowns rushing, while Doctson caught eight passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns.\nNone was bigger than his catch-and-run just 30 seconds after Jack Cantele had connected on a 37-yard field goal for Kansas State (3-2, 0-2) to knot the game 45-all.\nThe Wildcats had won 49 straight games when leading at halftime before last week's loss at Oklahoma State. Now, coach Bill Snyder's crew has lost two in a row.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
