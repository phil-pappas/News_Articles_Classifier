People just don’t understand.\"\nUtley, a 12-year veteran and six-time All-Star while with the Philadelphia Phillies now reduced to a part-time role with the Dodgers, has always been fierce competitor and as a second baseman himself knows both sides of the issue.\nIn a critical seventh-inning play that helped turn a 2-1 deficit into a 5-2 Dodgers' lead, Utley started his slide late and came in high at the legs of Tejada, whose back was turned as he received an off-line toss from second baseman Daniel Murphy.\nUtley crashed into Tejada late and high into his legs causing a somersault and the crushing injury.\nBaseball has never been a genteel game, its early heroes like Ty Cobb renowned for aggressive play, the image of Cobb sliding with sharpened spikes high into third base a classic photo from the day.\nOther All-Stars over the years also personified the hard-nosed approach including Jackie Robinson, Hal McRae and Pete Rose, who got into a scuffle with Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson during the 1973 NL Championship Series after an attempt to break up a double play.\nRose was subsequently pelted by New York fans with debris from beer cans to batteries, and had a whiskey bottle thrown at him in left field before Reds manager Sparky Anderson temporarily pulled his team off the field for their safety.\n\"It's the kind of deal where if you're Utley's teammates, you give him a high-five,\" Rose told Newsday about the aggressive play. \"And if you're the Mets, you're mad and you can't wait to get even with him somehow.\"\nRose, an analyst for Fox Sports' pregame show, cautioned against changing things too much.\n\"We can't pitch inside; now we won't be able to break up double plays?\" he said. \"What's baseball coming to?\"\n(Editing by Frank Pingue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:02:47.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
