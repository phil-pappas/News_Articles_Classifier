Source: AFP\nThe former NRL star’s first punt return began well enough as he avoided a number of Ravens defenders with some fancy footwork.\nBut a tackle from behind from Baltimore’s Anthony Levine resulted in him spilling the ball for the third time in Hayne’s budding NFL career.\nLuckily, it wasn’t costly as the 49ers recovered the ball and went on to score the opening points of the match, but Hayne admitted it was another incident he needed to learn from.\n“I was obviously devastated with the fumble,” Hayne told reporters.\n“We always talk about it; ‘the most dangerous man is the man you don’t see’\n“I’m sure I’ll be asked about that during the week and for me, I kind of felt like behind was clear and I went for that little bit extra.\nSan Francisco 49ers back in winner's circle 0:58 NFL: Jarryd Hayne's 49ers defeated Baltimore 25-20 at Levi's Stadium, but the former Parramatta star made another forgettable fumble.\nOctober 19th 2015 2 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/More Sports/ “I knew if I beat that one guy and the guy wasn’t behind me, it was just me and the punter and the (blocking) boys were there.\n“It’s obviously one of those things you’ve got to learn from. The most important thing is protecting the ball.”\nHayne’s only other touch was fair catch late in the first half. He lined up at running back a handful of times but didn’t get a touch, with his effectiveness in a blocking role also coming under scrutiny.\nHayne also took the field for a late kickoff return but again didn’t get his hands on the ball as the Ravens continued to put kicks over the end zone.\nA second-half injury to Hyde — who shouldered the bulk of running back duties despite his foot problem — looked like it could open the door for Hayne but Hyde was able to continue.\nJarryd Hayne returns a punt against the Baltimore Ravens.
