Every four years Les Bleus seem to flick the switch to show the world they are not such a bad rugby team after all.\nWhile France has never won the Webb Ellis Cup it has made three finals — 1987, 1999 and 2011 — and has never failed to make the quarterfinals.\nIt is some feat considering in 2007, as hosts, it lost the opening match to Argentina and in 2011 it lost pool matches to New Zealand and Tonga when in-fighting was rife and there was a mutiny against the coach at the time, Marc Lièvremont.\nFrance has also been involved in some of the tournament’s most exhilarating matches, particularly the 1999 semifinal when it came from 24-10 down to stun tournament favorites New Zealand 43-31.\nIt heaped further misery on New Zealand in 2007 when it won the quarterfinal in Cardiff 20-18 to condemn the All Blacks to their earliest ever exit at a World Cup.\nYet in between rugby’s showpiece events the French have repeatedly underperformed.\nSince its 8-7 loss to New Zealand in the 2011 final in Auckland, the French have finished fourth (2012, 2014 and 2015) and sixth (2013) in the Six Nations tournament that also involves England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy.\nThey have been underwhelming in the annual June and November test series in the intervening years too.\nCoach Philippe Saint-André used 82 players in his 40 tests in charge prior to this World Cup, something not out of the ordinary for the French. Lièvremont used 82 players in his 38 tests prior to the 2011 World Cup, while Bernard Laporte picked 89 players in 42 matches between the 2003 and 2007 World Cups and 95 in 42 tests between the 1999 and 2003 tournaments.\nSaint-André’s rotating of players during the past four years has also included 17 different scrumhalf/flyhalf combinations.\nYet for all the disappointing results and mediocre performances prior to this year’s World Cup, France once again has reached the knockout phase with victories against Italy, Romania and Canada.\nThe mercurial flyhalf Frédéric Michalak, 32, has rolled back the years and showcased his vast array of skills after being given a second chance by Saint-André. He has sparked the French attack and has become the first-choice No.10 in the process.\nThe forward pack, too, is showing more willingness to engage in the battle at the scrums and the breakdown, something that has not always been evident in recent years.\nWhile it has not all been smooth sailing — footage of Saint-André’s furious dressing down of his players at halftime during the match against Romania went viral — the French have again shown they are a team to be reckoned with.\nThe biggest test of the tournament for Les Bleus so far, though, will be Sunday, when they take on the two-time Six Nations champions Ireland, the only other unbeaten team in their pool.\nThe match will determine which team faces likely qualifiers from pool C, New Zealand or Argentina.\nIf France, which has lost its past two tests against the Irish, wins Sunday then it will play the runner-up in pool C, expected to be Argentina, in the quarterfinal. If it loses then New Zealand awaits in Cardiff, Wales, in a repeat of the 2007 quarterfinal.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Ireland flyhalf Johnny Sexton got an insight into the French psyche about the World Cup while playing for two years at Top 14 club Racing Metro.\n“What I did get from them is the World Cup is huge over there, the Six Nations is almost like a burden on them in the middle of the Top 14 season. It disrupts their year,” he told Reuters.\n“It’s almost like they build for this and use players throughout the Six Nations year-on-year to have this big playing pool for the World Cup,” he said. “You can see it from their previous results. Arguably, they should have won the last World Cup so we’ve got to be aware of all these things.”\nJust as Ireland and France will want to avoid defending champion New Zealand in the last eight, Australia and Wales will be keen to avoid two-time champions South Africa in the quarterfinals.\nThe Springboks got off to a rocky start with a shock defeat to Japan in their first match but have rebounded well to top pool B.\nTheir forward play has always been a strength, but in their victories against Scotland and the United States the backs showed their cutting edge, which has been sparked by the play of the two centers, Jesse Kriel and Damian de Allende.\nWhile Australia has enjoyed recent Rugby Championship success against South Africa, it would much prefer to face lower-ranked teams Scotland or Japan — who are in a battle for the runner-up spot in pool B — in the quarterfinals.\nLikewise Wales, whose history against Southern Hemisphere teams does not make for pleasant reading. It lost nine successive tests against the Springboks under Coach Warren Gatland before last November’s 12-6 victory in Cardiff.\nBut its record against Australia is not good either, and it will need to beat the odds on Saturday if it is to top pool A. Wales has lost the past 10 tests to the Wallabies, including the bronze medal match at the 2011 World Cup. The only victory against Australia under Gatland was in 2008.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:21:55.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
