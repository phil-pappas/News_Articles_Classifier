The pianist works hard to build a program that has something for everybody. She means everybody.\n“It’s important that if you go to a concert and you may love Beethoven, it would also be nice if you can have a little bit of variety. Different people have different tastes,” Mahan said in a phone interview from her home in Denver.\nThe program of her Oct. 25 Placitas Artists Series concert is a good example of appealing to a cross-section of listeners. The concert opens with Claude Debussy’s “Estampes” and “L’isle joyeuse.”\n“I’m starting with Debussy because he’s one of my specialities,” Mahan said. “I studied for three years with the French pianist Pascal Rogé. With him I did the complete piano works of Debussy. So Debussy is a passion and a speciality.”\nIf you go\nWHAT: Pianist Katie Mahan\nWHEN: 3 p.m. Oct. 25\nWHERE: Las Placitas Presbyterian Church, six miles east of Interstate 25 on N.M. 165 in Placitas\nHOW MUCH: $20 general public in advance at placitasarts.org , at The Merc Grocery Store, Homestead Village Shopping Plaza in Placitas or at Uncle Charlie’s Covers bookstore, 160 S. Camino del Pueblo, Bernalillo, or at the door. $15 students with ID at the door. Music students through high school free with paying adult “Estampes,” the first Debussy work that Mahan ever played, is a series of images including an evening in a Spanish town and a garden in France. To her, it is the most audience-friendly of Debussy’s suites.\nAfter Debussy, Mahan will play two Beethoven piano sonatas – No. 21 (“Waldstein”) and No. 23 (“Appassionata”).\n“Why did I pair them? They show completely opposite sides of Beethoven’s personality,” she said. “To me, it’s miraculous how two pieces of music from the same period in his life show such different characters and moods.”\nThe “Waldstein,” Mahan said, is so uplifting and enlightening that listeners can imagine being transported to heaven.\nThe “Appassionata” reveals the composer’s “true character. It’s a great autobiographical work. … It’s a very deep, dramatic work and this more perfectly describes him than his other piano sonatas,” she said.\nClosing the concert, and enhancing the program’s variety, is Mahan’s own arrangement of George Gershwin’s famous “Rhapsody in Blue.” Her arrangement merges the orchestral and the two-piano versions so that the solo piano doesn’t sound as empty as other solo performances.\n“I’ve tried to make the texture fuller, with more colors,” she said. “This is one of the pieces I play, that no matter what continent, people love to hear. It’s exciting, uniquely American.”\nMahan, a Steinway artist, is planning two recording projects next year. In March, she is going into the studio to record an all-Gershwin CD that includes “Rhapsody in Blue.” Two months later, she is schedule to record a CD of George Gershwin and Sergei Rachmaninoff concertos.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life08_jd_18oct_placitas-640x528.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:20:14.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
