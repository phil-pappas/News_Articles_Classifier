We hope to start this week or next week.\"\nThe July agreement won final approval in Iran on Wednesday.\nIn Tehran, some hardline lawmakers say Rouhani's government made too many concessions to the West. The deal also came despite fierce opposition from US and Israeli critics who say safeguards on Iran are not sufficiently robust.\nIran has always denied seeking a nuclear weapon. The accord is meant to ensure it never can through an inspection regime over 15 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:10:33.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
