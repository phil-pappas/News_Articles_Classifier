That's because they believe their dogs were purposely poisoned. It happened near West 39th Street and West Avenue. When they came home Tuesday, they found one of their dogs lying in the back yard dead and the other is now being cared for by a veterinarian. \nMegan Struwe is holding her miniature dachshund, Turbo, a little closer after she believes someone intentionally poisoned him and her other dachshund Ziggy, who died. \n\"It makes you frustrated and angry, makes you wonder who would do something like that to an innocent animal,\" Struwe said. \n\"That's the hardest I ever cried in my life,\" Derek Rondeau said. \nDerek Rondeau is the one who found Ziggy dead by the back door. But that's not all he found. Rondeau also located an empty bologna package. \n\"After looking at it a little closer, I could see there was rat poison pellets on the container, which was mixed with ketchup or barbeque sauce,\" Rondeau said. \nThere's still evidence of the rat poison in his back yard. Rondeau and Struwe took Turbo and the package laced with pellets to the veterinarian. \n\"As soon as I brought it in they said, 'Yeah that's rat poison,\" Rondeau said. \nRight now they're not sure who or why anyone would want to poison their dogs or anyone else's pets, but they want to warn others to keep an eye on them. \n\"It's not something you ever want to come home and find,\" Struwe said. \nThankfully Turbo, who is still hooked up to an IV, is going to be okay, but Rondeau and Struwe are left with a $2,000 vet bill and a feeling of finding justice for both Turbo and Ziggy. \n\"I'm eventually going to pay to have an autopsy done to figure out an exact cause, so if they find the person or persons who did it, they can be prosecuted to the fullest extent,\" Rondeau said. \nSioux Falls Animal Control is investigating the case. \nRondeau and Struwe believe this isn't the first time their dogs were poisoned. Two weeks ago they had to take Ziggy into the vet because he was convulsing. \nThere's a GoFundMe page set up for anyone to make a donation to help the couple pay for their vet bill and possibly to offer a reward to anyone with information that will lead to an arrest.
