There are good times, there are bad times and you need to learn how to deal with it,\" Robshaw said. \n\"You need to know what's happening, absorb it and use it. That's the best way. You want to go out and prove a couple of people wrong. \n\"As a team it brings you closer together. You find out about the character of the individuals around you, how much you mean to each other and how much people outside mean to you. \n\"That's when you really see a team form, there's a unity in it. We've got ourselves in the best possible frame of mind to deliver and now we need to.\" \nThe good news for England is they can still put themselves into a strong position to qualify with a win over the Wallabies on Saturday and Robshaw says that it is an opportunity he and his team-mates are determined to take. \n\"We have an option. We can change things this weekend or we can let it linger,\" he added. \"As players we have to front up and change things. There is no point dwelling on it. \n\"Last weekend was heartbreaking and devastating. We let things get away from us, but in sport a week can be a long time. We have got that chance on Saturday to put it right. \n\"It's knock-out rugby. There's no second chance. It's all on the line. We know that.\" \nIf England fail to beat Australia they will become the first World Cup hosts in tournament history not to reach the quarter-finals.
