But on Monday, Jason, of Brick Township, was transferred to Children’s Specialized Hospital in New Brunswick to start his rehabilitation. That process will eventually include getting fitted for a prosthesis for normal activities as well as a special one to use on the pitcher’s mound, according to his father, a chiropractor.\n“With prostheses today, as long as he’s willing to push through, yeah, he can absolutely pitch,” Anthony Criscuolo said. “The technology they have today for these prosthetics, there’s no limits.”\nSo far, Jason’s family and supporters have raised $41,000 online at GoFundMe.com for the pitching prosthesis, the father said. The special prosthesis costs about $50,000 and must be replaced every few years.\nWhile some young athletes might be distraught and depressed after an amputation, and consider it an end to their sports activity, Jason is undaunted, spurred on in part by his coaches, including Rich Martin at Ramapo, and teammates. The team and coach visited Jason at the hospital this past weekend.\n“His goal is to pitch,” Anthony Criscuolo said. “He’s not going to do it this coming season, but we’re going to rehab him and get him ready. The coach even made a players’ card for the first game of the 2017 Ramapo season, and there’s a lineup and it has him as the pitcher. That’s his goal.”\nJason, a freshman who was recruited by Ramapo and was already playing baseball there, was attempting to cross Route 17 shortly before 8 p.m. on Sept. 27 when he was hit by a pickup. Through a series of fortunate turns of events — including the quick work of Mahwah Police Officer Matt Lombardo, who applied a tourniquet to stanch the bleeding — Jason survived. Because of a severe leg injury, his left foot and ankle were amputated at St. Joseph’s, and he remained on a ventilator for eight days, heavily sedated.\nAnthony Criscuolo said his son, who was not available for comment on Monday, was crossing the busy, dark highway to get dinner at a McDonald’s.\n“He was just going across to get something to eat,” the father said. “He was with some friends watching football. Nobody else wanted anything to eat, and he was just hungry and was heading to McDonald’s. … Apparently there’s an easier path but he didn’t inquire about it, and he tried to cross right over 17.”\nAn emergency medical technician was driving behind the pickup that hit Criscuolo, and he and the pickup driver stopped and administered aid to Jason. Then Lombardo arrived at the scene and applied a tourniquet to Jason’s left leg, and a state police helicopter flew him to St. Joseph’s. On Sunday, Lombardo went to St. Joseph’s to meet Jason, his father, his mother, Lisa, and his 22-year-old sister, Julia.\nAnthony Criscuolo had previously spoken to Lombardo to thank him over the phone. He recalled that when he arrived at the St. Joseph’s emergency room the night of the accident, Dr. Robert Madlinger told him that whoever applied the tourniquet to Jason’s leg had stopped him from bleeding to death at the scene.\nLombardo, the 27-year-old son of retired Ringwood Police Chief Bernie Lombardo, said he enjoyed meeting the ballplayer and his grateful family.\n“It was great seeing him,” Lombardo said Monday. “He was making jokes. He was definitely very optimistic about the recovery process and excited to get into rehab and ready to try to get back on the field pitching again. … It was a little emotional, but at the same time his upbeat attitude really kind of set the tone for the meeting.”\nJason, who doesn’t remember the accident, asked for details after thanking Lombardo, his father said.\n“My son wanted to know what really happened because he hadn’t seen the accident report,” Criscuolo said.\nHe also described Lombardo as “too humble and modest, because he said he was only doing his job.”\nRamapo plans to honor Lombardo by having him throw out the first pitch at the baseball season opener next spring, according to a college spokeswoman.\nJason, a former star athlete at St. Rose High School in Belmar, could have his final walking prosthesis in three to six months because he is so young and in such great physical shape, his father said. It would take an average person nine months to a year, he said. Insurance will cover the walking prosthesis, but not the one for pitching, the father said.\nCriscuolo pointed out that people with prostheses participate in Ironman competitions and have even pitched in the Major Leagues. He also noted that Jason benefits because he still has his full right leg to “push off” for pitching, and that his partial left leg is his “stride” leg.\nJason’s high school coach, Mike Condon, visited him last week at St. Joseph’s. Condon, who said Jason has a great split-finger fastball, said he was nervous about how his former player’s mood would be. His fears were unwarranted.\n“You just knew that there’s this calming presence that he had,” Conlon said. “He realized what the situation was and had already switched a switch to ask what’s the remedy, how are we going forward.”\nConlon said Jason told him, “This just makes me realize that I want to do so much more with my life,” and that he was saved for a special purpose.\nJason, a surfer and snowboarder, is planning to take Ramapo courses online and then return to campus next September, his father said.\n“The first few days, obviously, anybody hears the word ‘amputation’ — every relative just about buckled at the knees,” he said. But, he added, “as bad as this is, we’re blessed, and we realize that.”\nEmail: moss@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:25:57.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
