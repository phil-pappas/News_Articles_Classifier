Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (6) If Davis manages to win its second straight Class 5A soccer title by beating Weber on Friday at Rio Tinto Stadium, the Darts could make an argument for being the best in Utah history. Consider that the 19-0 Darts are ranked sixth nationally in the most recent USA Today poll. They have 10 players with Division I college scholarship offers. Star players Ireland Dunn and Olivia Wade have played on U.S. national age group teams. Davis' season statistics are also impressive. The Darts have outscored opponents 108-8. Everyone talks about their offense, but the defense has been keeping them in some tight, as goalkeepers Kendyl Baker and Abbie O'Brien have had some good games this season. VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs That said, this has not been an easy state tournament for Davis, which needed overtime to defeat American Fork and made a 1-0 lead on a goal by Wade in the first 90 seconds hold up through some tense moments in a semifinal win against Fremont. What's more, Weber was the last team to beat the Darts. That came in October 2014 when the two schools played in what was then Region 1. The Warriors finished second to Fremont in Region 1 this year. They are 16-2-1 on the season with losses to Mountain Crest and Fremont. They come into the game on a six-game winning streak, with goalkeeper Hannah Johnson making some big saves. The Class 4A title game at Rio Tinto marks the third time in as many years Skyline and Timpanogos have played each other, with the Timberwolves winning the past two. The Eagles were expected to be in the title game after completing a 17-1-1 season and winning the Region 6 title. They had just one bad week, getting tied by Olympus and defeated by Murray. Skyline seniors such as Emma Heyn, Bella Sorensen and Holly Daugirda have been part of those two title-game losses and will be coming into this one motivated. Timpanogos wasn't expected to be a title factor after finishing third in tough Region 7. The Timberwolves own a proud tradition, however, and come into the game with a five-game winning streak and a 9-5-3 overall record. They are led by Jadie Christensen. Meanwhile, the Class 3A and 2A girls' soccer semifinals are scheduled for Friday at Jordan High. In 3A, Logan tests Desert Hills at 3:45 p.m. and Cedar meets Snow Canyon at 6 p.m. Class 2A contests see defending champion Rowland Hall battling Millard at 11 a.m. and Manti meeting Maeser at 1:15. The Class 3A title game is at 4:30 Saturday at Rio Tinto Stadium, while the 2A crown will be decided at 2 p.m., also at Rio Tinto.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:49:48.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
