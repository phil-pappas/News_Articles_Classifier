They appeared Tuesday in Tuolumne County Superior Court. The teens were arrested earlier this month after an investigation by the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office found what was believed to be written plans and a list of targets, Sheriff James Mele has said. Each teen faces eight felony counts of conspiracy to commit great bodily harm. The case has been assigned to Judge James A. Boscoe. Two families will fight the court’s decision to detain their sons. Hearings for those cases have been scheduled for Friday morning. The other two families are agreeing with the court’s decision for now, and further detention hearings for those teens will be scheduled for later this month, said District Attorney Laura Krieg. There is no way to establish a timeline for the case, Krieg said, but she will continue to advocate for the teens to remain in custody for the time being. She has requested psychiatric evaluations from the FBI for each. Krieg said the court must determine where the boys will be placed before prosecution begins. Each is being held at an undisclosed juvenile facility outside the county. The court appearance Tuesday was the second to determine whether the teens would be released. While some parents climbed hand-in-hand up Yaney Street, others appeared with extended family. The families were present inside the courtroom, which has been closed to the public to protect the minors’ identities. One of the students has drawn weekly support at the hearings. The group that last week waited anxiously outside the locked doors returned with two more neighbors. Conall Brown, 18, who rode the bus home from Pinecrest Elementary School with the student, said the two would spend afternoons playing fantasy games. “I just tried to be there for him…I feel bad I didn’t do more,” Brown said. It was hard to connect with the student, he said, because of the age difference between them, and the boy was always a little “socially inept,” Brown said. Brown entered independent study after eighth grade and had not seen the student much since. When asked if the student was capable of carrying out the shooting, Brown said he was unsure. “He was at a different school — more kids, more negative influences. I can’t really speculate,” he said. “I knew him as a happy fourth grader.” Carolyn Barrett, who attended last week’s hearing, was back Tuesday. As the boys were ushered to a white van to return to juvenile hall, she held up a sign written in Pig Latin that translated to “My hovercraft is full of eels.” The slogan comes from a Monty Python’s Flying Circus skit, a favorite television show Barrett would watch with her neighbor.
