It is expected to attract a capacity crowd of 40,000. \nA Canadian Football League source confirmed to the Sun on Wednesday morning that the game will be held on Nov. 27, 2016, four years after the CFL chose Toronto to host the league's 100th championship game. \nMLSE is in the midst of a $120-million renovation that has already expanded BMO Field by 8,000 seats. \nPhase II of the project is underway and will see BMO Field covered by roofing on three sides. \nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman in July would not rule out BMO Field as a possible host site for the 2016-17 Winter Classic outdoor game. \nThat year is the 100th anniversary of the Toronto Maple Leafs franchise. \n\"We'll have to see,\" Bettman told the Sun at the time about BMO Field's future chances of staging an outdoor NHL game. \"It's not a no, it's not a yes. It's, 'We'll have to see.' \n\"We haven't focused on the outdoor games for the season after this. But if BMO is ready for an outdoor game, and the Leafs want us to take a look at it, we'll take a look.\" \nThe Toronto Argonauts are scheduled to move into BMO Field in time for the start of next season as part of a deal that saw MLSE chairman Larry Tanenbaum and Bell purchase the team in May. \nThe Grey Cup could conflict with Major League Soccer's playoffs should Toronto FC advance as far as the Eastern Conference final in 2016.
