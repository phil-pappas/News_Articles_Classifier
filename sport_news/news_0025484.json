These guys here, they're comfortable and we've definitely got the crowd behind us,\" outfielder Ben Revere said Sunday. \"We definitely feel much more comfortable being back at home.\"\nAfter Kansas City took the first two games at home, Game 3 is in Toronto tonight. First pitch is set for 8:07 p.m. The Blue Jays' Marcus Stroman faces Kansas City's Johnny Cueto in a matchup of two Division Series Game 5 starters.\n\"This series is not over, not even close,\" defending AL champion Royals center fielder Lorenzo Cain said after testing the bounce of the turf and the glare of the light in the closed-roofed stadium.\nThe Blue Jays advanced to the ALCS with a win that featured one of the most bizarre innings in postseason history. Bautista capped that seventh inning with a monster home run — and equally big bat toss.\nThat was the last long ball the top slugging team in baseball this year has hit.\nIn the chilly air of Kansas City, the Blue Jays scored just three runs and went deep none.\nNow, they are more than ready to play in front of another raucous crowd that has filled their ballpark — and got rowdy in the deciding Game 5 against Texas. So much so, security should be beefed up for the ALCS.\nNo more deep alleys of Kauffman Stadium where their drives died. No more unfriendly fans who played tricks with Ryan Goins on the fly ball that changed the tenor of Game 2, setting off a five-run rally that led to a 6-3 come-from-behind win for the Royals.\n\"Kansas City's park is really big,\" Revere said. \"Some of the balls we were hitting there, they were going nowhere. Now we're back home, some of those balls that were crushed are going to go over the heads or go in the gaps more.\"\nYOUNG GETS GAME 4 NOD: Royals manager Ned Yost has chosen Chris Young over Kris Medlen as his starter for Game 4.\nYoung has only made two starts since July 28, but they were good ones. He allowed one run in 11 1/3 innings over those two outings, with his final start coming Oct. 2.\nYoung faced the Blue Jays once this year, a 7-5 loss on July 11. Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run shot and Young yielded five hits and three runs over six innings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:46.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
