(AP Photo/David J. Phillip) \nThe Bucs like what they saw in Jameis Winston during Week 3 against the Texans. He set career highs with 36 passing attempts, 17 completions and 261 yards. \n“ Jameis Winston is a good football player, simple as that ,” Coach Lovie Smith said. “He’ll have some bad plays like all quarterbacks do, but his arrow is pointed up.” \nThose “bad plays” are occurring mostly on third down, where the rookie quarterback went 2 for 2 for 31 yards and an interception last week. Winston has also struggled on his throws within 15 yards, resulting in a 51.5 percent completion rate, the lowest mark in the league.

Brown (@smartfootball) September 30, 2015 \nHe is also focusing too much on receiver Mike Evans, targeting him 17 times in Week 3 but only completing seven of those. If Winston makes it that easy for opposing defense, his struggles to produce fantasy points will continue. \nThis week’s opponent, the Carolina Panthers, have allowed the second fewest net yards per pass attempt (5.0) and just 57.5 yards per game to the opposition’s top wideout , making this a tough spot for Winston to produce.
