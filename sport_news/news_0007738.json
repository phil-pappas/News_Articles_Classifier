Clark: Can FSU bounce back from this? \n“It took me a minute because I thought it was over,” Gamble said. I thought the play was dead. I started celebrating. I was celebrating and yelling. And then I heard the crowd first. I was like, wait. I looked back and (Austin) was taking off.” \nAdded Aguayo, who was FSU’s last hope on the play before Austin reached the end zone: “I think a lot of their guys and our guys thought it was dead. We tried to get (Austin) down and couldn’t.’ ” \nThe play will be a lasting memory for both teams as the Yellow Jackets (3-5, 1-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) avenged last season’s ACC title game loss while snapping the Seminoles’ (6-1, 4-1) 28-game conference winning streak. No. 9 FSU falls 22-16 at Georgia Tech in dramatic fashion \n“As a coach, you have to go through that, and we have to learn from that,” FSU head coach Jimbo Fisher said after the game. “Like a win, after 24 hours, we have to get our mistakes corrected and we move on. \n“We can’t let one loss become two.” \nThe Seminoles dropped eight spots in the Associated Press Top 25 poll to No. 17 and six spots in the Amway Coaches’ Poll to No. 15 after the loss. \nFSU will host Syracuse (3-4, 1-2) at noon on Saturday in Doak Campbell Stadium. Two of Syracuse’s losses this season came at USF — a team FSU beat at home earlier this season — and at home to LSU.
