Reports say the simian population in the state capital has registered an increase with eight localities being identified as hot spots with high monkey concentration. The results of the latest monkey census undertaken in July earlier this year has indicated that there are about 2,452 monkeys within the municipal limits, which is higher than their number reflected in the last census undertaken in 2013. The monkey figures for the rest of the state are still being compiled by the wildlife wing of the Forest Department to get maximum possible accuracy. The Wildlife Department has already moved a case to the Centre for declaring monkeys within Shimla Municipal Corporation (MC) as vermins so that they can be scientifically eliminated and their increasing number controlled. The response from the Centre on the proposal sent on September 12, 2015 is still awaited. Sources said that the eight forest beats of Jakhu, Summer Hill, Glen, Kaithu, Khalini, Fagli, Tuti Kandi and Bharari had been declared as problematic areas. A total of 296 persons, including many children, have become victims of monkey bites during the last three years. A total of Rs 19.74 lakh has been disbursed as relief on account of the monkey bites. The monkey figure for Shimla indicates that their estimated density is about 0.75 group per sq kms, which is very high. “This means that there is at least one troupe of monkeys in each sq km with each troupe having about 30 monkeys,” said a forest official. He added that studies had indicated that the home range size of any monkey in Shimla is about five sq kms. The latest figures of the census undertaken in July 2015 are being considered quite accurate as the entire process has been undertaken in a very scientific method under the guidance of experts. The high concentration of monkeys in the town here has become a major cause of concern with school children and women finding it extremely difficult to venture out as they are more vulnerable to simian attacks. It is under Section 62 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 that the monkeys can be declared as vermins and killed. The various options to check their growing number is to undertake scientific culling, export them for laboratory testing of drugs or sterilize them. Despite the wildlife wing running eight sterilization centres in the state and sterilizing over 98,000 monkeys till now, there has been no reduction in the number of attacks by monkeys. The eight sterilization centres functioning in the state are located at Tutikandi (Shimla), Sastar (Hamirpur), Gopalpur (Kangra), Baul (Una), Sarol (Chamba), Sapalar (Mandi), Paonta Sahib (Sirmaur) and Ispur (Una). Work on making the ninth sterilization centre at Kania Nullah in Sainj area of Kullu is still underway. The loss caused by monkeys to crops and fruits runs into several crores and in several places like Kullu, Solan, Mandi and Sirmaur farmers have given up cultivation of maize and vegetables.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:06:42.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
