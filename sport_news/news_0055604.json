He did not clarify whether the number of dead included the gunman. \nEarlier, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said 13 people were killed. It was unclear what led to the discrepancy. \n\"It's been a terrible day,\" a grim-faced Hanlin said. \"Certainly this is a huge shock to our community.\" \nHours after the attack, a visibly angry President Barack Obama spoke to reporters at the White House, saying the U.S. is becoming numb to mass shootings and that the shooters have \"sickness\" in their minds. \nRepeating his support for tighter gun-control measures, the president said thoughts and prayers are no longer enough in such situations because they do nothing to stop similar attacks from happening a few weeks or months later. He challenged voters wanting to confront the problem to vote for elected officials who will act. \nPolice began receiving calls about a campus shooting at 10:38 a.m. The school has a single unarmed security guard. \nKortney Moore, 18, said she was in a freshman writing class when a shot came through the window and hit the teacher in the head. \nThe gunman then entered the Snyder Hall classroom and told people to get on the floor, she told the Roseburg News-Review newspaper. He told people to stand up and state their religion before opening fire. \nNext door, students heard a loud thud and then a volley of gunfire, Brady Winder, 23, told the newspaper. \nStudents scrambled \"like ants, people screaming, 'Get out!'\" Winder said. He said one woman swam across a creek to get away. \nThe sheriff said officers had a shootout with the gunman, but it was not clear if he was killed by authorities or whether he took his own life. \nThe gunfire sparked panic as students ran for safety and police and ambulances rushed to the scene. \nLorie Andrews, who lives across the street from the campus, heard what sounded like fireworks and then saw police cruisers streaming in. She spoke with students as they left. \n\"One girl came out wrapped in a blanket with blood on her,\" she said. \nSome students were in tears as they left. Police lined up students in a parking lot with their hands over their heads and searched them before they were bused with faculty to the nearby county fairgrounds, where counselors were available and some parents waited for their children. \nJessica Chandler of Myrtle Creek, south of Roseburg, was at the fairgrounds desperately seeking information about her 18-year-old daughter, Rebecka Carnes. \n\"I don't know where she is. I don't know if she's wounded. I have no idea where she's at,\" Chandler said. \nCarnes' best friend told Chandler that her daughter had been flown by helicopter to a hospital, but she had not been able to find her at area medical centers. \nInterim college President Rita Cavin said it was awful to watch families waiting for the last bus of survivors and their loved ones were not on it. \n\"This is a tragedy and an anomaly,\" she said. \"We have a wonderful, warm, loving and friendly campus.\" \nThe sheriff described the town of 22,000 as a peaceful community that has crime like any other. In fact, it's no stranger to school gun violence. A freshman at the local high school shot and wounded a fellow student in 2006. \nThe sheriff has been vocal in opposing state and federal gun-control legislation. Earlier this year, he testified against a bill to require background checks on private, person-to-person gun sales and told a legislative committee in March that a background-check mandate would not prevent criminals from getting firearms. \nHe said the state should combat gun violence by cracking down on convicted criminals found with guns, and by addressing people with unmanaged mental health problems. \nIn 2013, Hanlin also sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school, declaring that he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions \"offending the constitutional rights of my citizens.\" \nBefore the shooting, a posting on the message-board site 4chan included a photo of a crudely drawn frog used regularly in Internet memes with a gun and warned other users not to go to school Thursday in the Northwest. The messages that followed spoke of mass shootings, with some egging on and even offering tips to the original poster. It's unclear if the messages are tied to the shooting because of the largely anonymous nature of the site. \nThe community along Interstate 5 west of the Cascade Mountains is in an area where the timber industry has struggled. In recent years, officials have tried to promote the region as a tourist destination for vineyards and outdoor activities. \nMany of the students in local school district go on to attend the college of 3,000 students. \n\"We are a small, tight community, and there is no doubt that we will have staff and students that have family and friends impacted by this event,\"Roseburg Public Schools Superintendent Gerry Washburn said. \nFormer UCC President Joe Olson, who retired in June after four years, said the school had no formal security staff, just one officer on a shift. \nOne of the biggest debates on campus last year was whether to post armed security officers on campus to respond to a shooting. \n\"I suspect this is going to start a discussion across the country about how community colleges prepare themselves for events like this,\" he said. \nThere were no immediate plans to upgrade security on the campus in light of the shooting, Cavin said.
