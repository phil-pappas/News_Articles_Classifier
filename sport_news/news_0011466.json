He was also the runner-up in the PGA Championship, tied for fourth at The Open Championship and was named PGA Tour Player of the Year. “Playing in the Singapore Open is something I’m really looking forward to. I’m very fortunate to play golf around the world and can’t wait to visit Singapore for the first time,” said Spieth, who was part of the United States team that recently claimed The Presidents Cup.\nEnthusiastic galleries are expected when Spieth graces The Serapong Course at Sentosa Golf Club for the January 28-31 tournament in 2016. With a minimum prize purse of $1 million, the event will be jointly sanctioned by the Asian Tour and the Japan Golf Tour Organisation (JGTO). Spieth’s inclusion in the field along with the backing of new title sponsor Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) will see the tournament return after a three-year absence.\nHe will be trying to add his name to a list of illustrious champions, including three-time winner Adam Scott of Australia, England’s Ian Poulter, Angel Cabrera of Argentina and Matteo Manassero of Italy, who triumphed in 2012.\n“I know the Singapore Open is one of Asia’s leading events and I couldn’t be more excited to add it to my 2016 playing schedule,” said Spieth. Spieth’s four-stroke victory in the Masters and one-shot win at the US Open set up the possibility of the Texan becoming the first player in the modern era to complete the Grand Slam in a single season. He also came within a few inches of making the play-off at The Open Championship in July.\nAlthough, his birdie putt from the Valley of Sin at St. Andrews stopped short, Spieth’s Major ambitions were not over for the year. He played some of his best golf at Whistling Straits in the PGA Championship before finishing in second place behind Australia’s Jason Day. The runner-up finish was good enough to take him to top spot on the Official World Golf Rankings, fulfilling a lifelong dream. Spieth also won the Valspar Championship in March and the John Deere Classic in July. The Singapore Open will feature the top-60 from the Asian Tour, top-60 from the JGTO, leading Singapore professionals and amateurs and invites including players from the top-50 in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:57:30.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
