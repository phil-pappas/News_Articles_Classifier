Waukee is winners of four titles in the last six years. \nWaukee, which led by only one stroke over Dowling Catholic after the first round Friday, won by eight strokes over Ankeny Centennial in what proved to be a blowout. \n“The first day was probably the most important part of this,” Waukee coach John Kotz said. “That’s the deal with the first day. You can’t win it the first day, but you can lose it. We put ourselves in a good spot. Today was about hanging on.” \nSenior Tripp Kinney led the way for Waukee on Saturday, carding a 76. Junior Andrew O’Brien shot a 78, senior Colby Nicodemus shot a 79 and senior Tom McLaughlin shot an 80. \nKinney finished second overall on the individual leaderboard and O’Brien was third. West Des Moines Valley’s Ben Epperly won the meet. \n“We can’t control anybody else,” Kotz said. “It was all about control and what we’re going to do. We needed to stay in our game. We got away from that a little bit today, but we sunk back in the latter part of the round.” \nAs the team began to gather following the announcement of the state title, a Waukee player dragged a big, blue cooler towards the group. \nLet the celebration — again — ensue. \n“We’re about to pop some sparkling water,” Kinney said. “Everybody on the team pushed each other to be better, and it worked out in the end.\" 2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1RAhOvg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:38:49.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
