(AP) - Since 2008, state officials say Madison County has been illegally collecting excess ad valorem tax for fire service protection from approximately 30,000 residents.\nAccording to an annual audit conducted by the state auditor's office, in fiscal 2014 the county collected $284,017 in excess ad valorem tax. The residents affected live in the South Madison Fire District, from Lake Caroline to Deerfield, according to Madison County Administrator Mark Houston.\nState Auditor Stacey Pickering tells The Clarion-Ledger ( http://on.thec-l.com/1WdbMqc ) the excess funds were discovered during a routine county audit.\nPickering said the error was a misunderstanding on the county's part.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
