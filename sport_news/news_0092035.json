(AP) — Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy is out indefinitely after revealing he had a setback with his hamstring injury last week. \nMcCoy spoke about the setback for the first time on Friday. He said he was making progress in his recovery from the left hamstring injury before Buffalo’s Week 3 game against the Miami Dolphins, but hurt it again on Sept. 24. McCoy attempted to play through the injury in Buffalo’s 41-14 win over the Dolphins but ran for just 16 yards on 11 carries. \nMcCoy originally injured his hamstring at a training camp practice on Aug. 18. \nReceiver Sammy Watkins (calf), guard John Miller (groin), safety Aaron Williams (neck) and receiver Marquise Goodwin (ribs) have also been ruled out for Sunday’s game against the New York Giants.
