It would not take long for him to throw another, as Trumaine Johnson picked him off in the second quarter.\nRodgers also lost a fumble, but it did not seem to matter as the Green Bay Packers beat the Rams 24-10.\nThe first pick came in the first quarter with the Packers up 7-0. Barron was blitzing on the play and caught a piece of the ball which sailed into the air. Laurinaitis quickly turned and got his hands out to make the play.\nIt was his first interception at Lambeau Field since Dec. 2 of 2012. Including the playoffs, Rodgers had 49 touchdowns in-between the two interceptions. The second interception gave him his first two-interception game at home since 2010.\n Aaron Rodgers is human after all pic.twitter.com/Hc4uO1KZkz\n— The Cauldron (@TheCauldron) Oct. 11, 2015 Related Coverage N.F.L.

Harrison Smith was not fooled and got the interception.\n“That’s what it was?” Rodgers said “Shouldn’t have called that play.\nRodgers finished the day having completed 19 of 30 passes for 241 yards and 2 touchdowns. James Jones proved vital once again with a 65-yard touchdown catch.\nDespite the win, Rodgers was unhappy with the turnovers.\n“We’ve had so many games where we take care of the football,” Rodgers said. “his was uncharacteristic of us.
