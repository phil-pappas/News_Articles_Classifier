He's also the NBA's foremost troll, both lauded and loathed for the taciturn interviews he regularly gives reporters during the season. Popovich's latest antics come from the NBA's Monday media jamboree, in which every team met with reporters to build hype for the 2015-16 season that starts in about a month. NBATV’s Jared Greenberg was there in San Antonio, just doing his best — but Pop was having none of it until finally breaking character with a grin after taking Greenberg for quite a ride.
