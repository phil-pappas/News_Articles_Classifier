There’s things in our business that can cause years to be good and bad and that’s everything from missing games with weather to not having attendance where it needs to be, to ups and downs with sponsorships.” \nThe Prospect League announced earlier this week that a new team would be joining the league in Lafayette, Indiana. \nThe two moves, however, are not related, and the RiverRats are expected to relocate to a yet-to-be-determined city. \nThe RiverRats concluded the season 22-35, last in the East Division for the first time in team history and were 185-216 in their seven seasons. \nThey competed for spots in the playoffs but never qualified with just two winning seasons, 30-26 in 2010 and 33-26 in 2012. \nHowever, wins and losses are not necessarily how success is measured in collegiate summer league baseball, said Tyler Lairson, who managed the ’Rats in each of their seven seasons. \n“As far as winning or losing, it’s really not what collegiate levels are about,” Lairson said. “We feel successful that we had guys go on, one at the big leagues. I think we did a lot of good for a lot of college players and teams for the kids that played here for the seven years. \n“I’m pleased with the seven years that I had with the organization. As far as the team leaving, obviously that’s a tough thing to swallow, but inevitably, things grow bigger than what you can handle.” \nBeaman said she and co-owners John Cate and Duke Ward explored other options to keep baseball at McBride Stadium, including joining other leagues, but ultimately had to make the decision. \n“That second week in August, you kind of evaluate things,” Beaman said. “We knew attendance was not where it needed to be, it was just one of those years. It really takes all those components to be in a certain place to make it work. \n“… It’s a sad day that we have to come to this realization, but at the same time it’s been a great seven years, the ‘Rats have done a lot for the community, we appreciate all of that from that side of things.” \nA call to Prospect League commissioner Bryan Wickline seeking comment was not immediately returned. \nBut Beaman and Lairson both compare the move to when the Richmond Roosters, former members of the Frontier League baseball organization, left Richmond in 2005. \nThe RiverRats had an average attendance of 573 in 2015, their lowest by far since joining the league in 2009, and a total of 15,474 for the season. They also hosted the annual All-Star game this past summer. \n“It’s kind of one of those things, much like the Frontier League, you have leagues that start out very baseball-minded, work on a budget where you can have high-quality baseball at a fairly low budget,” Lairson said. “The league grew and it cost a lot of money to sustain an organization and where the league went to as far as owners and what it takes to run teams, it was very hard to sustain, obviously, to the point to where something had to be done.” \nThe RiverRats had many players go on to play baseball after spending time in Richmond. \nT.J. Weir, Todd Eaton, Nolan Earley Freddie Cabrera, Chuck Ghysels, Ethan Wilson, Mike Giovenco and Derek Eitel are former ‘Rats that went on to be drafted by major league organizations. \nRyan Skellie, Ray Delvalle, Justin Pearson and former Earlham College standouts Adam Painter and Matt Brankle all went on to spend time in the Frontier League. \nBeaman and Lairson, co-owners of the Hitters Hangout baseball and softball workout facility, turn their focus to that for the moment. \nMaybe someday, baseball can return to McBride Stadium. For now, it’s time for a change, and time to look back on the last seven years with success. \n“I just want to make sure that folks understand that we appreciate the seven years and the faithful fans and sponsors we’ve had and partnerships we’ve had,” Beaman said. \n“… We hope one day we might be able to bring whatever the next venture is with baseball, we’re always looking for opportunities.” 262 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1RzpxcP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:39:35.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
