This week's challenge versus the No. 1 team in Class 1A, Lena-Winslow, will break that tie and maybe provide some answers. \"We're still trying to figure out who we are; we're still working things out,\" said Diduch, who brings his Forreston (5-1) team into Lena-Winslow for a Week 7 matchup with the undefeated Panthers. \"This is our third big test, and it's definitely going to be one of those true measuring sticks, because we've got to find some things out.\" Forreston knocked off then-No. 1 Galena 32-29 in Week 2 and has dropped just one game, but it was a 34-0 blowout loss to No. 4 Dakota. Le-Win (6-0) edged Dakota 14-13 last week, and will now take aim at the No. 8-ranked Cardinals. While Forreston still has Eastland-Pearl City and Pecatonica (a combined 1-11) on its schedule, it's tonight's matchup with the top dogs in 1A that will let the defending Class 1A state champion Cardinals know where they stand if they expect to make another playoff run. \"This is about who is going to show what they've really got, inside,\" Diduch said. \"Who's going into the playoffs moving in the right direction, and who's still searching. It's big.\" Forreston allowed 320 yards rushing to Dakota. The Cardinals' run defense will get another test with the Panthers' potent ground attack. Le-Win quarterback Tanner Lawfer has thrown the ball just 10 times (completing only two for 33 yards), but the Panthers have run all over teams all season. The Panthers have outscored their first six foes 226-61. Forreston has put up 197 points on offense, but 104 of those came against South Beloit (50-0 on Sept. 18) and East Dubuque (54-6 last week). \"There's no doubt, this is going to be another one of those real, big challenges,\" Diduch said. \"It's not do or die, which we know doesn't come until the end, but we expect to compete, and battle. This is a chance to prove we can play against some of the best.\" The Cardinals, like the Panthers, do most of their damage on the ground. Forreston QB Caleb Poffenberger is just 3-for-5 for 20 yards on the season, but Matt Akins has 681 yards on the ground, and Logan Rogers (573 yards) and AJ Christensen (384 yards) have helped keep the Cardinals' wing-T offense rolling as well. It stalled against Dakota, but they weren't at their best. \"Nothing against Dakota,\" Diduch added, \"but we know we have more to show than that. \"Hopefully, this is a week it will come out.\" Jay Taft: 815-987-1384; jtaft@rrstar.com ; @JayTaft", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:29:37.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
