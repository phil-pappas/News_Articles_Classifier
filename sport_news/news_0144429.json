Boston and Hill were beaten by the Yankees, 4-1, on Thursday night, snapping the team's season-high six-game winning streak and the left-hander's run of incredible, victorious performances. New York's victory clinched it a playoff berth and meant that Boston could not finish with a winning record in 2015. The story of the game was that Hill was merely good or solid or fine instead of something more amazing. The left-hander, who had been a revelation in his first three starts this season, regressed to a level less transcendent and more realistic moving forward. That doesn’t mean it's not encouraging. That this could reasonably be considered Hill's worst outing in four tries is astonishing. He only lasted six innings this time, he walked three men and he allowed two runs. He had the audacity to strike out fewer than 10 batters. The fly in his ointment Thursday was a second inning that saw Carlos Beltran's home run to right field — no, Mookie Betts couldn’t save him this time, in part because he was stationed in center — and Brendan Ryan's two-out RBI single. Hill walked two in the inning, matching the total from his first three starts. \"The wind played a pretty good role on a few things,\" Hill said, alluding to the Beltran home run. \"I thought that was a fly ball to right, and it ended up going out. That was really the only pitch [I'd want back].\" From that point forward, though, he looked pretty much like the same pitcher who had cruised against every other American League East foe. He got two double-play grounders to erase baserunners, he stranded a leadoff double in the fourth and he struck out the middle of the New York order in his final inning of the year. Hill pitched 29 innings for the Red Sox and posted a zero in 26 of them. He allowed 14 hits and five walks. He struck out 36. He allowed only five earned runs, good for an ERA of 1.55. Batters were nearly twice as likely to strike out against him than to reach base. \"I threw the ball the way I knew I could throw it. That’s all I can say, really,\" Hill said. \"I think if you look at the overall body of work, there was a lot to build off of from there. I'm looking forward to next year.\" \"He just continued where he left off last start,\" interim manager Torey Lovullo said. Hill has said all along that he would stay in the present and not think too much about his future. But his four starts with Boston late in the season have made him one of the more fascinating free agents in recent memory. The sample is small, obviously, but the extent of Hill's success — coming against teams in contention — is sure to raise eyebrows. Is it enough to earn him a legitimate shot at a major-league rotation next spring? Is it enough to earn him a major-league contract? Is it enough to earn him either of those things with his hometown Red Sox? Page 2 of 2 - \"I know that we’ve had a lot of very positive discussions internally about Rich Hill,\" said Lovullo. \"He’s done everything and then some to put himself in a very good position.\" Does Hill think he showed he could be a major-league starter? \"100 percent,\" he said without hesitation. \"If anybody goes out there and looks at those four games, four quality starts, that speaks for itself.\" CC Sabathia was effective for five innings, allowing one run and escaping a bases-loaded jam in the fifth by getting Travis Shaw to fly out to center. Adam Warren tossed three scoreless innings out of the bullpen, surviving a scare when a Betts drive to left was knocked down by the wind at the warning track. \"We just couldn’t get the big hit,\" said Lovullo, adding that he \"couldn’t be more proud\" of how his team played in the four-game series. \"We came in here as a very young team, won the first three games against a playoff team. We pressed it all the way to the limit.\" A pair of late solo home runs — one by Greg Bird off Jean Machi, a second by Rob Refsnyder off Heath Hembree — provided the final margin.
