The Comets broke open a close game at halftime with a 21-point third quarter en route to a 49-14 Midwestern League win at Dutch Meyer Field. \"The kids realize we have an opportunity to have a special season and we made the most of the opportunity tonight,\" said Crater coach John Beck. Austin Kramer was one of several Comets to come up big in the MWL opener. The junior wide receiver scored three touchdowns — one on an interception return and two on passes from quarterback Matt Struck. \"Austin had a complete game both ways, offensively and defensively,\" said Beck. \"We spread the ball around and he was the guy who was open. He made a lot of really good plays.\" And as he's done all season, Struck delivered another primetime performance. The 6-foot-2, 218-pound senior passed for 219 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 61 yards and two more touchdowns against the Eugene school. Struck scored the final TD for the Comets (5-0) on an impressive 51-yard, fourth-quarter run on a read option play. \"I think Matt is the best quarterback in the state at any level,\" said Beck. \"He's been playing this way the whole season. He's been very consistent for us. He's a big, strong athlete and makes good decisions.\" While the Comets’ passing game was functioning effectively, Cavin Gillispie was also having success on the ground. Gillispie paced the rushing attack with 150 yards and two touchdowns. \"He's a hard guy to tackle one-on-one,\" Beck said of the senior running back. \"He got a lot of yards after contact.\" Defensively, Crater limited Marist (2-3) to 221 yards in offense by changing fronts and giving the Spartans different looks. \"Overall it was our best game of the year,\" said Beck. \"We executed real well on offense and defensively we did the same thing. We ran to the ball and executed our schemes.\" The Comets host fourth-ranked Ashland in a battle of unbeatens in a key MWL game next Friday.
