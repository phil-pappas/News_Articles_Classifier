Jared Sullinger may have moved two steps up, and perhaps taken one step back at the same time, during Thursday night’s 99-85 victory against the New York Knicks at TD Garden. Afforded extra floor time with Stevens sitting Kelly Olynyk (rest), Sullinger had some impressive stats to go with some head-shaking plays. He finished with 16 points, eight rebounds, six assists and two blocks. But he also racked up three fouls in 19 minutes, committed a three-second violation and missed 6-of-10 free throws. Whether Sullinger has done enough to earn himself another look in the main frontcourt rotation — especially opening night when Olynyk is suspended for the shoulder tug of Kevin Love in last year’s playoffs — will likely be determined after he gets another long run in Friday’s exhibition finale in Manchester, N.H., against the Philadelphia 76ers. Tyler Zeller scored 15 points in 19 minutes. Marcus Smart had seven points and nine assists in 26 minutes. David Lee returned from a bout with strep throat for seven points and eight rebounds in 23 minutes. Jae Crowder had a strong night on both ends of the floor with 13 points — including 3-of-4 on 3-pointers — and seven rebounds in 25 minutes, while being largely responsible for holding New York’s Carmelo Anthony to eight points on 4-of-18 shooting. Isaiah Thomas sat out his second straight preseason game with a sore leg. Avery Bradley also left the game in the third quarter with a bruised shin.
