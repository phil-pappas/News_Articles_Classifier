If rugby can position itself and we can do well as an Olympic sport, then all of a sudden it will hit the eyes of so many more Americans,\" said Friday, a former England Sevens captain and coach.\nGRASSROOTS SURGE\nThere was a time when rugby was a booming sport in America. Adopted by universities in the mid-1800s, it was played by three U.S. presidents, John F. Kennedy among them, and was once the dominant football code before American football took hold.\nIn fact, the United States are the reigning Olympic champions, having won the rugby gold medal at the 1920 and 1924 games, the last time the sport featured at the summer games.\nAlmost a century later, World Rugby, the sport's governing body, recognized the rebirth of rugby in the United States and named San Francisco as host for the 2019 Sevens World Cup.\nThe move was a timely boost for USA Rugby, which has built its strategy around a nationwide youth program that officials say has introduced two million new players to the game since 2008, many at a much younger age than had been previously tried.\n\"They're the seeds you plant in the ground for the harvest in the future,\" Melville said. \"We're just starting to see those kids come through as the first generation who have been playing rugby for seven or eight years.\"\nBruce Thomas, 28, club director of the San Francisco Golden Gate Rugby Club, said several clubs in the area have more than 300 youth members and the sport is thriving in colleges in northern California.\n\"Rugby is certainly growing, there's no denying that it's becoming a more recognized, established sport,\" he said.\nUSA Men's Sevens captain Madison Hughes, 23, said he saw rugby growing despite a crowded U.S. sports landscape that includes American football, soccer and basketball.\n\"Rugby's not trying to take over from some of those sports, but just trying to reach out to more people,\" Hughes said. \"Especially in the United States, I think Sevens is the short-term vehicle for rugby to grow its popularity.\"\nLONG-TERM FUTURE\nBut without a professional league, many USA Eagles stars are forced to ply their trade abroad - 19 of the men's 15s squad play for clubs in Europe.\nFew players can make a living from the game in the United States. The small number of players on USA Sevens contracts earn around £25,000-£45,000 ($38,600-$70,000)- a year, said Friday.\nThat compares with the £100,000 a year that an established player in the English Premiership might earn and is a tiny fraction of the £13 million that English Premiership soccer star Wayne Rooney reportedly earns a year.\nIn the United States, a professional league could also absorb athletes who fail to make it other sports. Sevens star Carlin Isles, for example, took up rugby after abandoning his goal of making it to the Olympics as a sprinter.\n\"I think they need some sort of professional league that will capture the imagination of the American sporting public again and will allow them to grow tribal affiliations in terms of supporters,\" USA Sevens head coach Friday said.\nBut developing the players in the specialist positions needed in the 15-person game in order to compete with the best in the world like the New Zealand All Blacks would be a 20-25 year project, he said.\nAs rugby seeks the successful transition to the professional era achieved by lacrosse and soccer in recent decades, the debate is whether to build franchises around the Sevens or 15s format.\n\"The growth of the game, the commercial viability, the competitiveness comes from the 15s. That's the traditional form of rugby,\" said Golden Gate's Thomas.\n\"I do think you need both and I think if you were to grow one or the other, I would say grow the 15s first.\"\n(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Julian Linden in Singapore; Steve Ginsberg in Washington DC; Stuart McDill and Jon Boyle in London; Writing by Jon Boyle; Editing by Angus MacSwan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:53:08.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
