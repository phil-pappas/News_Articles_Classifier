He has carried 36 times for 348 yards and seven touchdowns, in addition to throwing for 354 yards and four touchdowns. PEQUANNOCK – The scoreboard served as an alarm clock for the Pequannock football team last month.\nIt read Boonton 46, Pequannock 27. And it reminded the Golden Panthers that they would need to execute and prepare better if they’re to be as successful as they were last season.\n“It was definitely a wake-up call,” said Tommy Crooks, Pequannock’s senior quarterback/cornerback. “We needed that.”\nThe Golden Panthers responded about as encouragingly to that three-touchdown road defeat as Pequannock coach Ed Kopp and his staff could’ve hoped.\nThey’ve won three straight games — against Wallkill Valley, Whippany Park and Hopatcong — by an average margin of 25.3 points. Their winning streak has moved them into fourth place in the North 1, Group 2 power-point standings, an indication just past the midway mark of the season that Pequannock is capable of making a postseason run in its stacked section.\n“We’ve just got to keep progressing,” said senior defensive tackle Jake Foukas. “I think we’ve got a better team than last year.”\nThat’s saying something, considering Pequannock went 9-2 last season and reached the North 1, Group 2 semifinals.\nThese Golden Panthers, who’ll play at home tonight against Kinnelon (0-5), won’t get a chance to validate Foukas’ assessment until the playoffs begin next month. Their 4-1 start is impressive, though, because they brought back just one starter on offense from last year’s team. And they have had to battle through injuries to two of the team’s top players – three-year starters Justin Brunda and Matt Forrest.\nBrunda, a senior tailback/cornerback, missed the Boonton game and didn’t play on offense in Pequannock’s first two games because of a back injury. Forrest, a senior tailback/inside linebacker, suffered a shoulder injury in the second quarter against Boonton and hadn’t played until taking about a dozen snaps in Pequannock’s 35-13 win at Hopatcong a week ago.\nBut sophomore tailback Sean Klimek has produced consistently while Brunda and Forrest have worked their way back. He leads Pequannock with 561 rushing yards and six touchdowns on 62 carries.\nCrooks also has played well in his first season as a starting varsity quarterback. He has carried 36 times for 348 yards and seven touchdowns, in addition to throwing for 354 yards and four touchdowns.\n“Tommy has made all the right plays,” Kopp said. “He has made great decisions, kept the turnovers down and done a great job for us.”\nCrooks has intercepted three passes as well for a defense driven by Foukas, who has recorded 29 tackles, including six for losses, defended three passes and recovered two fumbles. Junior inside linebacker Zach Toback (33 tackles), senior defensive tackle Johanser Joseph (31 tackles) and senior outside linebacker Jake Kershaw (30 tackles) also have been impact players for a Pequannock defense that has permitted just 11.0 points per game during its winning streak.\nWhile pleased, Kopp knows there is plenty of room for improvement he hopes to see tonight against the struggling Colts, who would love to upset their rival on the road.\n“Last year we were a grind-it-out type of team, a workmanlike group,” Kopp said. “Four games came down to the wire. This year we have the athletic ability to improve on [last season].\n“The question is, mentally, can we handle the big situations? Can we come back from a touchdown behind in the fourth quarter? We haven’t been in that situation yet. We haven’t proven that yet.”\nEmail: idec@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:08:34.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
