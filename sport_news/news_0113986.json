(AP) - Lafayette Parish School Board may decide to keep private general counsel as it continues to look for ways to cut legal costs\nAfter much talk about curbing its legal expenses, The Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1GQBch1 ) the board appears now to be favoring keeping its general counsel.\nHammonds, Sills, Adkins & Guice, with law offices in Baton Rouge and Monroe, has served as the board's interim general counsel since early 2014. Previously, the firm served as the board's special counsel, though it picked up many day-to-day legal issues on behalf of central office staff.\nA resolution proposed by board member Jeremy Hidalgo would name the firm the board's general counsel, removing the term interim.\nThe board will consider the general counsel resolution at its Nov. 2 meeting.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
