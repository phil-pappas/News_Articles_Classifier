(POSTMEDIA NETWORK FILES) Article Report an error \nNEW YORK – Drew Stafford couldn't help but wonder if the moment was scripted. \nNear the end of his scrum on Sunday morning after a skate at the New Jersey Devils practice facility, the Winnipeg Jets winger was asked to provide a quick word on his new centre, Adam Lowry. \n“Are you asking me this because he's right next to me, so I can pump his tires?” quipped Stafford. \nUnbeknownst to your humble agent, Lowry was minding his own business and untying his skates in the locker next to Stafford, having slid in once the interview had already started. \nThe truth is that Stafford would have been happy to pump the tires of Lowry whether he was sitting there or not. \n“When I got traded here, I had heard a lot of good things about him (being) a young and up-and-coming player,” said Stafford. “The organization is grooming him to be that physical, two-way centre. A top-six centre that they can rely on, not only in a shutdown role but where he can contribute on the score sheet and be a two-way force. So far, so good. \n“I've been really impressed with him.” \nThe Jets (2-0) are back in action on Monday in a matinee game against the New York Islanders (0-2) as a four-game road swing continues. \nIt's easy to be impressed by what Lowry has done in such a short time. \nOn the flip side, it's hard to believe that just over a year ago, Lowry basically had to scratch and claw to steal a spot on the Jets roster, eventually shifting from left wing to centre to give his team some much-needed size down the middle. \n“I was really impressed with him just last year,” said Jets centre Bryan Little. “He's one of those players that it didn't look like his first year in the league. It didn't seem like he was a rookie. He looked comfortable and obviously, he's a big strong guy who is hard to knock off the puck. He fit right in and they're going to expect even more of him now. The entire team is going to lean on him to take it up another notch.” \nTo start the campaign, Lowry is playing with Stafford and Russian forward Alex Burmistrov on a line that will be asked to check effectively and produce some offence. \nThat unit already has combined for two goals and five points through two games. \n“This year, you're more more confident in what your role is going to be and more confident in your ability,” said Lowry, who had 11 goals and 23 points in 80 games last season while finishing 12th in the NHL in hits with 256, an average of 3.2 per game. “You start to get to know teams and players throughout the leagues. Going into games, I feel a little more prepared. You want to develop as a player and there are some things in my game that I want to get better at. \n“Our line is looking to be a solid line that can contribute at both ends of the rink. We offer a good blend of a lot of things. It's nice to know you have the trust of the coach and you want to continue to show him that you can do it and you can excel at that job.” \nBeing able to excel in that job can be a tall task in the Western Conference when you're going up against the likes of Jonathan Toews, Ryan Getzlaf and Anze Kopitar, just to name a few. \n“You look at a lot of the teams that have been successful, they have a pretty big one-two punch at the centre position and if you're going to be able to go through those teams, you're going to need to kind of shut those guys down and almost neutralize them,” said Lowry. “Our team has got tremendous depth and we're looking forward to those challenges.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:28:14.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
