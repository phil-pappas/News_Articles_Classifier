A series of tweets exposed possible divisions within the team that's started 1-4 going into the AT&T Red River Showdown with Oklahoma.\nOn one side are the upperclassmen who are trying to provide leadership and salvage the season after having little success in Austin. On the other side is a group of talented freshmen who have brought plenty of attitude.\n\"There may a little disconnect with the way they're feeling,\" senior cornerback Duke Thomas said about the freshmen. \"They feel like they need to play, they're hungry, they're the future. That's what everybody is telling them.\"\nThe exchanges came after coach Charlie Strong called two team meetings, one Saturday after TCU and the other Sunday, to promote team unity.\nIt began with junior safety Dylan Haines calling out teammates, including the team's freshmen for a lack of preparation and unwillingness to put in extra time.\n\"People need to grow up and take things more seriously,\" Haines said. \"A lot of people aren't preparing the way we should be preparing.\"\nSpecifically, Haines pointed to practices and extra sessions scheduled by the seniors to improve the team.\nThe freshmen \"just want to go out there and play the game on Saturday,\" Haines said. \"They don't want to put in the work on Sunday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday. You can go through motions in practice or you can go out and practice.\"\nNot long afterward, the freshmen started responding via Twitter. They didn't exactly embrace Haines' characterization.\n\"Lol,\" tweeted freshman Charles Omenihu above a Haines Quote: .\nIn case anyone was unsure of the meaning, the former Rowlett standout clarified his position in another tweet.\n\"People get in front of cameras and just talk they [sic] heads off always remember think before you speak.\"\nAdded freshman safety DeShon Elliott of Rockwall-Heath in a tweet apparently referencing Haines: \"People talk just to talk.\"\nFreshman receiver DeAndre McNeal of Mesquite Poteet posted a longer message, saying the freshmen don't accept mediocrity and are trying to turn Texas around.\n\"We're supposed to be a team, but instead we're bashing on each other,\" McNeal wrote. \"If you don't want to be here at Texas then kick rocks. We haven't won ANYTHING to have people calling out others.\"\nBoyd, a freshman defensive back, retweeted a suggestion at halftime against TCU that he and linebacker Malik Jefferson consider transferring to Texas A&M. He apologized Sunday.\nThomas said he addressed the issue with Boyd, saying the entire team felt \"disrespected\" by the tweet.\n\"I told him you can't do that here,\" Thomas said. \"It's not the same as it was at Gilmer.\"\nThomas said he thought the problem had been addressed at the team meetings and said the message must be sent to get the young players off social media.\nMaybe old-fashioned communication might be the best. But that's not the way that 19-year-olds do things.\n\"Everyone is not on the same page,\" Haines said, \"and that's why we're playing the way playing, and that's why the season isn't going the way we want it go.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-06T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:46:51.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
