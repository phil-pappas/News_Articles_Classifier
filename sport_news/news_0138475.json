He was placed in an ambulance after the game and sent to the McMinnville Municipal Airport where he was flown to Nashville, Wyant said. \nSiegel assistant Jason Pitts said he never saw Bramble suffer a blow to the head against the Pioneers. He said he has reviewed the film multiple times but didn't see any questionable contact. \nSiegel High sponsored a prayer vigil Saturday afternoon. No members of the media attended the vigil out of respect for the family's request. \nThe Siegel community has been rocked with heartache this season. \nSiegel football player Mason Loupe died in early September after a gunshot to the head. That same week, Siegel Middle football player Caleb Victory sustained a serious head injury that ended up in him going to Atlanta for rehabilitation. \n\"We will definitely have our counselor team at the school Monday to support students, teachers and administrators,\" wrote Rutherford County Schools spokesman James Evans in an email to The Daily News Journal. \nWyant said his focus right now remains with Bramble and his family. \n“It’s about Baylor and his family right now,” said Wyant, who stay with the family during the surgery. “I’m not worried about the Siegel community. I’m worried about him and the family. We need to support and pray for them.” \nReach Tom Kreager at 615-278-5168 and on Twitter @Kreager. 4098 CONNECT 166 TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.dnj.com/1S2J31E TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:18:36.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
