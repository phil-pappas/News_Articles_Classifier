Conway also scored its third touchdown on as many possessions in the second half. \nBut Van Buren (2-3, 0-2) didn’t go down without a fight. The Pointers quickly marched down the field in four plays, scoring on a 6-yard TD pass from quarterback Jordan Barlow to Jaylynn Dye. Brad Rodriguez’s PAT made it 42-28, Conway, with 4:38 left. \nThe Pointers then recovered a successful onside kick and scored again 26 seconds later. Two plays after Dye caught a 37-yard halfback pass from Caleb Salisbury down to the Conway 11, Barlow found Zach Wornkey in the end zone, covering those final 11 yards. Rodriguez added the PAT, making it a seven-point game with 4:12 remaining. \nHowever, it turned out to be the last time Van Buren would get to touch the football. Conway took possession at its own 20 following the kickoff and proceeded to convert three first downs to eventually run out the clock. \nConway scored touchdowns on each of its first two possessions to take a 14-0 lead. Following Conway’s second TD, the Pointers finally got on the board on the ensuing series. \nAfter Van Buren reached past midfield, Dye took a sweep around the right side and went in 44 yards for a touchdown. Dye — off a direct snap — then ran it in for two points, cutting Conway’s lead to 14-8 late in the first quarter. \nThe Pointers got the ball back after forcing Conway to punt and needed just three plays to score. Once again, it was courtesy of Dye, who took another sweep around the right side and took off. Dye cut upfield near the Conway 15, and after getting a final block from teammate Michael Pickens, reached the end zone to complete a 66-yard TD. Rodriguez’s kick made it 15-14, Pointers. \nVan Buren had another scoring chance on its next series, but a field goal try was blocked. Conway got the ball and quickly moved downfield in eight plays to score a TD, putting the Wampus Cats up by six, 21-15, with 1:42 left in the half. \nDye proceeded to break off several solid-yardage runs, resulting in three Pointer first downs, the latter coming with six seconds left before intermission. With the ball at the Conway 33, Van Buren took its last time out. \nBarlow launched a pass toward the end zone. Salisbury, playing receiver, got a step ahead of his defender, and was able to haul in the catch for a Hail Mary touchdown as time ran out in the opening half. There was a bad snap on the PAT, resulting in a running try, which was stopped by Conway as the score remained tied at intermission, 21-21. \nDye finished the game with 200 rushing yards on 15 carries and two TDs, although he had 187 of those yards in the opening half. He also caught four passes for 79 yards and a TD. Wornkey hauled in five passes for 80 yards. <p>[strong]High School Football[/strong]</p><p>[strong]Conway 42, Van Buren 35[/strong]</p><p>Conway 14 7 14 7  42</p><p>Van Buren 8 13 0 14  35</p><p>[strong]First Quarter[/strong]</p><p>Con  Allen 21 pass from Smith (Underwood kick), 8:47</p><p>Con  Odom 19 run (Underwood kick), 3:26</p><p>Van  Dye 44 run (Dye run), :14</p><p>[strong]Second Quarter[/strong]</p><p>Van  Dye 66 run (Rodriguez kick), 9:16</p><p>Con  Dail 11 run (Underwood kick), 1:42</p><p>Van  Salisbury 33 pass from Barlow (run failed), :00</p><p>[strong]Third Quarter[/strong]</p><p>Con  Dail 3 run (Underwood kick), 7:36</p><p>Con  Smith 19 run (Underwood kick), :45</p><p>[strong]Fourth Quarter[/strong]</p><p>Con  Dail 1 run (Underwood kick), 5:59</p><p>Van  Dye 6 pass from Barlow (Rodriguez kick), 4:38</p><p>Van  Wornkey 11 pass from Barlow (Rodriguez kick), 4:12</p>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:13:35.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
