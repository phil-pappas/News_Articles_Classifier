I didn’t understand why Jamie didn’t follow us in,” he said. \n“But look, we’ll analyse that this week and make sure that it doesn’t become a problem in the future and move on. \n“We’ve got Gold Coast in two weeks time, so we’ve got to move forward now and keep pressing on.” \nWith just four rounds to go, Whincup now sits over 800 points behind championship leader Mark Winterbottom (2491).
