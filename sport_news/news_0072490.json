(AP Photo/Gary McCullough) ORG XMIT: GVP119 (Gary McCullough / Associated Press) \nGAINESVILLE — Quarterback Will Grier was sick - literally and figuratively. \nFlorida Gator fans were delirious. \nA much-anticipated showdown with No. 3 Ole Miss turned instead into a showcase game on national TV for first-year coach Jim McElwain’s fast-rising program. \nBehind four first-half touchdowns by Grier and a unrelenting defensive effort, the No. 25 Gators (5-0, 3-0 SEC) shocked the high-scoring Rebels 38-10 on Saturday night before a raucous announced crowd of 90,585 in the Swamp. \n“That was a good football team,” McElwain said of Ole Miss. “Our guys took it to ’em.” \nOne week removed from leading Florida’s come-back win over Tennessee, Grier led the way with a career-best game a little more than 24 hours after his playing status was in question. \nPICTURE GALLERY: Check out pictures from the NCAA football game between the Florida Gators and the Ole Miss Rebels at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium at Florida Field in Gainesville, Florida. \nGrier was a game-time decision due to an illness he battled in recent days. But he showed no lingering effects and steered the Gators to an early lead. Florida’s defense took over from there, teeing off on Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly and stymieing the SEC’s leading offense. \nGrier’s first touchdown throw was his best, and set the tone for the Gators’ best offensive performance of the season. \nWith Ole Miss 6-foot-4, 295-pound defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche in his face, Grier still found Demarcus Robinson in stride for a 36-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead six minutes into the game. \nGrier finished 24-of-29 passing for 271 yards, four touchdowns and a quarterback rating of 206.8. \n“He did a good job,” McElwain said. “He played the position. Let’s give credit to the guys around him, now.” \nAlong the way, the redshirt freshman showed he could make all the throws against the Rebels (4-1, 2-1). \nHe found tight end Jake McGee for a 2-yard score off of textbook play action. Grier later threaded the needle on third down to slot receiver Brandon Powell, who caught it in stride and headed up the sideline for a 77-yard touchdown and a 19-0 lead. \nGrier’s final touchdown was a 10-yard hookup with first-year freshman Antonio Callaway, whose 63-yard touchdown catch from Grier was the game-winner the previous week against Tennessee. \nThe touchdown pushed the Gators lead to 25-0 at halftime. \n“Will looked great tonight,” McGee said. “Just keep it going, keep learning from mistakes, just learning from the repetition he’s getting on the field. The sky’s the limit.” \nMeanwhile, Ole Miss’ vaunted offense fell apart in the face of the Gators’ defense. \nThe Rebels entered the game averaging 54.8 points and scored 43 points during a win at Alabama two weeks earlier. But Ole Miss did not score a touchdown until 4:04 remained against Florida. \nKelly entered the game the SEC’ s leading passer but finished 26 of 40 for 259 yards, a touchdown, an interception and a fumble. \n“It began with the defense,” McElwain said. “Our defense played their tails off. \n“That was a great performance.” \nOle Miss never found its footing, while Grier and the Gators offense pulled away. The Rebels had six negative plays – three sacks – and just seven first downs during their first five possessions. \nLinebacker Antonio Morrison led the way with 13 tackles, including 3.5 for loss. The Gators finished with four sacks and 11 tackles for a loss. \nEven when the Rebels seemed to have things rolling, the Gators found a way to stop them. \nTrailing 25-0, Ole Miss opened the second half with an impressive drive to reach to UF 1-yard line. But facing first-and-goal, the Rebels had three negative plays and a no gain on the final five plays of a 19-play drive, settling for a 22-yard field goal by Gary Wunderlich. \n“Boy, was that a big stop, big stop,” McElwain said. “What a great stand. Made ’em earn it. \n“It was loud in there during that thing.“ \nFans finally have something to cheer. \nMcElwain is first Florida coach to start 5-0 since Steve Spurrier in 1990. Under his watch, the Gators, sure to move inside the top 20 on Sunday, are becoming relevant again. \n“We all, every single one of us, is behind Coach Mac and what he’s doing,” Grier said. “He’s doing a great job and we love him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T18:57:31.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
