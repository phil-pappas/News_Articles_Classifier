Here are some of the highlights:\nQuestion: If you're (Jon) Daniels, what's the one move you make this offseason for Rangers?\nKevin Sherrington: Not sure I could limit it to one move. I think he ought to re-sign Napoli for the RH bat. That means he plays first base, or at least platoons with Prince. And that leaves Moreland out of the mix. I'd put together a package of Moreland, Leonys Martin, Chi Chi Gonzalez and a couple of prospects and see what kind of starter I could get for that. Start with Oakland's Sonny Gray and work my way down from there. I'd also bring back Colby Lewis.\nQuestion: Don't you think the Rangers will tender Leonys an offer merely because he's a tradable asset for someone?\nKevin Sherrington: Here's the problem: Delino DeShields is the much superior offensive option; Martin the much superior defensive option, essentially because of the difference in their arms.

But Jeff Banister made the right move going with offense over defense.\nClick here to read the full chat transcript.\nOn Twitter:\n @KSherringtonDMN", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/chats/2015/10/14/kevin-sherrington-answers-questions-cowboys-rangers-mavs-11-wednesday-oct-21-ask-now", "https://twitter.com/KSherringtonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-22T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:02:54.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
