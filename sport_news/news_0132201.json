Oh you didn’t hear? Last August, Harden signed a 13-year, $200 million deal with Adidas . In September, Harden was photographed wearing a pair of Nike’s. In response, Adidas sent Harden a truckload of sneakers. That’s not a cliché. They literally dispatched a truck filled with sneakers to his house.\n“You should see it,” Harden said. “They are everywhere.”\nYeah, it’s good to be James Harden. You were runner-up for MVP and took home the players version of the award last summer. You are coming off your best statistical season (27.4 points/7.0 assists/5.7 rebounds) and are credited for taking defense seriously for the first time. You strapped a battered Rockets team on your back, pulled them out of a 3–1 deficit against the Clippers in the conference semifinals and led Houston to its first conference finals since Hakeem Olajuwon wore a Rockets uniform.\nThings are good ... right?\n“Oh yeah, we’re moving in a good direction,” Harden said. Ever since I’ve been here, we’ve improved, we’ve gotten better. That’s what you want do, you want to improve every single year. Last year we added, like, five or six key pieces. We got to the West finals. Now we have a year under our belt, to where we can actually go through an entire training camp together and kind of know the ins and outs of each individual. So we’re more comfortable, I think. You look at the teams that win, they’re more comfortable, you know that they’ve been together. It’s rare that you see a team that they come together for one year and win a championship. Our last year was a good steppingstone for us, and then now, this year, we’re all in.”\n• Inside Harden’s starry summer: New shoe deal, NBA 2K16 and more\nHow do the Rockets get better? Ty Lawson helps. The ex- Nuggets point guard comes with some baggage—a July DUI arrest, which prompted Denver to immediately look to move him —but there is no questioning his talent. With Lawson and Patrick Beverley on board, Houston has a skilled offense/defense point guard combination.\n“Ty is going to help a lot, just because I can put up the ball a lot more and let him handle a lot more catch-and-shoot opportunities,” Harden said. “It will help my defense, as well, being able to play both ends of the floor at an extremely high level.”\nHow can Harden get better? He has an answer for that too. If there was one criticism of Harden last season it was that he would frequently exhibit bad body language. If a teammate took an errant shot, Harden would scowl or slump his shoulders. If he committed a turnover, he did little to hide his frustration.\n“I get frustrated, and when I do I know my teammates are looking at me like, ‘He’s frustrated we’re messing up, right now,’” Harden said. “So times like that, I have to just stay level and make sure that no matter what’s going on with me, I’m feeding out positive energy to my teammates, so they’re going to be locked in no matter what. And I think that’s going to carry us a long way, even in postseason.”\nPhoto: John W. McDonough for Sports Illustrated Physically, Harden will admit last season was a grind. He played in 81 games and led the league in total minutes (2,981). With Dwight Howard limited to 41 games and Beverley sidelined for the playoffs , the strain on Harden was considerable. Harden has always been a healthy eater—nutrition habits instilled with him in Oklahoma City stay with him today—but he needed to give his body a break. Which is why Harden decided to get away from the game this off-season. For a month, he didn’t pick up a basketball, the first time he has ever taken that kind of extended break. He traveled. He rested. He got regular massages. He blocked out the game.\n“I just tried to stay away, tried to clear my mind and kind of just reset and focus on just my body,” Harden said. “I tried to eat right, tried to get in good condition and focus on other things. Because basketball, once I’m playing and I’m in training camp and the season, I’ll catch a rhythm. That’s the easy part. But I needed to focus and figure other things out, my body being the most important.”\nAs Harden begins this season, he is facing an even bigger challenge than the last one. Golden State is still the defending champs. San Antonio got better. Oklahoma City will welcome Kevin Durant back to a deeper team than the one he left before his foot injury. The Clippers are still there. Every night in the Western Conference figures to bring a tough test. Harden gets it. But he knows that his team is as talented as it was last season. He says his relationship with Howard on the court is as strong as it has ever been. And he believes the lessons learned from last season will help him be a better player in this one.\n“It’s a long season and I have got to try not to get too overwhelmed,” Harden said. “Just stay level throughout the entire season. There’s going to be some times where I struggle, there’s going to be some times where I’m playing really, really well. So, no matter where I am, just stay level. Stay level and continue to work, and continue to just focus on the one goal.”\n• MAHONEY: Rockets with one of NBA’s best benches | West storylines\nA championship is the goal, obviously. Harden has come close before. In 2012, Harden was the sixth man on Oklahoma City’s Finals team. He remembers that loss. That loss hurt. Losing with Houston, Harden says, hurt more.\n“Obviously, in the Finals, you’re so close,” Harden said. “That was a learning experience. I didn’t really have all the pressure on me to go out there and carry the team, or whatever, every single night. “Last year, in Game 5 [against Golden State, when we lost, when I had 12 turnovers , that hurt me more than anything, because I pride myself on creating opportunities for my teammates, giving them easy shots, making sure everybody’s good. And when I was turning the basketball over, I wasn’t doing that, so I was taking away from them. Even though I worked so hard throughout the entire season, for it to end like that, it really messed me up throughout the summer.”\n“I’m going to motivate my teammates everyday and we’re going build to get back to that position. So if we’re in that situation again, that we will change and I won’t turn the basketball over. I’ll make sure we get good shots. I’ll make sure that we’re locked into focus. It will be different next time.”", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ChrisMannixSI"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:13:44.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
