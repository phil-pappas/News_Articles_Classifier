LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis Rams guard Rodger Saffold will require season-ending surgery for a right shoulder injury.\nSaffold was the most experienced player on the offensive line, which has two rookie starters. He was a second-round pick in 2010 and underwent surgery on his left shoulder last year.\nCoach Jeff Fisher said Saffold received a second opinion on his latest injury and doctors agreed surgery was necessary.\nThe Rams (2-3) have a bye this week. Tight end Lance Kendricks underwent surgery this week for a torn ligament in his finger and Fisher said he is questionable for next weekend's game against Cleveland.\nTight end Justice Cunningham, who had been on the practice squad, was elevated to the active roster.\n\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
