And again. And again.\n“It really hurt,” Monroe told Fox 12. “This is just my property… We have ten winemakers who work out of our space. This is their stuff too.”\nA little over a week elapsed between the three latest burglaries, with the most recent happening early Saturday morning.\nThis time, new oak barrels mostly from France were the target, at a cost of $6,000-$7,000.\nEach time, the crooks were caught on camera breaking into the fenced back lot, backing up a white van and rolling as many barrels out as they could.\nMonroe and his associates went to police, but weren’t given much hope the stolen items would be recovered.\nFacing thousands of dollars in losses, frustrated and at a breaking point, they decided to do their own detective work and found a Craigslist post that led them to a re-sale store in Gresham.\n“We showed up, and within two minutes I see one of our new barrels just sitting there on its head,” he added, explaining that each barrel has a unique logo or marking number that identifies it like a fingerprint.\nMonroe said they again called police, but officers could only put a “police hold” on the items, ordering the store not to sell them until rightful ownership could be sorted out by detectives and the District Attorney’s office. The process could take days or even weeks.\nSo Monroe decided to make a deal: bring all the stolen stuff back, and he wouldn’t charge the store trying to sell it.\nAnd it worked.\nHe got a call from the re-sale store half an hour later, saying 11 oak barrels, 2 stainless steel barrels and a stainless steel tank were there waiting for him to pick them up.\n“It’s so much more damaging to us than anything they can make from it, it’s not like gold brick bouillon back here,” he joked.\nAs for why someone would want to steal the barrels, he’s not sure.\nOther winemakers would have been weary of the markings, realizing the barrels were likely stolen. Plus, they were specific to the wine made at Southeast Wine Collective.\n“I think this was opportunists who just found something they thought they could get a couple hundred bucks for,” he said.\nCopyright 2015 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.
