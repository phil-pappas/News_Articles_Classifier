I got everything off the truck and was in the process of unpacking, then got the phone call and rushed around to collect my gear and I got here. \n“It’s not the first time I’ve had to do something like that.” \nNo, Bachman, 28, figures this is the seventh or eighth time in his professional career he has been recalled from the minors because of a goaltending injury in the National Hockey League. \nCanucks backup Jacob Markstrom suffered a hamstring injury making a save at the end of Tuesday’s practice and will be reevaluated in a week. \nBachman backed up Ryan Miller for Wednesday’s 5-1 road win against the Calgary Flames, and will practise with the Canucks on Friday. The team, which has back-to-back games in Southern California starting Monday, was given Thursday off. \nRather than make the cannonball run across the eastern half of the United States, Bachman’s wife, Devyn, flew to Utica with the couple’s six-month-old baby from the family’s home in Denver. They missed Richard by a day. \n“And I left the apartment in a real mess,” he said. “Every year, somehow I’m never there for the unpacking process. This year, she was like: ‘I think you can unpack this year.’ I called her yesterday and said: ‘You’re unpacking. Sorry.’ \n“This is my seventh year. I’ve had one-way deals, two-way deals, been up and down. Luckily, my wife is awesome with it, and that helps. I always look at it like I’m so fortunate to be playing a kids’ game and I’m getting paid for it. I make a living, support my family. No matter what’s going on, this is a good thing, and that’s what keeps me going. We’re so fortunate to be able to play and do what we do.” \nYou can tell Bachman’s genetics include that DNA prevalent in backup goaltenders that allows them to be amiable and adaptable, and both hopeful and pragmatic. \nHe spent the last two seasons with the Edmonton Oilers — 10 games in the NHL, 75 in the American Hockey League — after shuttling between leagues as a member of the Dallas Stars’ organization the previous four years. \nBachman briefly played for Willie Desjardins when the Canucks’ coach ran Dallas’s farm team in Austin, Texas. Vancouver signed him as a free agent on July 1. \nHe has played 42 NHL games in six years, posting a 2.93 goals-against average and .904 save rate. \nBachman’s travel this week was actually fairly comfortable. He said the Oilers called him up from Oklahoma City for a game on Long Island last season and he had just enough time to take a nap before facing the Islanders. Two years ago, he arrived for a game in Los Angeles during the warm-up. \n“It’s well worth the travel and everything to get the opportunity,” he said. “I’ve had a pretty good amount of practice at it. It sounds cliché to say you take pride in putting on an NHL jersey, but it really is a special thing. You grow up watching and wanting to play, so I’m just going to keep battling.” \nFRANKIE GOES TO WHERE? Here’s one way to end the debate about the Canucks’ handling this week of prospect Frankie Corrado: The 22-year-old defenceman returns to the organization. It’s not likely, but possible. \nCorrado, claimed on waivers by the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday when the Canucks tried to assign him to the minor-league Utica Comets, was a healthy scratch when his new team lost 3-1 Wednesday to the Montreal Canadiens. Toronto has 10 defencemen, including two on injured reserve. It’s possible the Maple Leafs could decide in the next few weeks there’s no room on their roster for Corrado, who would then go back on waivers. \nThe NHL doesn’t release information on unsuccessful waiver claims, but if Toronto was the only team that bid on Corrado this week, everyone could pass on him again, which would allow the Canucks to reclaim him. And the kicker: if Corrado spent fewer than 30 days on the Leafs’ roster, the Canucks could then send him directly to Utica. \nDespite having salary-cap space and a roster spot available, the Canucks chose to waive Corrado — in theory, the team’s eighth defenceman — because they believe he will develop more playing in the American League than sitting out in the NHL. \nIt was a calculated risk that backfired when Corrado was one of the few players claimed this week. It’s naive to think general manager Jim Benning and his staff based their decision on Corrado entirely on his pre-season form, but he was still their best defence prospect until rookie Ben Hutton came along and blew everyone away in September. The salary-cap era is about managing assets, and NHL teams should try to avoid losing even modest ones for nothing. \nJAKE THE BLACK ACE: Abbotsford teenager Jake Virtanen began his NHL career as a healthy scratch Wednesday in Calgary, and the 19-year-old winger may have to sit out his first “home game” Saturday because the Canucks are unlikely to change a winning lineup. He said it will be exciting to have friends and family members coming to Rogers Arena, but it will be more exciting for them when he plays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:06:53.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
