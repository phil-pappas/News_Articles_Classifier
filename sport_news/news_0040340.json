It’s your first NHL game.” \nThe magnitude is different, all right. The media scrum for McDavid’s first NHL game included writers and TV people from all across North America, a contingent so big the Oilers had to move everyone into an adjacent room for the pre-game interview. \n“I think I’ve been handling it OK,” he said of the attention. “I’m pretty comfortable with it now. It’s something I have to get used to.” \nYup. Everywhere he goes it’s going to be McDavid! McDavid! McDavid! Opponents won’t be asked about themselves or the Oilers, but about McDavid. \nThe Blues already seemed tired of it and it was only Day 1. \n“I think everybody here understands there’s a reason for the hype behind it,” said St. Louis centre Kyle Brodziak, who played in Edmonton and knows the passion when it comes to hockey. “There’s going to have to be a certain respect level for when he’s on the ice. \n“Saying that, I don’t think you can be in awe and watching him, but everyone is going to be aware when he’s on there and focus a little extra hard on our assignments.” \nMcDavid didn’t ask for the off-ice attention. Truth be told, he’d rather not be the biggest elephant in the media circus, but that’s the way it’s going to be for a while as the Oilers go from a 30th place afterthought to front page news everywhere they visit. \nHis first trip to Toronto is going to be a gong show. Same with Montreal. And Pittsburgh, for his face-to-face with Crosby. It’ll be crazy in New York and Washington, Calgary and Vancouver. And what used to be a blah and boring trip to Buffalo will now stop traffic around the hockey world — McDavid vs Eichel I! \n“He’s working really hard to be himself and fit in, he doesn’t want to be special, he doesn’t want to be treated any differently, but he obviously is,” said head coach Todd McLellan, who can’t imagine what it’s like to be in McDavid’s position. \n“The pressures are almost three levels. One are his own individual expectations, which I’m sure are extremely high. He wants to have personal success and team success. The second pressure comes from teammates, coaching staff, organization and city. And a lot of young players have that as well. \n“Were it really changes is the national, international and world wide eyes being on him. How does that compare to some of the other players I’ve been around? I haven’t been around an 18-year-old who’s had to deal with that. It’s new for all of us.” \nMcLellan even spent time with Crosby, searching for advice on how to help McDavid adapt, but the landscape has changed so dramatically in the last 10 years that even Crosby admits he wouldn’t be equipped. \n“Even since then the world has really changed as far as the media and social media,” said McLellan. “This is a new adventure for everybody involved. \n“But I know that Connor has the tools to handle the pressure and we’ll do everything we can to help him.” \nOn the ice, everyone admits they can’t wait to see what happens, what McDavid can do when he’s fully comfortable. \n“It’s important to remember he’s only 18,” said Taylor Hall, trying to help manage the expectations a little. “I’m 23 and I still have bad games. Sidney Crosby is the best player in the world and he still has bad games. There’s going to be some trials and some errors, but he’s in a position to succeed and it’s going to be fun to watch him grow.” \nRyan Nugent-Hopkins remembers being in a similar place, a young kid with a spotlight in his face and the weight of a city on his shoulders. \n“It was a little different, we were at home, so everybody was cheering us on,” he said. “(A three-game road trip to start) is a different atmosphere, obviously. Of course there’s nerves, but once you get out there it’s a lot of fun. A lot of excitement. \n“There are a lot of pressures out there, but it will be good for him to just get out there and play.” \nFollow me on twitter.com/sun_tychkowski \nrobert.tychkowski@sunmedia.ca Oilers rookie centre Connor McDavid gets first taste of media frenzy at NHL debut in St. Louis By Robert Tychkowski , Edmonton Sun First posted: Thursday, October 08, 2015 06:05 PM MDT | Updated: Thursday, October 08, 2015 06:10 PM MDT \nST LOUIS — That’s one small step for Connor McDavid, one giant leap for the Edmonton Oilers. \nA franchise with more significant moments and chapters in NHL history than most added another one Thursday when McDavid played his first game. \nWhether it was really the hockey equivalent of watching the Beatles play their first gig remains to be seen, but the kid they’re calling the best 18-year-old to hit the big league since Sidney Crosby took his first strides, and that alone was enough to turn St. Louis into the centre of hockey universe. \n“I’m living out my dream, and there’s nothing better than that,” shrugged McDavid, who’s had a lot of big nights in his life, but none like this. “This is on a little bit of a different magnitude.
