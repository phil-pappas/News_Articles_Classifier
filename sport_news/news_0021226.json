Livingston's performance, combined with 119 yards from running back Kobe Topalian, was just what the doctor ordered for a team that lost twice by one score in the past three weeks.\n  Livingston connected with Michael Moten for a 14-yard score and a 10-7 lead in the second quarter, then found Steve Bangerter on a pretty post pattern for a 35-yard touchdown in the third quarter.\nPine View's defense forced two turnovers and sacked Gage Cuthbertson three times. Cuthbertson weaved his way for a 27-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, but missed three of the Spartans' final four possessions with a right calf injury.\n\"We're a young team,\" Pine View coach Ray Hosner said. \"We've got to get better and gotta keep working. Our defense played great.\"\nPine View linebacker Kyle Tauiliili made a big stop inside the 5-yard line that eventually held Murray to a field goal midway through the fourth quarter, then another big hit forced a fumble that effectively ended the Spartans' night.\nMurray already has clinched a tie for a playoff spot, but can guarantee a Region 4 berth with a win in its finale next week at Hillcrest.\nPine View's postseason fate is a bit more precarious. The Panthers need a win at first-place Dixie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:15:54.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
