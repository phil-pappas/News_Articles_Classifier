Back | Next Josh Galemore/Savannah Morning News - A crowd of guests come to the new River Street Sweets franchise in Pooler inside the Tanger Outlets. By Savannah Morning News TANGER GETS SWEET DEAL\nU ntil last year, River Street Sweets and Savannah’s Candy Kitchen had been friendly rivals for nearly 25 years, each successful in its own right. Siblings Jennifer and Tim Strickland operate River Street Sweets, begun by their mother in 1973. Just down the road, their father, Stan Strickland, operates Savannah’s Candy Kitchen.\nIn 2014, the two companies decided to join forces to offer franchise opportunities that bring together the best practices of each company.\nOn Friday, Glen and Liane Willard hosted the opening of the first River Street Sweets/Savannah’s Candy Kitchen franchise in Pooler’s Tanger Outlet mall. The new store will feature a variety of handmade candies, such as the group’s signature “World Famous Pralines,” old-fashioned caramel apples, homemade ice cream and chocolate loggerheads — caramel and pecans covered in chocolate to resemble a turtle.\n“We chose to name the candy after the loggerhead sea turtle, a beloved and protected local species native to our coast,” Jennifer Strickland said. As a special grand-opening event, the Strickland family will match every dollar spent on loggerheads during the weekend with a donation to the Caretta Research Project, a conservation initiative to protect loggerhead sea turtles.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: River Street Sweets/Savannah’s Candy Kitchen\nWhere: Tanger Outlets, 200 Tanger Outlet Blvd. #400, Pooler\nPhone: 912-450-9919\nWeb: For more information, go to www.riverstreetcandyfranchise.com", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14835351.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14835352.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14835350.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14835351.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14835349.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14835350.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14835349.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14835352.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:17:16.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
