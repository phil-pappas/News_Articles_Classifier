The Blackhawks, the defending Stanley Cup champions, hoping to complete their title celebration on the season’s opening night, had pulled goaltender Corey Crawford, looking to equalize against the Rangers.\nWith the puck seemingly protected under Lundqvist’s pad, Patrick Kane skated in and pushed it into the back of the net, setting off a temporary eruption inside the sold-out United Center.\nBut when a video replay supported the call on the ice — play had stopped before Kane’s potential game-tying goal — the Rangers could exhale, spoiling Chicago’s night with a 3-2 victory.\n“I could kind of feel the puck underneath my pad. I heard the whistle. I could hear it before the puck went in.”\n Tampering Claim in Case Against Patrick Kane Is Called a Hoax SEPT. 25, 2015 Derek Stepan scored what proved to be the winning goal with 59 seconds remaining in an eventful first period. Stepan followed up a shot by Kevin Hayes from just to the right of Crawford’s crease. Crawford was taken out of the play by defenseman Trevor Daley, who collided with Crawford, leaving the puck alone in front of an empty net. Stepan glided in and finished off the goal, giving the Rangers a 3-1 lead.\nPhoto Kane’s legal issues aside, his jersey, with “88” stitched on the back, was among the most popular in the crowd during the red-carpet ceremony.

We were able to hang on and find a way to win a road game.”\nThe Rangers, who waited out a 30-minute pregame ceremony during which the Blackhawks raised their third Stanley Cup banner in six years, wasted little time in quieting the crowd.\nOscar Lindberg, the 23-year-old Swedish rookie, gave the Rangers a quick 1-0 lead at 1 minute 43 seconds, beating Crawford and draining out the energy of an arena that moments earlier had been a virtual light show as images of the Blackhawks’ championship run were displayed on the ice.\nThe Chicago rookie wing Artemi Panarin scored his first N.H.L. goal at 14:24 of the first, with an assist from Kane momentarily erasing the one-goal deficit.\nBut the Rangers needed little time to regain the momentum. Kevin Klein’s goal at the 16:38 mark of the second put the Rangers up for good, backed by the support of Stepan’s late goal that gave the Rangers a two-goal cushion.\nTeuvo Teravainen drew Chicago to within a goal nearly seven minutes in the second period. But the Blackhawks were unable to solve Lundqvist, who pushed aside the 14 shots he faced in the third period, finishing with 34 saves.\n“It was a good test for us right away,” Lundqvist said. “They’re a good team, Stanley Cup champs last year, but we came out and played a simple, hard game.”\nOpening night also included the return of Kane, who was the subject of an sexual assault investigation outside of his hometown, Buffalo.\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Multiple news reports have said that Kane has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman in early August at his off-season home. While he has not been charged, Kane has been unable to shake off the weight of the inquiry or distance himself from it.\nAfter Wednesday’s morning skate, Kane sat at his locker stall inside the Blackhawks newly remodeled dressing room. For more than 20 minutes, he remained surrounded by television cameras and reporters. Kane acknowledged that he felt good physically and was mentally prepared for the season, trying to temporarily move away from his troubles.\n“I feel good when I get to the rink, to be honest with you,” Kane said. “It’s kind of like my little getaway from everything — coming here, being with the guys, playing hockey, doing things that I love. Now that I’m here, I just try to focus on that.”\nKane addressed the allegations before starting training camp last month, leaning on hockey and his teammates for support. Regaining his knack for outskating the competition and scoring, Quenneville knew, would come.\nBlackhawks Coach Joel Quenneville said Wednesday that he was pleased with how Kane had kept his focus on hockey.\n“I think he’s getting better every day,” Quenneville said Wednesday.\nBut for Kane, who has tried to keep the investigation at an arm’s length, appreciates the kind of support he received on Wednesday.\n“Anytime you go through difficult times, I guess — just to see that support whether it’s from your teammates or the fans and obviously, your family is going to be there — is pretty cool to see,” Kane said. “You never know what the reaction or the reception is going to be, but I’ve been fortunate to have that support and have the fans on my side.\n“Whether people view it as good or bad, that’s their own decision.”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/08/sports/08BLACKHAWKS2/08BLACKHAWKS2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/26/sports/26KANEweb/26KANEweb-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/08/sports/08BLACKHAWKS2/08BLACKHAWKS2-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:06:27.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
