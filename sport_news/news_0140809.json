(AP) - Darlington Nagbe scored his fourth and fifth goals of the season to lead the Portland Timbers a 4-1 victory over the Colorado Rapids on Saturday night. \nThe win, combined with other results around the league on the final day of the regular season, means Portland (15-11-8) finished in third place in the Western Conference with 53 points. The Timbers will host Sporting Kansas City in the first round of playoffs. Colorado (9-15-10) finished the season in last place in the Western Conference with 37 points. \nPortland opened the scoring in the fifth minute. After getting fouled 25 yards from goal, Nagbe dusted himself off and proceeded to bend a blistering free kick over the wall and past Colorado goalkeeper Zac MacMath for his fourth goal of the season. \nColorado tied it eight minutes later, when Dominique Badji’s shot deflected off of defender Liam Ridgewell, wrong-footing goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey and looping into the net. It was the second goal of the season for Badji. \nThe Timbers regained the lead in the 33rd minute. Lucas Melano’s cross from the right found Nagbe near the penalty spot, where the Portland forward ducked down to head a looping ball over MacMath and into the upper left corner of the goal. \nPortland added to the lead in the 63rd minute, thanks again, in part, to Nagbe. Some close, precise passes around the Colorado penalty area led to Nagbe finding Jorge Villafana on the left side of the box. The left fullback’s rocket of a shot ricocheted off of Colorado defender Sean St. Ledger and into the net for Villafana’s first goal of the season. \nFanendo Adi capped the scoring in the 88th minute, using his chest to knock in a blistering Dairon Asprilla cross from the right wing. It was Adi’s team-leading 14th goal of the season. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:46:15.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
