In an even more exciting development, the Saints won that game, 44-14, at Pikes Peak Christian on Saturday. “It was good to come out here and play,” said Saints coach Tim Pierson, whose team has had two games canceled this season. “”Pikes Peak is good team and they gave us a lot to look at.” In fairness, the Saints gave they Eagles a bit to look at, too. For example, Pikes Peak saw Saints quarterback Logan Raitt run 65 yards for a touchdown on the first play of the game. Alex Davis also rushed for a score in first quarter for a 16-0 Vail Christian lead. Although the Saints put up 337 rushing yards, which generally works, they can go by air as well. Raitt had touchdown passes to David Caballero and Davis in the second period. Ethan Kuhns scored in the fourth quarter and Raitt threw his third touchdown pass of the day, this one to Davis to finish off the Eagles. This sets up the final week of the season as a dandy. The Saints will host West Grand in what will essentially be the Central League championship game. Assistant coaches Todd Ellsworth and Sheldon Kuhns may have to be sedated for that one. The use of a tranquilizer gun aside, kickoff is at 7 p.m. on Friday at Eagle Valley. VOLLEYBALL Volleyball falls at West Grand KREMMLING — West Grand swept Vail Christian volleyball in three games, 25-16, 25-17, 25-23, to snag the Gore League title from the Saints. The Mustangs and Saints split their season series, but West Grand gets the league title on set percentage. The bigger issue is that Vail Christian has a tougher draw in the district tournament next week. The Saints will be in a pool with Paonia and a team to be determined from a play-in match. “It’s doable,” Saints coach Cathy Alexander said. “I think today was a bit of a wakeup call. You can take a loss and it can be a bad thing or you can take a loss and it’s a good thing. I think it can be a good thing.” Sports Editor Chris Freud can be reached at 970-748-2934, cfreud@vaildaily.com and @cfreud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:22:53.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
