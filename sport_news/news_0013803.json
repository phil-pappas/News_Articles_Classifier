(Photo: James Weber/The Community Recorder) Buy Photo \nA gathering of area golfers were awarded extensions to their seasons Saturday at the fifth annual Kentucky Junior Golf Foundation Senior All-Star Tournaments. \nThe top 44 boys and top 28 girls in the class of 2016 from 23 regions played one more round of golf following the completion of the state tournaments in Bowling Green, giving them a chance to make a final ceremonial swing around the state. \nPlaying on 5,508-yard, par-72 Nevel Meade Golf Course in Prospect, a pair of local players made the most of their opportunities at the Girls' Senior All-Star Tournament, where Notre Dame Academy came within a shot of putting two players in the top 10. \nErin Durstock was three shots from the lead after nine holes and finished tied for seventh with an 18-hole score of 10-over-par 82, five strokes off the winning pace set by Franklin-Simpson's Mary Joiner (77). Pandas teammate Amy Pugliano placed 11th with 83, one shot ahead of Leslie Ginter, an all-state first-team player from Henry Clay. \nDurstock and Pugliano are close friends and Northern Kentucky University golf recruits. Ever the perfectionist, Durstock was hoping for a better score in her final high school event. \n\"I didn't play that great. I only had one birdie, but it was nice being there,\" said Durstock, who battled in a tough threesome including runner-up Judianne Speach (78) of West Jessamine and third-place Rachel Fine (80) from Lexington Dunbar. \nThe city of Villa Hills had two senior all-star participants: Pugliano and Holy Cross senior Brooke Ichinose, who finished 27th. Durstock is from Fort Wright. Pandas coach Karen Henderson considered it a gift to have two Pandas put a bow on their careers at the statewide senior event. \n\"I thought Erin and Amy did well. Both were top-11,\" Henderson said. \"It was a good day. I think they appreciated it like it was icing on the cake.\" \nFor Durstock, a 2015 Kentucky Junior Ryder Cup team member, it was one final honor. Earlier in the week, she was named all-state second-team in the season-long points race that determines Mr. and Ms. Golf in Kentucky. The top 10 make the first team. Durstock tied for 15th with Grant County senior Sarah Boden. \nHeritage Academy's Trevor Yost (79) was the highest local finisher in the Boys' Senior All-Star Tournament, played Saturday at 6,665 yards at Nevel Meade. Yost tied for 16th, eight shots behind winner Jacob Cook (71) of Franklin County. Ryle's Austin Zapp (80) was three shots off the lead at the turn and finished tied for 18th. \nRyle sophomore Ryan Clements earned a boys' all-state second-team honor, finishing 19th in the points race. All-state teams are chosen by compiling points in Kentucky invitational tournaments, the regional tournaments and the state championship. \nSenior John Augenstein of Owensboro Catholic and senior Tristyn Nowlin of Madison Central were named Mr. and Ms. Golf in Kentucky. First-team players and their coaches will be honored Nov. 1 at a banquet at Big Spring Country Club in Louisville. 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1RQyMFA TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:16:07.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
