Egypt advanced far into the peninsula before being pushed back. Despite the later defeats in the 1973 war, Egypt reclaimed the Sinai and the conflict eventually led to the signing of a peace treaty with Israel.\nNo more defeats\nIn his speech, the Egyptian president stressed that the state and all its components are vigilant, ready and will not allow any defeats.\n\"The reason behind the victory in the 1973 war was the strong relationship between the Egyptian people and their army forces and this is the first lesson that we need to recall on this occasion,\" says El-Sisi.\nHe added that Egypt is still going through \"difficult times,” yet the need for life and for developing our country will not take place unless there is full support from the Egyptian people.\n\"The current government and administration are keen to achieve success just like in the past. It was the war leader's role to move towards victory and this is the second lesson,\" El-Sisi said.\nEl-Sisi explained that, \"for 20 years the military forces received half of their salaries to be able to economically fund the army.\" He added that this idea was first introduced by Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.\nThe president explained that this sacrifice helped the army buy military equipment and train the soldiers. It is unclear what time span the president was referring to.\nThe 2015 parliament, the new cabinet\n\"I ask all Egyptians to not only cast their ballots in the upcoming elections, but to also carefully choose the candidates who will be responsible for the future of Egypt.\" El-Sisi stressed.\nThe polls will be held between 17 October and 2 December and are divided into two stages, the first for voters in 14 governorates and the second for those in the remaining 13.\nEl-Sisi added that the upcoming parliament will play a crucial role as it will be the main legislative body in Egypt.\nThe president explained that the parliament will be facing many challenges. He also urged voters to cast their ballots carefully, so as to avoid the kind of protests that took place against the new civil service law.\nSpeaking about the new cabinet, the Egyptian president stressed that there is no relation between the new cabinet and the upcoming parliament.\nHe explained that as soon as a parliament is formed, according to article 146 of the 2014 constitution the cabinet head must propose a program for the elected parliament.\nAfterwards, the parliament has to give a vote of confidence in order for the cabinet to stay in power.\nThis article stipulates that \"if the government does not win the confidence of the majority of the members of the House of Representatives within thirty days at the most, the president shall appoint a prime minister who is nominated by the party or the coalition that holds the majority of seats in the House of Representatives.\"\nNew Educational program\nEl-Sisi mentioned towards the end of his speech that his government will introduce a new national science program.\n\"The project will first be introduced in Egypt and will offer free scientific education for students,\" El-Sisi said, without elaborating on the details.\nForeign policy following 30 June\nThe Egyptian president added that, during the 70th session of the general assembly, many foreign countries demonstrated their intentions to further cooperate with Egypt.\nThis understanding of the Egyptian people’s will came after talks and after showing the sincerity of our vision during the past year, says El-Sisi.\n\"Egypt is getting the treatment it deserves,” El-Sisi said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:36:58.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
