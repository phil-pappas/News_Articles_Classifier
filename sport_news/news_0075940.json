The Lions make their return to the state playoffs a year following an upset in regionals that left them on the outside looking in. ( Aaron R. Atencio / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \n4A State Softball Championships \nNo. 4 Mountain View faces No. 13 Kennedy in the first round Friday at 10 a.m. A win would pit the Lions against either Air Academy or Thompson Valley in the quarterfinals at 2:30 p.m. \n\nNo. 12 Thompson Valley takes on No. 5 Air Academy on Friday at 10 a.m. in the same bracket as MVHS. The Eagles would play at 2:30 p.m. with a first-round win. \n\nNo. 6 Berthoud matches up with No. 11 Frederick at 12:15 p.m. on Friday. A first-round victory would moved the Spartans to the quarterfinals at 2:30 p.m. against the winner of No. 3 Valor Christian or No. 14 Pueblo South. \n\nAll 4A games through the state championship will be played at Aurora Sports Park, complex B. Semifinals will be played Saturday at 10 a.m., with the championship at 1:30 p.m. \nThere was no forgetting the past or ignoring the fact that it happened. \nIt did. Mountain View was in the same exact spot a year before as a host to one of 4A's regions, everything set up in the Lions' favor to punch their ticket to the state tournament. \nA 3-2 loss to Erie in the Region 2 championship game and 7-5 defeat at the hands of Air Academy for the final state qualifying spot derailed Mountain View's season and sent it to a grinding halt. Advertisement \nNine girls from that 2014 roster returned this season and 12 months later the Lions were back. Two days before regional play the subject came up during practice. The pain a nagging reminder. \n\"I said 'you know what it feels like. You know you can't just walk in, whatever seed you are,'\" MVHS coach Randy Felton remembers. \"I told them I wanted two wins; win two and get out.\" Mountain View's Izzy Griego slides into third base earlier this season against Thompson Valley. The Lions found redemption after winning their region to earn a berth in the state tournament. ( Aaron R. Atencio / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nHis players didn't disappoint as Mountain View handled business with a 3-2 victory over Thomas Jefferson followed by a validating 14-4 dominant performance over Pueblo Central to lock up a state berth, and to a sweeter degree, a sense of redemption. \n\"It was very exciting (winning the region). That was our goal; we wanted to work hard to get these two games,\" junior third baseman Kendra Seely said. \"It was our goal last year and we just fell short. It really hurt. That experience just makes this year feel that much better. We wanted this all year, to do well in regionals, and we accomplished that.\" \nMaking it back to state and atoning for spoiling a terrific season was a motivation that burned the entire 2015 campaign for Mountain View. The Lions won the same number of games (18), lost one fewer and sealed up a Northern Conference championship (with a 13-1 record) along the way after taking second last year. \nOf the nine returning players from that devastating trip to regionals, four were starting players, including Alyssa McWilliams, Lilly Meza, Kaley Barker and Seely. Mountain View rattled off seven consecutive games to close the regular season, powered by a potent 1-9 lineup. \nThe Lions hit .406 as a team with 222 runs, 171 RBI and 73 extra-base hits (49 doubles). Barker, a sophomore, led the charge with a .577 average and a team-best 31 RBI and 41 hits. But you'd be hard pressed to find a hole in Felton's order. \n\"Last year weighed on them, the ones who played last year, I know it did,\" he said. \"I don't know if that they wanted to avenge that, but we wanted to get back and right the wrong that we had last year.\" \nWinning the region provided a more tangible benefit as well, guaranteeing Mountain View a seed somewhere in the top eight, as the Lions will enter state as the No. 4 seed facing No. 13 Kennedy (19-3) on Friday (10 a.m.) at Aurora Sports Park, complex B. \n\"It feels great, because we didn't have to go to the third game like we did last year and that pressure,\" sophomore Izzy Griego said of regionals. \"We have state to look forward to now, and I'm really excited. I hope we play well.\" \nFelton hopes so too. He's been around long enough to know the best team doesn't always win state. You need some luck, a few breaks and to enter the tournament riding a hot streak. \nMountain View hasn't lost a game since an 11-5 defeat to rival Thompson Valley back on Sept. 15, but it's the importance of the games his players faced down the stretch that has Felton liking the mental space his girls occupy. \nThe Lions needed wins against Silver Creek, Niwot and Thompson Valley once more to secure the conference title, which they did. \nBut the season isn't considered a success because they finally shrugged off the monkey from their backs. Returning to state is only the first part to a larger plan. \nMountain View is back. What will they do with the opportunity? \n\"We work hard in practice and we bond well, and I think with that we all want to do well for each other,\" Seely said. \"We wanted to get back to state; that was our goal because of last year. That was rough. \n\"I think we'll do well against any team as long as we play to our potential and work together. We're gonna work hard this week to make sure we don't waste our chance.\" \nCris Tiller: 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/rhpreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:23:04.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
