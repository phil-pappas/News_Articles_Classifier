The Jags kept it close against the Colonials in the first quarter, trailing just 13-6. Though, William Penn turned up the pressure leading into the half scoring twice in the second quarter to take a commanding 27-6 lead at the break. Appo had no answers for the electric William Penn offense in the second half as the Colonials tacked on 21 more points in the half to win going away, 48-6. The Jags are back in action next week hosting Charter School of Wilmington (1-4) Friday night at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:20:43.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
