It was a tough loss last week, and the players put it behind them and came out and battled,” Harlingen High coach Manny Gomez said. “We competed against a great football team tonight. It was just a fun evening.” \nThe Cards’ win gave Los Fresnos its first loss of the season. San Benito also handed Brownsville Veterans Memorial its first loss in a 40-21 win Friday night. Now Harlingen High, Los Fresnos, San Benito and Brownsville Veterans all have one district loss with three games to go. Harlingen High faces Brownsville Veterans next week in Brownsville. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:07:03.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
