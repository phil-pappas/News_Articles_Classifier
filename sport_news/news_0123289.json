I just thank my family, teammates and coaches for their support.” \nThe Semper Fidelis All-American Bowl will be played January 4, 2016 at StubHub Center in Carson, California. Fox Sports 1 will broadcast the game live at 8 p.m. CST. \nGraham is one of the top wide receiver talents in the state again this season. Graham has 25 receptions for 563 yards and six touchdowns through seven games this season. \nStrong family support was a key factor in Graham being able to achieve the academic and athletic success in his career, according to principal Dr. David Nordman. \n“His mom and dad are very involved in the whole process of making sure he gets his grades,” Nordman said. “They are in contact with me all the time about his work and it is the kind of involvement you look for. He is a full academic qualifier. This is positive exposure for our school. It shows what making good choices and hard work will pay off in a positive way.” \nCurrent New York Giants wide receiver Reuben Randle, a former LSU and Bastrop star, was the last All-American bowl participant in 2008 and Denzell Duval was chosen as a PrepStar All-American in 2011. \nHe is a four-star recruit that is expected to announce his college choice next Friday during a ceremony at the school. \nGraham said he has narrowed his list of five top schools to three now including Tennessee, Texas Christian and Arkansas. Graham had also previously listed Miami (Florida) and South Carolina. Graham said the recent resignation of head coach Steve Spurrier at South Carolina affected his chances of playing for the Gamecocks. \n“With the coaching staff uncertain there, it made me not want to make a move like that,” Graham said. \nConnect with Cody on Twitter @cfutrellTNS or via e-mail cfutrell@thenewsstar.com 3 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1LPECGs TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:03:20.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
