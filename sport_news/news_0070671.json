It was a gambit by Woodfin, one of the best playmakers in North Jersey, that turned into the magical moment of a lifetime for the Hawthorne Christian boys soccer team. VIOREL FLORESCU/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Hawthorne Christian’s Collin Callahan lining one up Saturday in Passaic final. \nWoodfin’s throw-in sailed into the middle of the box and was headed in for the go-ahead goal by Collin Callahan with 2:24 remaining, leading the Defenders past Wayne Valley, 2-1, in the Passaic County championship game. \nThe Callahan goal set up a big postgame celebration for Hawthorne Christian at Clifton School Stadium, as the Defenders claimed their initial Passaic crown in history in any sport – boys or girls. \n“I just was praying that the ball would find me and I would be able to connect it into the back of the net,” said Callahan, a midfielder from Bergenfield. “I saw the ball coming, I ran onto it and after that I got enough on it to push it past the goaltender. We all kept the faith and this is a great, great team reward.” \nWoodfin, a 5-foot-8, 150-pound senior midfielder from Hawthorne, leads his team with 15 assists and also has 14 goals. The throw-in by the returning first-team All-County performer was run on to by senior midfielder Michael Kriesel, who dished it off to Callahan for the game-winner. \nSecond-seeded Hawthorne Christian (14-3) opened its doors in 1981 and became a member of the NJSIAA in 1997. Before that the Defenders played mostly against other smaller private schools (such as Timothy Christian and Parsippany Christian), then joined the BCSL Olympic Division. Now, the Defenders are members of the NJIC Patriot Division. \nWith only 150 students (65 boys, 85 girls), Hawthorne Christian is the smallest high school in Passaic County and one of the smallest in the state. The giant-slaying Defenders defeated Group 4 Passaic, 3-1, in the quarterfinals and then Group 3 Wayne Hills, 5-1, in the semifinals before the triumph over Group 3 Wayne Valley. \n“We are very happy with the way we performed against some of the best and biggest schools in Passaic County,” said coach Tyler Van Dyk, who also is the athletic director and played soccer and is a 2000 graduate of the school. “Our size [20 on the roster] and our depth allowed us to succeed. We had two players injured during the game [Chris Silos, hip, and Kirk Schmidt, eye] and one other [Mike Aust] was out with a broken foot. \n“But their replacements really stepped up and delivered in championship fashion.” \nAlso suffering from the injury bug was ninth-seeded Wayne Valley (7-10-1), which was bidding for its sixth Passaic title and first since 2009. \nThe Indians, who had defeated 16th-seeded Manchester, eighth-seeded Lakeland, top-seeded-Passaic Valley in overtime and fifth-seeded Clifton in overtime to reach the final, were missing two key back-line players due to injury: senior Matt Bleeker and sophomore Aneesh Bhave. \n“I couldn’t be prouder of the way we came out and gave it everything we had today,” said Wayne Valley coach Sam Roca, whose team used a 3-5-2 alignment to good effect most of the second half. “We surprised a lot of people in this tournament, but not ourselves. Sometimes you don’t get the result you want, but we definitely put in the 100 percent effort.” \nSenior Alex Kasperowicz opened the scoring for Wayne Valley off a Hawthorne Christian miscue 11:15 into the game. Then Defenders senior forward Rene White scored his 28th goal off a Wayne Valley mistake with 23:52 left in the first half to tie it at 1.
