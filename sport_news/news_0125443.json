We’re trying to deal with some very sensitive issues and to change the culture of the game,” Le Saux told yesterday’s edition of the Times. \n“Some good people at the FA have taken a kicking after concluding there was insufficient evidence to charge Mourinho, whilst the whole furore may also deter women from becoming involved in football, as well as discouraging clubs from employing them. \n“A lot of people are working very hard to get the game in a better place, but after the last few weeks it feels as if we’ve gone back 30 years,”. \nMourinho, whose team lie 16th in the Premier League table, was given a suspended one-match ban and fined 50,000 pounds (US$77,390) by the FA on Wednesday for criticizing officials after his side’s home defeat to Southampton on October 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:23:23.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
