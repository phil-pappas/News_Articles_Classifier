With that in mind, this appears to be one of those weeks in which it would take a truly monumental upset to shake up the top of the rankings.\nBut with conference play just underway, there are still a number of contests that will help sort the contenders from the pretenders. Without further ado, here are the five games in Week 6 that will have the biggest impact on the race for the College Football Playoff.\nNo. 22 California at No. 7 Utah 10 p.m. ET, ESPN | 5dimes line: Utah by 7½\nThat other school from the Bay Area has established itself as the favorite in the Pac-12 North. But the surprising Golden Bears have a chance to match Stanford's feat of a cross-divisional road upset as they face their biggest challenge to date this season. Junior QB Jared Goff, who has already thrown for 1,630 yards and 15 TDs in 2015, is Cal's biggest reason for optimism. The Utes, however, are rested and ready. They were last seen hanging 62 on Oregon in Eugene, and the backfield duo of QB Travis Wilson and TB Devontae Booker know how to find open spaces.\nNo. 12 Florida at Missouri 7:30 p.m. ET, SEC | 5dimes line: Florida by 4\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. Just as a team in crisis has to tune out the criticism, it's just as important not to enjoy the pats on the back too much when things are going well. That's where Florida finds itself a week after its convincing win against Mississippi. In case the Gators have forgotten, this week's opponent is the defending SEC East champ, and Mizzou fans will be happy to remind them. The Tigers will once again turn to true freshman Drew Lock to quarterback the offense as Maty Mauk's suspension continues. The Gators' defense could prove harder to solve, but the Tigers have a few guys who can hit as well. Florida QB Will Grier would do well to steer clear of Mizzou LB Kentrell Brothers.\nNo. 14 Northwestern at No. 21 Michigan 3:30 p.m. ET, BTN | 5dimes line: Michigan by 7½\nFew predicted this would be the biggest game on the Big Ten slate. Given the high level at which both defenses are performing, it might be good to familiarize oneself with the opposing punters. Senior Blake O'Neill has a solid 40.71-yard average for the Wolverines, but the Wildcats' Hunter Niswander isn't far behind at 38.93.\nNorthwestern linebacker Anthony Walker (18) has been a vital key to the Wildcats' outstanding defense this seaso. (Photo: Caylor Arnold, USA TODAY Sports)\nNo. 2 TCU at Kansas State 7:30 p.m. ET, FOX | 5dimes line: TCU by 10\nBoth Big 12 co-champs from 2014 are venturing up to the Sunflower State, though Baylor's visit to Lawrence does not figure to be quite as taxing. The Horned Frogs have been hard to stop themselves, though the Wildcats defense is always well-drilled and will be paying special attention to QB Trevone Boykin's primary target, WR Josh Doctson. K-State hasn't quite reached the point of scouting intramural flag games around the campus for a back-up QB, but the position is getting a bit thin. The good news for the Wildcats is Joe Hubener has been through concussion protocols and has been cleared to play this week.\nUSA TODAY\nThe Football Four Podcast breaks down Week 6's best matchups\nMiami at No. 8 Florida State 8 p.m. ET, ABC | 5dimes line: Florida State by 8½\nFor the Seminoles to have a realistic chance of being in the Playoff conversation, they must have a clean record heading into their Nov. 7 game at Clemson. The Hurricanes, battling fan discontent and coming off a non-conference setback at Cincinnati, have a chance to start over as they enter ACC play. Miami QB Brad Kaaya has been through the wringer before, but the FSU defense he faces has been the main reason the Seminoles have survived to this point. FSU QB Everett Golson hasn't made any devastating mistakes — FSU does not have an offensive turnover this season — but he might need to take more chances in the passing game if top TB Dalvin Cook (hamstring) is unable to play.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST Five can't-miss college football games for Week 6 | 02:18 USA Today Sports' George Schroeder breaks down this week's best games.
