Michael has got the team playing better football than any Northern Ireland team I've ever seen.\" \nFrampton was not born when Billy Bingham took the country to the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and although the outcome was a good one, he confessed to a nervy night beforehand. \n\"Northern Ireland were last at a tournament in 1986 and I was born in 87, it's the first tournament of my lifetime and a first ever European Championship. It's going to be huge,\" he said. \n\"It's so exciting it took me a while to get to sleep the night before the match, I was worrying about the game and how much it means. \n\"I'm usually pretty cool when I'm fighting, I don't have trouble sleeping because I'm the one in control, but I was nervous for the game. \n\"I can't really book anything until I have the dates of my next fights but if I can make it to France I'll be there.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:50:37.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
