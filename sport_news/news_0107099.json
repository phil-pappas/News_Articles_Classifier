Through two games of the AHL season, the Moose are contending with some penalty problems of their own. \nPenalties left the Moose playing without the puck for much of a 3-2 shootout loss in front of 2,925 at Ricoh Coliseum on Saturday afternoon that completed a two-game season-opening series. Toronto outshot the Moose 41-29. The Moose surrendered five Toronto power plays, all of them in the first 23:54 of the game. \n“I really liked the effort,” Moose head coach Keith McCambridge said. “Again, to push back like that at the end showed a lot out of the short amount of time in the season that we've gotten to know each other. A little bit of penalty trouble got us chasing the game, but I liked the 5-on-5 play in both games. We really need to clean up our defensive zone.” \nMcCambridge elected to give rookie goaltender Eric Comrie his season debut after Connor Hellebuyck’s busy workload Friday. Comrie finished with 39 saves and anchored the Moose early when Toronto had outshot the Moose 33-16 through two periods. \n“He's a gamer,” defencemen Josh Morrissey said of Comrie. “He shows up every night. He prepares to play like no one else you've ever seen. He was outstanding.” \nJC Lipon delivered his first goal of the season for the Moose, who tied the game at 2-2 with 1:51 left in regulation on a goal from Ryan Olsen. Byron Froese and Andrew Campbell tallied for the Marlies, who received 27 saves from goaltender Garret Sparks. Froese’s shootout tally won the game. \nForward Thomas Raffl did not dress after sustaining a crushing mid-ice hit Friday. Rookie Jimmy Lodge dressed in Raffl’s place Saturday. \nLipon, who remained with the Jets deep into training camp before his assignment to the AHL, crashed the Toronto net before taking John Albert’s pass into the slot and directing it past Sparks at 7:53. \nAfter Lipon’s goal, the Moose ran into the same penalty trouble that plagued them in the loss Friday. Three consecutive minor penalties left the Moose shorthanded for 5:13 late in the first period, including two separate 5-on-3 kills that they survived. \nMore penalty trouble arose in the second period. Consecutive minors to veteran defencemen Andrew MacWilliam and Jay Harrison put the Marlies on their third two-man advantage of the game. A dangerous Toronto power play that includes William Nylander, the eighth pick in the 2014 NHL Draft, pinned in the Moose low in the defensive zone. Froese, a Winkler product, managed to push a shot through Comrie’s pads at 5:24. \nCampbell’s second goal in as many games made it 2-1 at 10:48. Moose defenceman Jan Kostalek put an attempted clearing pass from behind the net into the high slot that Campbell intercepted and snapped past Comrie. \nBut the Moose stayed out of the penalty box in the second half of the game and kept pressing. It paid off late in the third period. \nMatt Halischuk’s rush into the Toronto zone set up Olsen’s tying goal. Chase De Leo worked Halischuk’s rebound to the slot for Olsen to backhand past Sparks. \n“That's a really good quality for a young team to have, to not just fold up the tents, to continue to push on, scrape and claw and get yourselves back in the game,” McCambridge said. “That's a really good building block for character in that room.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:45:09.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
