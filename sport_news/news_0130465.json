Even fans that tailgated were subdued. The most pitiful sight were the entrepreneurs charging $20 per car to park in businesses and homes on Nicholson Drive heading south from downtown. They obviously forgot or ignored the fact LSU allowed free parking for this game as a gesture to the fans that did bother to attend.\nLSU athletic director Joe Alleva, who said he and his staff began preparing on Monday to possibly play the host with the most, had hoped to sell 50,000 tickets.\nThere's a thought that LSU would have reached that number if tickets had been discounted from the $75 face value, but South Carolina (which got all the gate and concession money after stadium expenses) and LSU agreed to charge full price.\n\"The price was still cheaper than most SEC game tickets,\" Alleva said. \"I don't think selling a cheaper ticket would have made a difference. People make plans in advance for the Saturdays we're on the road. I invited five different people to sit in my box with me and all of them had made prior plans.\"\nLSU fans got in the spirit of making the displaced Gamecocks feel at home. They cheered when South Carolina ran on the field just before kickoff, with a portion of the LSU band standing near the visiting dressing room entrance where they played the Gamecocks' fight song.\n\"Visiting\" LSU fans welcome South Carolina LSU fans in Baton Rouge welcome the fans of the \"home team\" Gamecocks after the SEC game was moved from flood-ravaged South Carolina.\n\"When we got word this week that the game was going to be here, we realized the stadium wasn't going to be full,\" said LSU sophomore receiver Malachi Dupre, who had a career-high six catches for 74 yards and his second TD in the last three games. \"We also knew we were going to show South Carolina a lot of hospitality to make them feel like it was their home away from home. We did that, but when the kickoff started, it was SEC football.\"\nBy day's end, the Tigers had rolled for 624 yards of total offense, the most against an SEC team since steamrolling Ole Miss for 630 yards in a 42-13 victory in 1987.\nFournette had his string of three consecutive 200-yard rushing games snapped, finishing with 158 yards on 20 carries, thanks to his game-breaking run on his 17th carry of the game that awoke the Tigers from their 17-10 halftime slumber against one of the SEC's worst defenses.\nAfter three more carries on the next series, Fournette sat the rest of the game. He was delighted to see Guice run for a game-leading 161 yards and a TD (\"Derrius is a wild child, he hates the ground,\" Fournette said) and Darrel Williams add 61 yards and two TDs to complete a Tigers' rushing attack that gained 396 yards on 54 carries.\n\"He hits the one (the long TD) in the second half,\" LSU coach Les Miles said of Fournette, \"and I'm thinking, 'Let's get him out of here. . .we want to keep him fresh.\"\nSouth Carolina coach Steve Spurrier discusses 45-24 loss at LSU Tigers pull away from Gamecocks in third quarter\nSaturday was the first time this season an opposing defense opened the game absolutely hellbent on stopping Fournette. South Carolina often jumped eight to nine defenders in the box, daring LSU sophomore quarterback Brandon Harris to beat the Gamecocks with his passing.\nIt's something that LSU knew was coming and something the Tigers (5-0, 3-0 in the West Division) should expect the rest of the season, especially next Saturday in Tiger Stadium against Florida. The unbeaten 11th-ranked Gators entered their game at Missouri Saturday night with the SEC's second-best rushing defense, allowing just 97.8 yards per game.\nHarris' most extensive passing performance of his young career – 18-of-28 for 228 yards and two touchdowns – certainly wasn't for the faint of heart.\nIt wasn't because of his lack of accuracy, but rather his bravado in the pocket. Harris often held the ball so friggin' long in the pocket in the face of a Gamecocks' pass rush it was like watching a squirrel calmly clutching an acorn on a road full of oncoming traffic.\n\"They played a Tampa 2 defense and rushed four, so when you're running routes against that zone, you've got to hold it, anticipate and wait for the window to come open,\" Harris said. \"I just tell my offensive line all the time, 'Give me protection and I'll make it happen.'\"\nAfter seven dropped passes the last two weeks by LSU's wide receivers, they were almost perfect against South Carolina, which fell to 2-4 overall and 0-4 in the SEC's East Division.\nEven a pass that deflected off the hands of Tigers' tight end DeSean Smith ricocheted a la Bluegrass Miracle to Travin Dural, who caught the ball in stride for a 65-yard TD that gave the Tigers a 31-10 lead with 6 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter.\nPass wasn't intended for him, but LSU's Travin Dural made the big play | Video He hauled in a 62-yard TD pass on a deflected pass\n\"I'm not sure how it happened,\" Dural said. \"I ended up in the right place in the right time with the ball.\"\nAs with any of LSU's victories this season, it wasn't flawless. There were a couple of pass coverage busts that resulted in South Carolina TDs. The kickoff coverage team fell apart again, allowing a 96-yard TD return by freshman Rashad Fenton.\nBut by the end of the day, everyone felt a bit better regardless who won or who lost.\nMiles didn't mind the small crowd – \"They sounded just like 100,000 to me,\" he said.\nHarris loved the Tigers' offensive efficiency – \"If we continue to play balanced like this, the sky's the limit.\"\nSouth Carolina quarterback Perry Orth was touched by the reception he and his teammates received – \"It was awesome for their (LSU) band to play our alma mater, and those guys on the other team were awesome. They told us to keep our heads up about our situation going on at home. Hats off to their guys and Coach Miles.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:01:50.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
