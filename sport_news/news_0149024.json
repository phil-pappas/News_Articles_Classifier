They lost both the Egyptian Premier League and the Egypt Cup to archrivals Zamalek.\nNew coach after the Super Cup\nChief of Ahly's youth sector, Zizo, will be in charge of Ahly until the derby match against archrivals Zamalek in the Super Cup. The match will be played on 15 October in the United Arab Emirates.\n\"The name of the new coach has not been decided yet. The announcement will be made after the Super Cup match,\" explained President Taher.\nLocal reports said on Monday that Portuguese coach Jose Vitor dos Santos Peseiro is reportedly in the running for the vacant Ahly job but no deal is in place yet.\nPeseiro, who started his coaching career in 1992, was one of Carlos Queiroz’s assistant coaches at Real Madrid and was part of Manchester United's backroom staff.\nPeseiro is not the only candidate for the Ahly job as the names of German coach Thomas Schaaf, former Werder Bremen coach and Marcos Bakita are also on the table.\nVeteran Portuguese coach Manuel Jose Da Silva, who guided Ahly to various trophies before, also emerged as a prominent candidate.\n\"It isn't true that I had a meeting with Peseiro in London. All the names discussed in Egyptian media are just rumours. Until now we are not talking about certain names,\" Mahmoud Taher explained.\n\"I promise the fans a new coach who will be able to meet their hopes and aspirations,\" the Ahly chairman concluded.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T04:34:03.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
