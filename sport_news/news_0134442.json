And Shields added, \"Every time we fight overseas, the women always do better than the men.\"\nThere's a reason, she said. \"Guys don't know how to let the ego go,\" she said. \"They sometimes think, 'I'm a man. I know how to fight. All I need is to have the judges on my side.' That keeps them from listening to coaches, or concentrating on conditioning.\"\nShields, 20, added that she and her fellow competitors will have to win three fights when they step into the ring this week in Memphis. \"We're fighting just to be on Team USA. We're fighting against people who say women can't fight, that they aren't skilled. And we have to prove ourselves to the judges.\"\n\"I like to be positive, while thinking realistic,\" said Mike Martino, executive director of USA Boxing. \"Women's boxing is much more competitive now than in 2012. But Claressa is a special athlete in that boxing seems to come so naturally for (her). Marlen has skills and loads of experience, and coming off wins in the World Championships you'd have to see them as favorites. And I'm excited about how competitive we'll be in all three weight divisions in Rio.\"\nAction starts at noon Monday with more than 400 men seeking one of the final 20 spots in the U.S. Olympic Men's Team Trials in Reno, Nevada, Dec. 7-12.
