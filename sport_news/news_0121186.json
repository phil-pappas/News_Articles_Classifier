A penalty from wide out hit a post and Edinburgh messed up their clearance so Ospreys gained a much easier chance, which was struck home by fly-half Davies. \nDavies added another, much longer effort, in the 17th minute following an Edinburgh scrum offence to make it 6-0. \nIn a dull encounter Edinburgh had hardly been in the Ospreys' 22 until full-back Tonks pushed them to its edge with a penalty in the 29th minute. \nEdinburgh then remained deep in Ospreys territory until stand-off Burleigh glided in for his try nine minutes later. In between referee Andrew Brace had awarded five penalties to Edinburgh and sent Ospreys loosehead prop Nicky Smith to the sin-bin. \nTonks kicked a good conversion to put Edinburgh 7-6 ahead, but there was time for a third Davies penalty so Ospreys went in at the interval leading by two points. \nEdinburgh, though, regained the lead with a penalty from Tonks eight minutes after the restart, and never relinquished it after that. \nSoon after they gained another in kickable range, after the first free-flowing rugby of the evening, but chose to go for touch and made nothing of the chance. \nHowever, when the next award arrived, with Ospreys sub Olly Cracknell dispatched to the sin-bin for obstruction, Tonks struck it home. \nEdinburgh dominated the closing stages but messed up a scoring chance as Andries Strauss failed to hold the ball as he dived over the line. \nBut with four minutes left yet another penalty, line-out, drive sequence ended with the pack going over by the Ospreys posts with Andress touching down and substitute Jack Cuthbert converting. \nIn a fortnight Edinburgh are again at home to face Ulster while Ospreys travel to face Treviso still looking for a first win.
