(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) \nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) — Christian Hackenberg threw for 262 yards, two touchdown passes, ran for two more and Penn State beat Indiana 29-7 on Saturday. \nHackenberg was 21 of 39 and hit Brandon Polk and DaeSean Hamilton on 39-yard scoring strikes and turned a bootleg into a 1-yard touchdown run for a 19-7 halftime lead. He scrambled for a 5-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter and Tyler Davis kicked a 30-yard field goal to cap the scoring. \nZander Diamont scored on a 12-yard run for the Hoosiers (4-2, 1-2 Big Ten) but completed just 9 of 17 passes for 90 yards and was benched for third-stringer Danny Cameron in the third quarter. \nCameron didn’t fare any better against Penn State’s defense. Senior defensive end Carl Nassib forced two fumbles and finished with two sacks. Austin Johnson and Garrett Sickels each had a sack and the Nittany Lions (5-1, 2-0) forced six 3-and-outs.
