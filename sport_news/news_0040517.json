Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch will not make the trip to Cincinnati for Sunday’s contest against the Bengals as the team hopes another game off will help his ailing hamstring get fully healthy.\nCoach Pete Carroll said after Friday’s practice that Lynch may have been able to play against the Bengals but that the team hopes holding him out will prevent a re-injury that could have caused a longer absence down the road.\nThe team listed Lynch as out for Sunday’s game and Carroll said Lynch would not make the flight back with the team for the game.\n“He actually did get a little bit of work (in practice) and he is running very well,’’ Carroll said of Lynch, who hurt his hamstring late in the second quarter of the Chicago game on Sept. 27. “However it’s just two weeks now. He’s just getting over it. We’ve seen some guys around the league try to come back. He could try to come back and play, but we think he’d be vulnerable. He needs another weekend to get through it. Then by next week, by Wednesday or something, we think we can get him going again. He’s just about over the hump. He’s worked very diligently, like I’ve said, to get it done. So we just have to wait a couple more days.”\nThe hope is Lynch will be able to play on Oct. 18 against Carolina without as much worry of a setback.\nCarroll said Lynch has a hamstring strain and said that two weeks is roughly the time that the team had envisioned. He practiced on a limited basis on Thursday, raising some hopes he might make it back before Friday’s decision to have him sit out.\n“If it’s a legit hammy [hamstring] that’s going to bother him, then that means there’s some tissue that’s damaged,” Carroll said. “You’ve just got to wait it out. He’s very close, but we can’t guarantee that he can make it through the game. That means we could get set back again, so we’re just going to wait it out and see if we can get him right next week.”\nLynch also sat out Monday night’s 13-10 win over the Lions, snapping a streak of 61 straight regular-season games played that dated to 2011. Lynch was hurt when he made a reception to convert a fourth-down play late in the second quarter against the Bears.\nHowever, Carroll said backup running back Fred Jackson has made “a miraculous’’ recovery from a high ankle sprain suffered Monday night and while listed as questionable could be able to play.\n“We are thinking he’s going to make it,’’ Carroll said. “He’ll have to workout on gameday but he looks really good and we think he’s going to be able to play.’’\nCarroll said further of Jackson that “he’s way ahead of schedule. Just can’t figure out how he’s doing it. But he looks ready to go.”\nSo that means the tailback duties will fall to Thomas Rawls and Jackson on Sunday.\nAsked if the team could make a move to add depth at running back, Carroll said “we may.’’ One option could be adding Rod Smith from the practice squad, though that would require moving another player off the active 53-man roster. The team did not make any official transactions on Friday.\nHere are some other notes:\n— Asked if the offensive line will stay the same, Carroll said “yes, for the most part.’’ He hinted that the team could also use Patrick Lewis at center along with Drew Nowak. When asked if Lewis might play he said “Yeah, Patrick could play. He’s ready to go.’’Carroll said the team has made some adjustments to things on the offensive line but said he would not detail what those are.\n— Carroll said the surgery to repair a broken thumb on Marcus Burley “went great’’ and that he could be back in three weeks or so. That will likely have DeShawn Shead playing nickel against the Bengals, however. As for Burley, Carroll said “really this is an amazing turnaround from a legit broken thumb and all. But the surgery supposedly went great and maybe in three weeks from now he has a chance to get back out there.”\n— Carroll said DB Steven Terrell will play after missing the last two games with a hip flexor and said he can help add depth at cornerback.\n— Carroll said rookie DB Tye Smith is battling a hip inury and his status for the game is uncertain.\n— Carroll hinted that the team could be making a roster move with Tharold Simon, who remains out with a dislocated toe. Asked to clarify the situation with Simon, he said: “He dislocated his second toe and he’s got kind of, his nature has given him a toe that’s got some issues and we’ve just got to work through it. He’s had surgery on his other foot (causing him to miss his rookie year in 2013) — same toe, same situation. And so that’s something we are trying to work through right now and see if that’s necessary or not.’’\n— LB Kevin Pierre-Louis will make the trip but has a sore shoulder and is listed as doubtful.\nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
