Johansen’s Cavaliers will take on McClain in Week 7. (Photo: Gazette file photo) 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMcClain (0-6) at Chillicothe (4-2) \n• In 2014: Chillicothe won 35-0. \n• Last week: The Tigers lost 32-13 to Miami Trace; the Cavaliers defeated Hillsboro 14-6. \n• Outlook: After losing their first two games in 2015, Chillicothe has ripped off four straight wins — three of which have come inside SCOL play. On the other hand, McClain hasn’t won a football game since November of 2013. With running back Nate Rosenbauer on another planet right now when it comes to dominant play in the backfield, the Cavaliers should be 5-2 heading into Week 8’s showdown with Clinton-Massie. The only thing in the Tigers’ favor here may be inclement weather and the fact that the Cavaliers could get caught looking ahead. Other than that, it should be all Cavaliers. \nAdena (4-2) at Zane Trace (6-0) \n• In 2014: Zane Trace won 21-14. \n• Last week: The Warriors defeated Huntington 21-0; the Pioneers defeated Paint Valley 15-8 in overtime. \n• Outlook: The Pioneers just keep rolling and proving people wrong. With wins now over Logan Elm and Paint Valley, Zane Trace has solidified themselves as ‘for real’. Having said that, they’ll have to continue the streak without starting quarterback Joel Dunkle — who will be sidelined with an ankle injury. Backup quarterback Austin Harris did a nice job in relief of Dunkle during the second half and overtime periods of last week’s win. We’ll see how he deals with a start this week. One other worry that could dethrone Zane Trace could be the two-headed monster that is Adena’s Cale Free and Isaac Thomas. Both will be coming into the contest with over 400 yard rushing and five scores each. Paint Valley’s Teagan McFadden managed just 21 yards rushing against Zane Trace’s defensive front one week ago. If Free and Thomas have the same luck, the Pioneers will be 7-0. \nSoutheastern (1-5) at Paint Valley (5-1) \n• In 2014: Paint Valley won 30-0. \n• Last week: The Panthers lost 21-14 to Unioto; the Bearcats lost 15-8 to Zane Trace in overtime. \n• Outlook: After last week’s loss in Kinnikinnick, Paint Valley coach Pete Hollon was anything but happy. To me, that means his Bearcats worked harder than they ever have in practice this week. The Bearcats are still ranked number four in the OHSAA Division VI, Region 21 playoff rankings so they will need to keep winning. Trying to negate that from happening will be a Southeastern team that has nothing to lose. The Panthers haven’t had the best of luck this year with taking care of the ball. To beat the Bearcats, they’ll have to control possession and keep the Bearcats’ offense off the field. A tall task for a team that’s lost 15 of their last 16. \nWestfall (1-5) at Unioto (3-3) \n• In 2014: Unioto won 34-8. \n• Last week: The Mustangs lost 38-14 to Piketon; the Shermans defeated Southeastern 21-14. \n• Outlook: The records may not show it but this could very well be a toss-up. Westfall’s Mason Peart and Matt Jude are a combo that, when given the chance, can take over a game. Unioto’s defense will have to come to play in this one. On the offensive side for Unioto, it’s simple: continue to let Clay Edler be Clay Edler. The junior quarterback has progressed nicely as a starter over the past three weeks so why impede that process now? To go along with that, the Tanks are a different team with running back Andrew Oyer on the field as we learned when he was out due to injury. Oyer will be present Friday night and that bodes well for the Shermans. \nPiketon (3-3) at Huntington (0-6) \n• In 2014: Piketon won 34-16. \n• Last week: The Redstreaks defeated Westfall 38-14; the Huntsmen lost 21-0 to Adena. \n• Outlook: It seems as if Piketon is this year’s perfect example of Jekyll and Hyde. Sometimes they look great, sometimes they look terrible. But against a Huntington team that is extremely down this year, I don’t see it mattering which version of the Redstreaks shows up. One positive the Huntsmen do have going for them is the play of freshman quarterback Elijah McCloskey. With experience comes wisdom and McCloskey has plenty of time to learn. It may not seem like much now but in a few years, McCloskey could be one of the top quarterbacks around the area. \nWaverly (3-3) at Wheelersburg (6-0) \n• In 2014: Wheelersburg won 35-14. \n• Last week: The Tigers lost 35-14 to Lucasville Valley; the Pirates defeated Oak Hill 48-0. \n• Outlook: The road to the playoffs doesn’t get any easier for Waverly, who was at one time very much in playoff contention. However, with losses over the past two weeks and a match-up with Wheelersburg in Week 7, things are looking grim. Waverly’s game plan will have to take after Southeastern’s in the form of holding the ball and moving the chains. That can happen with running backs Drew Harris and Tyrell Chenoweth. But execution is key and executing anything against a Pirates’ team that’s giving up just 4.7 points per game is much easier said than done. \ndwebb@chillicothegazette.com \nTwitter: @dw1509 \nFollow the Chillicothe Gazette’s live game updates from Adena at Zane Trace (@dw1509), McClain at Chillicothe (@SirBrockNetter), Westfall at Unioto (@MrZacharyMax) and Southeastern at Paint Valley (@hillcollin8), Friday night on Twitter at hashtag #cghss .
