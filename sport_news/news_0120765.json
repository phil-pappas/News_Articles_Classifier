(AP) - A renewed federal grant of $300,000 is going to help veterans with disabilities get assistance through a University of New Hampshire program.\nThe program, called Northeast Passage, has been working with veterans for 10 years to provide adaptive sports and recreation therapy.\nThe last grant from the Veterans Administration helped 271 veterans last year, and demand is expected to grow this year. Most of the veterans are from new Hampshire, but others come from Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts.\nProgram director Jill Gravink says before these grants, there were limitations from other funding sources that tended to focus on physical disabilities from the recent era. She said post-traumatic stress disorder is a big concern, especially with Vietnam veterans, and the grants will help with treatment.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
