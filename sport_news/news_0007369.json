The Lady Eagles faced their Area 5 rival once during the regular season, losing in straight sets Sept. 1.“I’m proud of the tremendous group of girls that we have,” Etowah coach Kim Robertson said. “We have a senior-loaded bunch of girls who have worked hard. They’re doing a super job and they’ve earned that accomplishment.”Paige Horton led the way for Etowah with 17 kills, while Natalie Lucco added 16 and Nicole Ferris had 11. Jessie Cohen (40 assists) and Madeline Gilmer (26 digs) were also key contributors.East Coweta (25-22) fought Etowah on even terms early in the first set and only trailed 6-5 as it took advantage of three unforced errors by the Lady Eagles.Etowah, however, responded with a 6-0 run to take a 12-5 lead and maintained control through the rest of the set. Horton contributed four kills to spur the run.East Coweta had the early advantage in the second set as two kills by Dominique Ingram helped give the Lady Indians a 3-2 lead.That, however, was the last time East Coweta led in the second set as a kill by Lucco and an ace by Cohen helped spark a 4-0 run that put Etowah in front for good.East Coweta had the upper hand at the beginning of the third set as two kills by Ingram and three Etowah unforced errors put the Lady Indians ahead 7-4, but the Lady Eagles surged right back with a 6-0 run as Ferris came up with a kill and two aces. Horton had a kill and East Coweta had two unforced errors to give the Etowah a 10-7 lead.East Coweta stayed close and cut its deficit to one at 11-10, but the Lady Eagles came up big once again with an 11-2 run to pull away and clinch the match as well as their semifinal berth.“(East Coweta is) a well-coached team with a very talented middle (Ingram). When she was in the mix, they were always in the match,” Robertson said. “I thought we did a good job of controlling the middle, and our other hitters came through, and I think that was the key.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:14:12.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
