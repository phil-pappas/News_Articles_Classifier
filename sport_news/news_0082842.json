[ South Africa series: India Test squad named; Jadeja recalled ] \n\"Feel sorry for Yuvraj. Maybe the selectors could have given him one last fling at glory: Gavaskar told NDTV. \n[ Ranji Trophy: Yuvraj Singh smashes 187 as Punjab take 1st innings lead ] \nGavaskar however, maintained that he wasn't surprised when Yuvraj was not included in the team. \n\"If Harbhajan (Singh) and Yuvraj (Singh) are in form, then why not pick them? Youth and experience are important for the team. Dropping Yuvraj is not surprising. I thought he had a chance after Harbhajan was recalled,\" he further told NDTV. \nLeft-handed all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who has had an impressive Ranji Trophy season so far, was today recalled to the Indian Test squad to face South Africa. Veteran offspinner Harbhajan Singh was dropped. \nThe BCCI selection committee, led by Sandeep Patil, on Monday (October 19) announced a 16-man Indian Test squad for the first 2 matches of the 4-game home series against South Africa. \nVirat Kohli will lead the Test side against South Africa. This is the first home series for him since taking over the reins from MS Dhoni, who quit Tests in December last year. \nPaceman Ishant Sharma, who was injured during a Ranji Trophy game on Saturday (October 17) has made the cut. However, he will miss the 1st Test due to a ban imposed on him by ICC. \nThe 26-year-old Jadeja, who is the leading wicket-taker in the ongoing Ranji Trophy with 24 scalps (4 five-wicket hauls) from 2 games for Saurashtra at an outstanding average of 8.24, has returned on sheer weight of performance. He has also hit 2 half centuries. Jadeja has made a comeback to the Indian team after 4 months. He last played in a ODI in Bangladesh on June 18. \nIndia Test squad for 1st 2 matches of Gandhi-Mandela Series \nVirat Kohli (captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Murali Vijay, KL Rahul, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Wriddhiman Saha (wicketkeeper), Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Varun Aaron, Stuart Binny, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav. \nIn: Ravindra Jadeja, Murali Vijay, Wriddhiman Saha \nOut: Karun Nair, Harbhajan Singh, Naman Ojha \nBoard President's XI squad for 2-day practice game (October 30-31) in Mumbai Vs South Africa \nCheteshwar Pujara (captain), KL Rahul, Unmukt Chand, Karun Nair, Shreyas Iyer, Naman Ojha (wicketkeeper), Hardik Pandya, Jayant Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav, Shradul Thakur, Sheldon Jackson, Karn Sharma, Nathu Singh. \nTest schedule \nNovember 5-9 (Thursday to Monday): 1st Test, Mohali \nNovember 14-18 (Saturday to Wednesday): 2nd Test, Bengaluru \nNovember 25-29 (Wednesday to Sunday): 3rd Test, Nagpur \nDecember 3-7 (Thursday to Monday): 4th Test, New Delhi \nSouth Africa Test squad \nHashim Amla (captain), AB de Villiers (vice-captain), Temba Bavuma, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Dean Elgar, Simon Harmer, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn, Stiaan van Zyl, Dane Vilas (wicketkeeper). \nOneIndia News Read more about: Other articles published on Oct 19, 2015 Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:23:30.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
