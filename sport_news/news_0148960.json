For Live Oak, 42 is the answer to a much different question: How to win the game. \nThe Acorns improved to 4-0 this season by winning their first Mt. Hamilton Division game by putting up, that’s right, 42 points. \nBut unlike the previous three games where 42 points allowed the Acorns win cruise to a win, against Leigh Friday night, Live Oak needed every one of those points. \nLive Oak took down the Longhorns 42-28 in a game where Live Oak didn’t get off to a great start, but dominated in the second half. \nThe win ended Leigh’s three-game winning streak but the Longhorns didn’t go down without a fight. \nFor the first time this season, Live Oak had to play from behind and it was the first time the Acorns didn’t have a big lead going into halftime. \nThe Acorns, however, got a big night out of quarterback Erik Ornduff, who threw for 210 yards and three touchdowns and ran in a fourth. He was an efficient 10-15 passing. \n“He’s coming into his own a little bit this year,” said coach Mike Gemo. “He’s made some throws. We’ve got to work on some things with him, but he’s a (heck) of a quarterback and he’s the leader of this team. \nMitch Conforti caught five of those passes for 85 yards and a touchdown, including a 58-yard pass play where he was just caught from behind to be denied the endzone a second time. \nIsaac Nfon also caught a 55-yard touchdown on what proved to be the score that put the game out of reach. \nPaul Lomanto ran for 93 yards on 10 carries and caught three passes for 40 yards and a touchdown. \nLive Oak trailed 14-0 before it could even blink as Leigh capitalized on a fumble on the opening kickoff and excellent field position after the Acorns punted to end their first series. \n“It happened so quick,” Conforti said of how Live Oak kept its collective head in the game and not be demoralized. “It was only in the first quarter and it was only 4 minutes and something to play. We knew we had the rest of the game to play.” \nJacob Ryder fumbled as he was returning the opening kickoff, giving the Longhorns the ball on the Acorn 17. \nTwo plays and a sack later, Jacob King hit Greg Le for a 25-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead just 58 seconds into the game. \nLeigh then got the ball back on the Live Oak 39 and punched it in for a 14-0 lead just four plays later as King ran the ball in from one yard out. \nThe ensuing kickoff, the man who got Live Oak into the early jam made sure he was the spring board to get them out of it. \nRyder fielded the kick at the 20 and took it 80 yards, breaking tackles and getting great blocking along the way for a touchdown to make the game 14-7. \n“I was upset about the fumble. I had to catch up. It was 14-0 them. And it sprung us. It was what I had to do,” Ryder said. \nAnd the defense answered the challenge. \n“I think we were a little tight in the beginning and it was what we needed to wake up,” Gemo said. \nAfter Leigh moved into Live Oak territory, pushing the ball down to the Acorn 30 for a third and short play, the Longhorns were called for holding to negate a first down. Leigh could only get back to the original line of scrimmage before punting. \nThe punt was bad, netting just six yards. Live Oak took advantage, as Ryder moved the ball to midfield on three carries. \nOrnduff then hit two big pass plays to get Live Oak into the Red Zone where the drive stalled. \nBut on fourth and 5 from the Leigh 6, Ornduff found Mitch Conforti on a short dump off and the receiver won a foot race to the endzone to tie the game, 14-14 ealry in the second quarter. \nLeigh’s ensuing possession ended with a fumble that Ryan Quadros recovered on the Longhorn 15 and Ryder took it the rest of the way for his second touchdown of the night. \nRyder went 15 yards on one play for a 21-14 lead with 8:26 left in the half. \nBut Leigh wasn’t done, either. \nLive Oak had a drive stall deep in its own territory and forced to punt from its own 1, setting up the Longhorns on the Acorn 20. \nTwo plays later, Michael Brohn took the ball 12 yards to tie the game 21-all and that’s where things stood at halftime. \nIn the second half, things dramatically swung in Live Oak’s favor. \n“We gave up seven points in the second half. That was huge,” Gemo said. “They’re (the defense) playing really well right now, but we’ve got to clean up some stuff and move on to Leland next week.” \nLeigh’s first play of the half ended in a fumble, scooped up by Tommy Coreas. \nThree plays later, Ornduff found the back of the endzone on a run to the front corner of the endzone and a 28-21 lead. \nLeigh’s next drive looked to fizzle deep in its own territory when a muffed punt gave the Longhorns new life. \nGetting the ball on the Live Oak 37, King threw three straight incompletions, including a drop that would have been an easy score. \nOn fourth and 10, King attempted to run, but gained just two yards on the play. \nIt was the first of three times in the half that Live Oak’s defense held on fourth down. \nRyder gave credit for the defense to one of the smaller guys on the field who helped breakup a few pass plays. \n“I don’t know if you noticed, but this little guy ‘Corn’ (Alex Cornejo) is all over the field making plays for us. All 120 pounds of him flying around. Hands down our best corner,” Ryder said. \nAnd Ornduff capitalized quickly, hitting Nfon in stride on a 55-yard scoring play for a 35-21 lead. \nThe Longhorns again marched the ball down the field, but Live Oak made a stand on its own 17 and on fourth down, forced an incompletion for a second turnover on downs. \nAnd Live Oak again made the most of it, as Ornduff found Lomanto for a 12-yard score five plays later. \nIt was set up by Conforti’s 58-yard play that brought the ball from the 17 to the Longhorn 25. \nLeigh did get back on the board thanks to help from a pass interference call. The Longhorns went 82 yards with King finding Grant McGee for a score. \nLeigh hand a chance to make it a one score game late thanks to a Ryder interception being waived off when the officials ruled he had interfered with the receiver. \nThe Longhorns then marched down to the Live Oak 20 where a trio of incompletions ended the drive with a turnover on downs. \nLive Oak will next host Leland 7 p.m. Oct. 9 for homecoming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:59:32.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
