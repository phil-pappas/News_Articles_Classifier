Caracella, plus Kuchar, who had three birdies against five bogeys. \nKuchar, who arrived from South Korea where he had played in the winning United States team at the Presidents Cup, said the gusty conditions at the Natadola Bay resort meant “it was purely about survival out there.” \nFijian-born Vijay Singh was in a tie for 33rd at six over.
