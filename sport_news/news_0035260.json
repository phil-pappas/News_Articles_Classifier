Mounds began its rally on a touchdown drive — capped by a fourth-down pass from the five-yard line. \nAfter getting the ball back, Morrison tallied the tying touchdown — and booted the extra point — with approximately four minutes remaining. \nBarnsdall still had one final opportunity offensively, but their drive sputtered due to a sack and a few incompletions. \n“Our boys played hard,” Warford explained. “We have two fumbles by Mounds that we could have recovered.” \nBoth of those missed turnover opportunities occurred during Mounds’ scoring drives. \n“Sometimes, you just don’t get the breaks,” Warford said. \nPanther quarterback James Cole connected on 7-of-14 passes for 63 yards and one of the Panthers’ touchdowns. \nCole also ran for a touchdown during one of his 14 carries. \nBarnsdall feature runningback Payton McCarty eclipsed the century mark, rumbled for 106 yards — and a touchdown — on 13 totes. \nReceiver Landon Lanphear hauled in just one reception — but it was good for a 21-yard touchdown play. \nMcCarty snared one catch for 25 yards and Paul Schmidt fingered four receptions for 15 yards. \nOn the defensive side, Colten Allen and McCarty each racked up 12 tackles, followed by Cole, nine; Schmidt, nine; and Wesley Yarber, seven. \nIn reality, the Panthers went into that contest with almost one armed tied behind their. Three of their starting defensive backs/receivers sat out, due to injury. \nEven though this trio will be absent again this week, Warford said his defense should match up better against Morrison. \n“Morrison runs a lot of things,” he said. “They have seven or eight, sometimes nine guys on the line. … We definitely are geared toward stopping the run.” \nBarnsdall also gains a new weapon, senior transfer Austin Nelson, who has had to sit out to become eligible to play. Nelson is slated to play in the offensive backfield and at defensive end. \nNelson’s planned debut has been delayed two weeks, due to injuries, Warford said. \n“It will be good to see his first taste of action,” the coach added. \nBarnsdall will focus more this week on its running game, including lining up at times in a full-house backfield, he added. \nHe praised the efforts of Lanphear, Colton Auschwitz and Logan Bryant for stepping into the roles left vacant by the injuries to his secondary players/receivers. \nWith the best mix of talent he can field right now, Warford is hoping the Barnsdall can make a U-turn tonight in their season fortunes and move into the fast lane of success.
