Putnam Dam - in typical governmentese, \"Souhegan Watershed Floodwater Retarding Structure No. 8.\" The resulting pond covers 48 acres, most of the area along Cemetery Road between the South Cemetery and Pinnacle Mountain Fish and Game Club in Lyndeborough. The 300 acres surrounding the pond are the Putnam Conservation Area. The new 24-foot earth dam replaced a quite modest beaver construction and a pretty little pond favored by local horn pouters and pickerel fishermen. The new pond, of course, attracts a lot more fishermen and has been stocked with other kinds of fish. That section of town, one of the few level places in Lyndeborough, has long been known as Lucas Flats. The cellar hole of Luke Lucas' house is near the entrance to the boat launch. There were no members of the Lucas family in town in 1900. Since there is no swimming area, the boat launch is the only amenity on the pond, with access by way of Lucas' driveway. Upgrading the parking area is being considered by the selectmen. They want to remove some dead trees, cut the brush and add some gravel to the driveway. Upgrading the launch area would require permission from the state, which owns the area. (The town Conservation Commission has a 99-year renewable lease). No one has lived on The Flats for more than 100 years, if anyone ever did, but there is history there just the same. Around 1800, bog iron ore was dug from someplace under the pond and fashioned into pots at a forge on Furnace Brook. From probably the 1890s through World War II, the town had a baseball team someplace on The Flats. The exact locations are no longer known. Jim Putnam, for whom the pond is named and who owned the site, was born in 1881. He commented once that as a small boy his grandfather had taken him out in a boat and shown him where the iron was dug, but he didn't remember where that spot was - but judging by the former pond it was somewhere near the middle of the present one. The iron furnace was established by two brothers, James and Henry Cram, who lived where I do now. The furnace was on Furnace Brook \"just above the present bridge,\" according to the 1905 history. That area would be near the northern end of the cemetery, but whether the bridge mentioned is the one built around 1890 when the road was relocated or an earlier one isn't specified. There is no longer any sign of it. The history mentions foundation stones, which I have never located. In addition to the kettles and griddles, the Crams made some of the first cut nails in the area. The old ballfield probably isn't under the pond. A former road agent said, when he was taking sand and gravel off The Flats in the 1950s, that he saw evidence of what may have been the field. It was in the area now occupied by the rifle range at the Fish and Game Club. The town history (1905-55) mentions ballgames at Old Home Days through 1936. The conservation area and pond are popular with canoers and kayakers, birdwatchers, great blue herons, several families of Canada geese, some beavers, river otters, deer and moose. There is also a constant display of wildflowers. It's a great place for a stroll with the dog. Keep up with the past with Another Perspective, which runs monthly in The Telegraph.
