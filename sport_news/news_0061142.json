By Cam Inman Posted: 10/10/2015 10:37:18 AM PDT Updated: 10/10/2015 02:01:29 PM PDT EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- All along, Colin Kaepernick and NaVorro Bowman figured to be the 49ers' lead actors in this dramatic season, for better or worse. \nWould Kaepernick take charge of an offense missing Frank Gore? Would Bowman play like an All-Pro linebacker in his long-awaited comeback? Would the 49ers actually rally behind those captains -- and will they now with 12 games to go? \nThose questions remain unanswered as the discombobulated 49ers (1-3) take a three-game losing streak into Sunday night's visit to the New York Giants (2-2). Reversing course, and doing so in the NFL's biggest spotlight, is the 49ers' unquestioned goal.

Meyer/Bay Area News Group) \n\"When you play in New York, you want to make sure you have one of your best games,\" Bowman said. \"If you have a goal to be famous or to be talked about throughout this league, New York is the place you can do that. You can earn your stripes. \n\"Being that our team is so young, if I relay that message to them, they'll understand where I'm coming from.\" \nBreakdowns on offense, defense and even special teams have the 49ers free-falling from contention. This isn't the same bunch that fought the Giants to an overtime loss four seasons ago in the NFC championship game. \nKaepernick, especially, hasn't looked the same as in recent years. He's been soundly panned after back-to-back, dismal outings. Advertisement \n\"I'm taking the Giants for one reason and one reason only: Colin Kaepernick is a mess. They've ruined that kid,\" former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason said Friday on his New York-based, morning-radio show. \nKaepernick completed just 50 percent of his passes with five interceptions and no touchdowns in the past two defeats. \nOffensive coordinator Geep Chryst found one way to spark hope of a Kaepernick revival, by reflecting on his prime-time history. \n\"Traditionally, Kap has played well in the spotlight,\" Chryst said. \"Not perfect, but on the Monday night, I think his record's 5-0, including his first start against the Bears.\" \nThat's true. So is this: the 49ers are 2-4 in Kaepernick's Sunday night starts. \nHis faults aside, other factors aren't helping. A patchwork line is on pace to allow a franchise-high 56 sacks. The 49ers' average starting field position is the league's worst (18.7-yard line). And the 49ers defense has only two interceptions and no fumble recoveries, enhancing the field-position plight. \nWhether behind Kaepernick or Alex Smith, the 49ers contended the past four seasons with much more than an efficient quarterback. They've long relied on a power running game, which is now more zone oriented and has been mostly stashed since Week 1 while they fight scoreboard deficits. \nHard-hitting, intimidating defense used to be the 49ers' recipe for success. That reputation got ruined with embarrassing routs at Pittsburgh (43-18) and Arizona (47-7). However, the 49ers did take an encouraging step last week, in a losing effort to the Green Bay Packers (17-3). \nBowman has been there almost every step of the way with his reconstructed left knee. He played all 73 snaps against the Packers (a season-high for him) and 249-of-257 snaps through four games. \n\"He's fighting his way back from a very serious injury,\" Giants coach Tom Couglin said. \"He certainly is an admirable competitor, because he's on the field the entire ballgame and does a great job with it.\" \nJim Tomsula said Friday the 49ers are monitoring Bowman's snap count, noting: \"We want to stay ahead of that, obviously, but looks like he's doing fine\" \nEarlier in the week, the 49ers acquired Minnesota Vikings linebacker Gerald Hodges for what Tomsula described as \"depth\" purposes. It's unknown whether Hodges will spell Bowman, or fellow starter Michael Wilhoite, against the Giants. \nBowman collected a season-high 12 tackles last game, his first double-digit mark since the Jan. 19, 2014 loss at Seattle, where he suffered the career-threatening knee injury in the NFC championship game. In three career meetings with the Giants, his tackle totals are 17, 13, 14. \n\"He looks to be moving around well, making plays, doing a good job and getting around the ball a bunch,\" Giants quarterback Eli Manning said. \nBowman said he isn't back to his All-Pro form. He's missed some tackles, lapsed in coverage and failed to create turnovers -- all of which can be said for every defensive teammate. \n\"It's definitely getting better,\" Bowman said. \"It's allowing me to get more comfortable with it. These are the things I knew would come, and I just expect it to keep getting better.\" \nAfter each of the past three losses, Bowman has lamented the 49ers expected growing pains and noted a young supporting cast. Before each game, Bowman has assumed Patrick Willis' former role of breaking down the team huddle with shouts of encouragement. \nPerhaps that's when he'll remind the 49ers this game is about their stage, and perhaps he'll quote Sinatra: \"If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere.\" \nAndrew Tiller, who practiced as the first-team left guard in June's minicamp, was promoted Saturday from the practice squad. Tiller figures to be active Sunday night as a reserve, and he will wear No. 61. \nCornerback Shareece Wright was released in a corresponding roster move. Wright was inactive all four games this season. For more on the 49ers, see Cam Inman's Hot Read blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers .
