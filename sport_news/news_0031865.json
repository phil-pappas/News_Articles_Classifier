Vettel is a distant second to Hamilton in the driver standings and needs to finish within nine points of the Mercedes driver to push the title chase beyond this weekend. Ferrari has already used its allowed four engines this season. Using a fifth incurs the penalty. Vettel seemed fine with sacrificing his slim title hopes this season if its means better car performance over the final few races with an eye toward 2016. His Ferrari teammate, Kimi Raikkonen, also will get a new engine and a starting grid penalty. College Basketball Pitino denies involvement in escort allegations LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Louisville head coach Rick Pitino vowed to Cardinals fans that he “will not resign and let you down” as investigations continue into an escort’s book allegations that one of his former staffers hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players. In a season preview Thursday on his website, the Hall of Fame coach apologized to fans for having to “endure the pain” of allegations by Katina Powell that Andre McGee paid strippers to perform 22 shows from 2010-14 at the players’ dormitory. Pitino, 63, has denied knowledge of the activities described in Powell’s book and said Thursday, “someday I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years but that time is not now. I do not fight these accusations by others but rather turn the other cheek.” MLB Donnie Baseball no longer in Los Angeles baseball LOS ANGELES – Don Mattingly is out as manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He and the team mutually agreed to part ways, a person with knowledge of the situation said Thursday. The person spoke to The Associated Press on on condition of anonymity because the team had not announced Mattingly’s departure. Front office officials were expected to speak at a news conference later in the day. Los Angeles was 446-363 under Mattingly, finishing with a winning record in every season and winning the last three NL West titles. But the Dodgers have not reached the World Series since winning the championship in 1988. The 54-year-old former Yankees star ranks sixth in wins among Dodgers managers. Cubs failed bid to end curse draws TV ratings NEW YORK – The NL Championship Series had its largest television audience since 2010 despite lasting four games. The New York Mets’ sweep of the Chicago Cubs in a matchup of big-market teams averaged 7.9 million viewers on TBS. The network said Thursday that was the most since the six-game Giants-Phillies series five years ago on Fox. The audience was up 55 percent from last year. NBA Throne rubbing King James’ back the wrong way INDEPENDENCE, Ohio – LeBron James didn’t take part in all of Cleveland’s practice as he remains limited by his back. Cavs head coach David Blatt said the team is being “conscientious and cautious” with James, who received an anti-inflammatory injection last week. James didn’t speak to the media following the Cavs’ workout at Cleveland Clinic Courts. Blatt said James is “fine” heading into the season opener on Tuesday in Chicago. The four-time MVP only played in two of Cleveland’s seven exhibition games, missing the last three after receiving a shot.
