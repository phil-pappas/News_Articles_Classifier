(Photo: Paul Sancya, Associated Press) \nIf there was any doubt Chris Webber has had enough about his relationship with former Michigan teammmate Jalen Rose, it was sufficiently removed Thursday.\nWebber, the former Fab Five member, was interviewed Thursday on The Doug Gottlieb Show on CBS Sports Radio, seemingly to tout his new gig at Wake Forest, where he will teach a “sports storytelling” master’s program starting next fall.\nAnd, he did. Then, toward the end of the interview, Gottlieb asked Webber about Rose.\nThere’s been an apparent rift between Webber and his former Fab Five teammates, something that played out around the 2011 release of Rose’s ESPN “30 for 30” documentary on the group that arrived on campus in 1991 and helped the Wolverines reach the NCAA title game in 1992 and 1993.\nFour years after the documentary aired, Webber and Rose had a public back-and-forth about why Webber didn’t participate in the documentary.\nGottlieb asked Webber about his relationship with Rose on Thursday.\n“What did you just ask me?” Webber asked.\nGottlieb asked again.\n“Wherever it was,” Webber said.\nAnd, that’s all Webber wanted to say. But, he didn’t.\n“I mean, Doug, we ain’t talking about that,” said Webber the former Detroit Country Day and NBA star. “You ain’t getting that interview. I’m talking about Wake Forest. I don’t talk about him. I talked about him one time on The Dan Patrick Show. That was it.”\nGottlieb tried to explain himself, but Webber wasn’t having it.\n“Come on, Doug,” Webber said. “I just told you respectfully on your show I’m not going to talk about it. I’m talking about being a professor at Wake Forest teaching a class on culture in sports. Now do want to beat me up because I did not answer you on your show?”\nAnd, so it went: Gottlieb trying to explain why he asked the question, and Webber saying he didn’t want to answer it. The interview wrapped up with Webber taking a final shot at Gottlieb’s interview.\n“I hope the students sign up (for his class at Wake Forest) because the class is going to be way more fun than this interview,” Webber said. “It’s going to be crazy. Thank you.”\nVisit here to listen to the interview in its entirety.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:11:03.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
