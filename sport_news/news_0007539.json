The Eagles (2-5, 1-3 in Region 3 ) couldn’t recover from three interceptions, two lost fumbles and a special teams gaffe.“We cut down tremendously on our penalties, but it was the turnovers that hurt us,” South Cobb coach Sherrod Rainge said, “ and the dropped passes.”South Cobb’s first fumble on its second series of the game proved costly, and a loose ball ended up making its way into the end zone where the Panthers recovered for a 7-0 lead. The Eagles lost their second fumble when they were two yards away from scoring and Langston Hughes recovered on its own 1-yard line.Langston Hughes also took advantage of a botched punt deep in South Cobb territory and recovered at the 6 before scoring, and the Panthers scored again right before the break to take a 21-0 lead. South Cobb did find success running the ball against the Cougars. The Eagles got on the board on a Tyreik Fitzpatrick nine-yard run and got back into the game when Jordan Robinson blocked a punt and Ahmad Johnson recovered it in the end zone to get within two scores at 28-14.“We ran the ball better than we have any time this year, so that was encouraging,” Rainge said. South Cobb looks to snap a two-game losing streak at Campbell on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:42:23.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
