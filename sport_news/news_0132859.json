However, the weather is a lot better and it can be an interesting time to shop for a mix of 2015 and 2016 models in the showrooms. It’s also a good time to make sure you’ve got a reliable vehicle with winter somewhere on the horizon.\nOn the subject of showrooms, you’ve no doubt noticed that the neighborhood dealerships are rapidly disappearing, morphing into glitzy new buildings in high-traffic areas.\nRelated Links 2016 Smart ForTwo solves many problems, not all 2016 Range Rover Sport offers plenty of luxury to love Nissan’s 2016 370Z roadster: A ragtop rambler It can be fun to check out the buildings—and the vehicles—if you’re in the market to buy. We’re beginning to look for a new Snowbird Sleigh for Florida trips.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Here’s a potpourri of vehicles we might be visiting over the weekend.\nAcura RDX: The luxury compact crossover recently achieved a Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) when equipped with AcuraWatch. That’s the high-tech package that includes collision-mitigation braking, forward collision warning, and lane-keeping assist technology. While at the Acura store, it’s worth checking out the 2016 TLX mid-sized sedan that is just hitting the showrooms.\nFiat 500X: It wasn’t because the Pope chose a Fiat, nor was it Fiat’s clever “little blue pill” ad. We drove the 500X two weeks ago and loved the way it handled and its interior space. Maybe a subcompact SUV would fit our needs after all.\nFord Edge: A bowling buddy recently asked if a new Edge in the parking lot belonged to me. It didn’t, but I wish it did. Ford’s done a nice job upgrading its popular crossover, something that has recently been acknowledged in its latest ratings.\nHonda HR-V: We knew this would be a popular vehicle the first time we drove it. Now visitors to the Honda stores are going to have a tough choice between this and its slightly bigger sibling, the CR-V. I’ve never been a big SUV fan, but these days you almost need the higher driving position to safely navigate our highways. Besides, these crossovers—dare we say it?—are today’s station wagons.\nChevrolet Camaro: We could have put the Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger in this spot, but Mrs. G signed up to help drive a new Camaro from Detroit to Syracuse as part of Chevrolet’s Find New Roads promotion. We’ll take an early look at what we may be driving—and maybe plan a belated honeymoon stop at Niagara Falls en route.\nNissan Titan : If ever a name described the original bigger than full-sized vehicle, Titan is it. Toyota and Nissan have hung in the full-sized pickup market, fighting for market share against the Detroit 3. It’s a daunting task. We want to see how Nissan will fare with what it’s calling the “American Titan.”\nVolvo XC90: If nothing else, you have to sit in the driver’s seat and play with the huge laptop-sized touchscreen. It’s stunning to see your satellite radio presets, with each one showing the artist and song that’s playing. If that distracts you, Volvo’s CitySafety driver assistance package is state-of-the-art.\nTesla Model X: Tesla says it will be the fastest and safest sport utility in history with AWD and 250 miles of range, plus seating for seven adults. 0-to-60 time is under 4 seconds. You could be the first kid on your block to have one, except delivery time is estimated to be a year from now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:26:39.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
