(AP) - It has been over a year since Stevan Ridley last cradled a football in a game. It’s also the last time he openly wept on the sideline. \nOn Oct. 12, 2014, the then-New England running back took a handoff from Tom Brady late in the third quarter at Buffalo, made an awkward step while trying to avoid a tackle and went down in a heap. \nHe had two torn ligaments in his right knee, the same one he hurt in college. Ridley’s season was over and his career in jeopardy. But after allowing his emotions to pour out, he never doubted he would someday be back on the field. \n“My faith is in a God that can work miracles, some beautiful things,” said Ridley, now a member of the New York Jets. “I’ve seen way bigger issues come around than a knee injury. I’ve seen people be cured from cancer.” \nSo, for more than 12 months, Ridley has been working hard and praying for his comeback. \nHe fully practiced for the first time Wednesday since the injury, and has a chance to make his season debut Sunday against the Patriots in New England. \n“The story couldn’t be written any better,” Ridley said. “I’m fired up about it. It’s my distant family. I’ve got so many friends that are over there. Just to say that I went out a year ago and I’m coming back this week against my old team, it’s kind of crazy. I don’t think you could make a movie any better than that.” \nCoach Todd Bowles and offensive coordinator Chan Gailey want to see how Ridley comes through the week before making a decision whether to activate him from the physically unable to perform list. \nRidley would be a welcome addition as an experienced playmaker behind Chris Ivory, although he insisted he’s no “magic piece” to the offense. \n“He looks OK,” Gailey said. “You don’t see the same burst that you saw, but you shouldn’t. That’s got to come, and I think it will come. You can see flashes that he has good feet and he has good balance and good vision, but just that little burst isn’t quite there yet.” \nRegardless, just getting back on the field is significant progress for Ridley. \nWhile he was still rehabbing from the injury, Ridley became a free agent and was not re-signed by the Patriots, with whom he rushed for 2,817 yards and 22 touchdowns in four seasons. The Jets brought him in, having seen enough of him against them to know he could be valuable once he got healthy. \nAnd, talk about timing. \n“That’s an obvious question, man,” Ridley said, when asked if the opponent provides a little extra spark. “I’m motivated, of course, because I’m a competitor. I’m motivated because I’m going against my old team. I’m motivated because this is my first game back.” \nThe Patriots and Tom Brady haven’t missed a beat this season without Ridley or Shane Vereen, who was also allowed to become a free agent and joined the Giants. New England boasts the No. 2 overall offense and the undefeated Patriots (5-0) have LeGarrette Blount (249 yards rushing, four TDs) and Dion Lewis (201, 2) powering the running game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:38:13.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
