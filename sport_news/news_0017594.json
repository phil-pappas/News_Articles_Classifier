After Sandusky was charged, the interview subjects met with a legal team led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh that was working for Penn State. \nLeete said Kenney and the Paternos can file those notes under seal, so the judge can examine whether their status is covered by previous court orders. \nThe county court also publicly released a motion filed Friday by the two sides about the case schedule. It sets out a series of deadlines between now and August. If the case remains active by then, they wrote, the judge can schedule briefs about whether the case should be moved from the State College area and address when trial will take place. \nJoe Paterno's estate is suing the NCAA and two officials for commercial disparagement, saying a since-abolished consent decree with Penn State made false and defamatory statements. \nJay Paterno and Kenney, now an assistant at Western Michigan University, argue that they have been prevented from finding comparable jobs and were victims of a civil conspiracy. \nPenn State was dropped as a defendant in the case in July. \nSandusky, who spent decades as the Nittany Lions' top defensive coach under Joe Paterno, was convicted of 45 counts of child sex abuse in 2012 and is serving a 30- to 60-year prison sentence. \nA hearing on Sandusky's request that he be allowed to obtain new information for his Post-Conviction Relief Act appeal is scheduled for this month in Bellefonte.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:46:02.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
