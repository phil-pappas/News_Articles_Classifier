That'd be Chenango Valley, back in 2011. \nSince that title four years ago, CV has exactly a .500 record at 19-19. The Warriors haven't made the playoffs the past two seasons. However, the Warriors' 22-12 win over Waverly improved CV's record to 4-1 and left the Warriors in control of their own fate to earn the top seed in Class B. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nThe Warriors say getting through the rough patches in 2013 and 2014 has paved the way for success this year. \n\"We've had a lot of rough years and it's been a tough ride, but I think we've just always been hanging in there,\" said senior running back/safety Nick Pert, whose two fourth quarter interceptions helped ice the win over Waverly. \n\"We've been working on the fundamentals every single week. I think we've earned some respect this week but I know we respect our teammates and we've got a good road ahead. I think we definitely put in the work and it's been a tough road.\" \n\"We just don't let the kids get down on themselves,\" said head coach Jay Hope. \"We always tell the kids just think about what's next. You can't turn the page back, you can only turn it forward and we feel like they're buying into that philosophy and it shows on the field.\" \nChenango Valley can clinch a playoff berth in Class B with a win at Oneonta (0-5) in Week 6.
