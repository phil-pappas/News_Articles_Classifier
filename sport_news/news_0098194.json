Did interim Rutgers coach Norries Wilson take one for the program?\nSounds like it. Wilson accepted blame for the fourth-down spike that prevented RU trying a Hail Mary pass against Michigan State, but a prominent offensive player said afterward that offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels made the call.\n2. How impressive was Leonte Carroo’s return from his suspension?\nCarroo’s three touchdowns in his first game in nearly a month was enough to prompt Michigan State grad Plaxico Burress, the former Giants and Jets receiver who was on the Spartans’ sideline, to call it one of the best performances he’s seen.\n3. Why was last Saturday such a memorable day for the Big Ten Network?\nBecause the network generated its highest viewership ever. The Maryland-Ohio State game at noon averaged a 2.6 rating; the 3:30 pm Northwestern-Michigan had a 2.3 rating, and the 8 o’clock Michigan State-Rutgers game generated a 1.7.\n4. What is it costing Maryland to dump head coach Randy Edsall in midseason?\nEdsall has a $3.1 million buyout. While the president of Maryland keeps bringing up Chip Kelly as a possible replacement, the Terps probably will be in the market for a mid-level coach such as Temple’s Matt Rhule.\n5. Who are the leading candidates to succeed Steve Spurrier at South Carolina?\nIt’s a bit early to speculate because there will be more openings at the end of the season, but former Texas coach Mack Brown, who’s doing TV work after retiring, has said he would be willing to listen if South Carolina came calling.\n6. Why is Penn State looking to renovate Beaver Stadium or build a new stadium?\nFinances. Penn State’s athletic department reported a slight profit in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, up from a $6 million loss in 2013, according to a financial report submitted to the NCAA. A better or new stadium would be a more versatile venue.\n7. Who was the last Big Ten quarterback to be selected in the NFL Draft’s first round?\nKerry Collins of Penn State, by Carolina in 1995. That drought should end next spring. Barring injury, Michigan State’s Connor Cook looks like a mid-first round pick. Maybe even one of the Ohio State QBs gets picked.\n8. How far-reaching is head coach Brian Kelly’s influence on Notre Dame’s program?\nApparently very far-reaching. Kelly reportedly thought Mike Mayock, the analyst on NBC’s coverage of the Irish, was too critical of his team. It’s no coincidence that Doug Flutie has replaced Mayock this season.\n9. Why didn’t Stanford super sophomore Christian McCaffrey play more as a freshman?\nMcCaffrey, son of former Giants receiver Ed McCaffrey, only averaged 4 1/2 touches per game last season because Cardinal coach David Shaw demands that all his running backs be good pass protectors.\n10. Why are so many high-profile programs looking to upgrade their nonconference schedules?\nBecause their conferences are urging them to so they can meet the demands of the new playoff system. Kansas State, which notoriously plays weak non-Big 12 schedules, has booked a home-and-home series with Stanford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:33:39.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
