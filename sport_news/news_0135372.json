Bids would be due on Nov. 2, and a court hearing to consider the auction results would take place Nov. 24, according to the schedule Haggen has proposed. The company has asked the bankruptcy court for a hearing on Oct. 19 to consider that schedule. Haggen, which earlier this year bought 146 grocery stores, including the former Albertsons store in Baker City, announced last month that it plans to close 100 of those stores. The Baker City store is slated to close Nov. 25. The Baker City store employs about 50 people. Haggen took over the store from Albertsons in mid-May. Grocery analysis Burt P. Flickinger last month described Haggen’s bankruptcy as “the fastest (failure) in modern supermarket history. In all of retail, I haven’t seen anything like this.” In a press release this morning, Haggen said the auction process it has proposed “has been designed to be fair and transparent in order to derive the highest bid for the stores and to maximize value for the estate and creditors in an orderly process. The procedures will allow the sale auction(s) to be conducted in a controlled, fair and open fashion that will encourage participation of financially capable buyers.” In addition to requesting court hearings for the proposed auction schedule, Haggen has filed motions with the bankruptcy court in Delaware to approve the sales of eight stores in California to Gelson’s Markets, and 28 stores in California and Nevada to Smart & Final LLC.
