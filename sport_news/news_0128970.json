But that doesn't necessarily mean Carroo will resume his typical heavy workload on Saturday when the Scarlet Knights host Michigan State (8 p.m., BTN).\nCarroo is scheduled to participate in practice on Thursday morning. It will be the first team activity Carroo has participated in since Rutgers lost to Washington State, 37-34, on Sept. 12 .\nCoach Kyle Flood suspended Carroo indefinitely on Sept. 13 after the receiver was arrested and charged with simple assault for his role in an altercation that took place outside the team's headquarters after the Washington State game. Carroo's reinstatement on Wednesday afternoon came one day after the assault charge was dismissed.\nCarroo missed two games during the suspension that spanned 25 days. He was not able to workout at the Hale Center or attend team meetings during his suspension.\nCarroo was at the team's facility on Wednesday, but Thursday's practice will be the first opportunity for the coaching staff to see the program's career leader in touchdown catches back on the field.\n\"We'll get a gauge of where his conditioning is and things he did while he was away to keep himself in shape and then just his overall retention of things we do offensively,\" interim coach Norries Wilson said Wednesday night while filling in for the suspended Flood on his weekly radio show. \"(Wide receivers coach Anthony) Campanile will do a good job getting him up to speed on what we're doing in the game plan this week. We'll just make an honest assessment of where we think he can fit in, if at all, for this weekend.\"\nRELATED: Teammates welcome back Leonte Carroo\nRutgers will hold two practices before Saturday, which doesn't leave Carroo much time to get back into game shape.\n\"I think it's going to depend on how much you expect that player to do in the game,\" Wilson said. \"If you had just a small package for him to go out and run four, five, six plays and be able to give him a break and the other players that have been around can go out and play also ... it's going to take some time to get into game shape. There's a big difference from practice shape and game shape. You move a little faster, everyone is playing a little bit faster in the game than they do in practice, as much as you emphasize going full speed (in practice). I'm sure there's going to have to be some readjusting for him, but I think he should readjust fine.\"\nThe game plan for Michigan State is fully installed and the other wide receivers have been preparing accordingly during practice. But as a senior captain, it shouldn't take Carroo long to get up to speed with the game plan.\n\"He'll get more prep time and film time and he'll get some meeting time with his coach,\" Wilson said. \"I think he should be fine. He's a bright player, he's played a lot of football, he understands the game and how to attack the defense. We'll just take it one day at a time.\"\nHere are five stories to get you up to speed on the latest Rutgers football news:\n• Suspended receiver Leonte Carroo reinstated by coach Kyle Flood\n• Can Leonte Carroo's return turn around Rutgers' season? | Politi Bits\n• Rutgers' secondary will be tested by Michigan State | Practice Report\n• Rutgers teammates welcome back reinstated receiver Leonte Carroo\n• Can Rutgers give Michigan State a scare?
