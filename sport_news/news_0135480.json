In fact there are at least seven teams in the Championship who have better squads that Sunderland. Their signings over the summer were just awful, and the optimism from their fans was actually quite sad – I just knew they were going to be bad. \nTransfer policies are a very hot topic at the moment after the recent sackings of Brendan Rodgers and Sunderland’s own Dick Advocaat, neither of which had control over who was bought into their side. \nIf Sunderland are to get their club back in order, they HAVE to change their transfer policy and invest some money, as well as allowing their own manager to make the signings. They need signings in January, and here are five I think they should look at. \nNick Blackman – Reading \nThe Royals striker has had an outstanding start to the Football League season and is currently the joint top scorer in the second tier. He’s forced his way into becoming a key member of their side. \nHe does have Premier League experience, but not much. For this signing to really come off, Big Sam would have to analyse the role he plays up front for Reading, as Steve Clarke seems to have finally hit on something to get the best out of him, whereas in other roles he’s been very poor in recent years. \nThe reason I’ve chosen Blackman over the likes of, say, Charlie Austin and Jordan Rhodes, is that he would be available for dirt cheap in January, with his contract up in the summer. Unless Reading tie him up to a new deal, this is a move that Sunderland should consider. \nBryan Oviedo – Everton \nAnother one who’s contract is up next summer, Oviedo just can’t seem to get a look in at Everton. Even when Leighton Baines is injured, the Costa Rican is still behind Brendan Galloway in the pecking order. \nA player who seems like a makes a decent Premier League player, Oviedo is that something solid that Sunderland need. Patrick Van Aanholt’s blunders at the back this season have left fans frustrated, and if they were to buy a defender over January, it would probably be a left back. \nConsidering he’s only a rotation player for the Blues, he wouldn’t be available for much and would seem a solid signing for Sunderland. \nKevin Wimmer – Tottenham Hotspur \nBefore I’m completely shot down, I mean this as a loan deal. Now, of course I don't know whether or not Kevin Wimmer would actually be available on loan, but it’s definitely something to think about. \nThe Austrian has impressed in his only start at Tottenham this season in the Europa League, and was very solid in the Bundesliga at Cologne. There’s definitely a good player there, who may start growing frustrated over his lack of game time. \nI personally think signing Younes Kaboul and Sebastian Coates was a terrible idea from Sunderland. It spelt out a typical Black Cats signing – sub par and on the cheap. They need another, solid centre back at the back to help them clamber out of this mess. \nSam Byram – Leeds United \nThe one player I saw Sunderland linked with over the summer whom I thought ‘That’s a good idea’. Byram is continuing to impress Leeds fans and Premier League sides alike, and is currently in a contract spat with the club, as he refuses a new deal. \nI don’t think Billy Jones is a Premier League quality player, neither do I think DeAndre Yedlin is ready for Premier League football – after being targeted by Bolton and Derby during the summer. \nIf he does end up not signing on, Sunderland really have to pounce on this. The 21-year-old is a good, good player and is showing signs of real promise. It would be idiotic not to. \nMatt Phillips – Queens Park Rangers \nThe Scotland international was one of few that impressed for QPR during their season long stay in the Premier League, and after his reintroduction back in the squad from Chris Ramsey, he ended up with one of the highest assists rates of any player from the top five leagues in Europe. \nI was fairly surprised he didn’t leave over the summer, despite interest from West Brom and Southampton, but Phillips is a player with flair, a vicious strike and the ability to create goals \nSunderland’s options out wide are looking a little dull at the moment, Jeremain Lens the only creditable option, apart from Adam Johnson who has been less than impressive this season.
