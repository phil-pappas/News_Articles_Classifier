On a blustery afternoon, South Medford played with the wind in the first half and Kyle Owings capitalized with a hat trick to give the Panthers (6-1-4, 4-0-3 SWC) a 3-0 lead at intermission. Sheldon (5-1-4, 4-1-2) finally got cranked up with a goal in the 72nd minute, then followed with scores in the 77th and 79th. “The first one was legitimate,” said Panthers coach Josh Desmond. “It was a nicely struck ball. The next two, there was some frustration; panic mode settled in. We’ve had a few games where we let the other team tie us late like that. I think the boys were just having flashbacks.” South Medford, which is tied for first place with South Eugene, gave up three goals in the final eight minutes of a one-point loss to West Salem and was tied in the last couple minutes by North Medford and South Eugene. Against Sheldon, said Desmond, “We didn’t quit. We had a couple chances at the end to take the lead and just didn’t capitalize.” The high-scoring Owings tallied in the 15th and 28th minutes on passes from Jon Pellegrina, then scored again in the 38th with an assist from John Henry Gaffney. WILLAMETTE 4, NORTH MEDFORD 1 : At Eugene, North Medford senior Manny Mejia scored off a nice pass from sophomore Angel Zamores in the 15th minute but Willamette tallied four unanswered goals to claim the SWC win. The Black Tornado (3-5-3, 3-2-2) saw its lead overtaken in the ensuing 10 minutes with a pair of goals by the Wolverines (7-2-2, 4-1-2). SOUTH EUGENE 2, GRANTS PASS 0 : At Eugene, South Eugene moved into a first-place tie with South Medford in the SWC with the shutout victory. The Axemen improved to 6-2-3 overall and 4-0-3 in SWC play, while Grants Pass dropped to 2-9 and 1-6. EAGLE POINT 2, MARIST 1, OT : At Eagle Point, Eagle Point senior Kevin Van Dyke stole the ball, beat a couple defenders and fired a 17-yard shot into the net for the go-ahead goal in overtime at Eagle Stadium. Van Dyke scored in the 93rd minute for the Eagles (6-3, 1-1 MWL), who held Marist scoreless in the two 10-minute overtime periods. Sebastian Tovar scored on a free kick from 25 yards out in the 34th minute for EP, but Lucas Holt’s goal in the 65th tied it for Marist (4-4-2, 1-1). CASCADE CHRISTIAN 7, ROGUE RIVER 1 : At Rogue River, Cascade Christian senior Travis Cave scored four goals and freshman Ethan Hoffman had two goals and two assists in the District 5 victory. Jesse Fretz added three assists for the Challengers (7-2, 7-1 Dist. 5), who also received one goal and one assist by Kallen Rechberg and one assist by Ben McDonald. Gavin Decker scored on a quality long shot in the first half for Rogue River (2-8, 1-8). ST.MARY’S 16, ILLINOIS VALLEY 0 : St. Mary’s blew out visiting Illinois Valley in the District 5 game, getting five second-half goals from Luka Cvijanovic. The Crusaders (10-2, 9-0 Dist. 5) got four goals each from Hunter Rothfus, all in the first half, and Alec Robertson, who scored two in each half. Other scores were by Justin Hawkins, Austin Pena and Jeremy Wu. Illinois Valley is 1-8 and 0-8.
