The 2014 World Cup finalists now have just one point after two matches.\n\nThey lost their opening qualifying match 0-2 against Ecuador.\nArgentina's attack was toothless without captain Messi as well as injured forward Sergio Aguero.\nTheir replacements Angel Di Maria and Carlos Tevez were wasteful, blowing easy chances.\nTevez headed over the bar in the 21st minute. Shortly afterwards, Di Maria shot wide from a goal-scoring position, summing up Argentina's performance.\n\"I am not satisfied with the point,\" Argentina coach Tata Martino said after the match on Tuesday.\n\"I am happy with the effort that the players put in. I am unhappy because we needed to win the match.\"\nArgentina face Brazil in their next qualifying match in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:58:38.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
