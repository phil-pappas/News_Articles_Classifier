After opening the season with a 302-yard performance against Texas State, Golson has passed for 484 yards in the next three games combined. He is averaging 196.5 yards for the season, as compared to 265 yards last season at Notre Dame, where he passed for 3,445 yards and 29 touchdowns.\nSeminoles coach Jimbo Fisher said he felt Golson \"took a lot of steps forward\" in last week's 24-16 win over Wake Forest.\nMore coverage Latest SHOP: \"He's shown his maturity and just growing into what's there, making sure his team is in positions to win games,\" Fisher told the Chicago Tribune. \"[He is] taking advantage of opportunities in the red zone . . . third down has been pretty decent in protecting the football.\"\nWe don't know what Golson thinks; he has not been made available to reporters since August. But a national television audience will see him Saturday night against Miami.\nUtes' steady climb So how much do the voters in the Associated Press poll love Utah? The Utes rose five spots in this week's rankings to No. 5 despite not even having played a game last week. Of course, the way they dominated in a 62-20 victory over Oregon, which usually is close to unbeatable at home, still is burned in the memories of the voters and the public.\nBut with Utah's lofty place comes pressure, and it's sure to be there when the Utes meet undefeated California in Salt Lake City.\n\"It's all about remaining humble and working hard and knowing that the hay's not in the barn,\" wide receiver Kenneth Scott told the Salt Lake Tribune.\nWorking on the chain gang People don't usually pay any attention to the chain gang - the folks who hold the first-down sticks, mark the line of scrimmage, and keep track of the downs - until they mess up. The crew deprived Illinois of a down last week, with the Illini having to turn the ball over after third down to Nebraska. In another game, Oklahoma State was incorrectly awarded a first down after a marker was misplaced, and that led to a touchdown during its 36-34 win over Kansas State.\nThe Big Ten and the Big 12 have acknowledged the errors. Illinois won its game, but coach Bill Cubit thinks the increasing speed of the game could be a factor in the mistakes.\nLeonard's our guy Leonard Fournette last week became the first player in the 72-year history of the Southeastern Conference to rush for more than 200 yards in three consecutive games, making you feel as if you're watching a once-in-a-lifetime talent.\nBut the 6-foot-1, 230-pound sophomore from Louisiana State lavishes praise on his linemen like whipped cream on a sundae.\n\"Without my line or my fullback, I'm nothing,\" Fournette said in an Associated Press story. \"I can't block those 11 guys by myself and run the ball. They're doing a tremendous job, and I thank them every day.\"\nSaid center Ethan Pocic: \"It's fun to block for him. It makes you want to block harder.\"\nThe Tide is calm The fervent fans of Alabama could breathe again last week after the Crimson Tide romped to a 38-10 victory at Georgia to climb back into the playoff picture. The Bulldogs' Nick Chubb scored his team's only touchdown late on an 83-yard run, but Alabama held him to 63 yards on his other 19 carries.\nThe Tide have another test this week against Arkansas and Alex Collins, who has rushed for 656 yards and is on a run of three straight 150-yard games. Alabama ranks 10th in the nation in both rushing defense (84.0 yards) and total defense (273.4).\nTriple nightmare For all the focus on defense in Saturday's Big Ten showdown between Northwestern and Michigan, the X-factor might belong to the Wildcats, who have lost to the Wolverines the last three years in different and strange fashion. The 2012 and 2013 Michigan victories came in overtime after game-tying field goals with two seconds left in regulation and at the gun, respectively. Last year, Northwestern scored its only touchdown with three seconds remaining to get to within a point, but went for two and the win and failed in a 10-9 loss.\n\"It's all like one bad memory,\" guard Shane Mertz told ESPN.com. \"It's like a nightmare.\"\nExpatriate of the week Junior left guard Connor Mahoney, who starred at Malvern Prep, has started three games this season for No. 13 Northwestern, which will be tested Saturday at No. 18 Michigan. The 6-foot-4, 290-pound Mahoney is part of an offensive line that has led Justin Jackson to four 100-yard games this season for the 5-0 Wildcats. Northwestern's ranking is its highest since 2000.\nStar watch: Jared Goff, QB, California vs. Utah\nGoff, a 6-foot-4, 215-pound junior who attended the 2012 Elite 11 camp with Penn State's Christian Hackenberg, has put up impressive numbers this season. He has completed 70.2 percent of his passes for 1,630 yards and 15 touchdowns. He is tied for third in the Football Bowl Subdivision in TD passes, seventh in passing efficiency, and seventh in passing yards.\nSaturday's Best Games\nNorthwestern at Michigan, 3:30 p.m., Big Ten Network\nDefense, anyone? In five games, the Wildcats have given up 35 points while the Wolverines have allowed 38, making the two teams 1-2 in the nation. Northwestern is plus-6 in turnovers; Michigan quarterback Jake Rudock has thrown six interceptions.\nSouth Carolina at Louisiana State, 3:30 p.m., ESPN\nThis game was moved from Columbia, S.C., to Baton Rouge, La., because of this week's flooding. It gives the Tigers' Leonard Fournette a good chance to run for 200 yards for a fourth straight week. The Gamecocks have not stopped the run well.\nMiami at Florida State, 8 p.m., 6ABC\nThe Seminoles have won five straight over their in-state rival, and are putting a 26-game winning streak in ACC games on the line. The Hurricanes have struggled defensively but possess talent on offense in quarterback Brad Kaaya and running back Joseph Yearby.\nCalifornia at Utah, 10 p.m., ESPN\nThe Utes have impressed with a pair of wins over ranked teams (Michigan, Oregon) and have risen to No. 5 in the rankings. But the Golden Bears will pose a threat behind quarterback Jared Goff, who is ranked in the top 10 nationally in several passing categories.\njjuliano@phillynews.com\n@joejulesinq", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/joejulesinq", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=collegegearArticle&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2Fpages%2FCOLLEGE"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:24:16.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
