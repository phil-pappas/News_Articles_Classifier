(AP) — Papagayo E. became the first horse from Norway to win the $1 million Yonkers International Trot at Yonkers Raceway on Saturday. \nDriven by Ulf Ohlsson, Papagayo E. defeated Timoko of France by a half-length in 2:26 in the 1 1-4 mile stakes and returned $21.60 for a $2 wager at 9-1. \nPace-setter American Creatine of the United States finished third. The favorite Bee A Magician of Canada was sixth. \nThe 10 premier trotters in the world from six countries — including Italy and Sweden — competed for the richest trotting purse in New York state. \nTom Anderson and Claes Sjolin, the owners of Papagayo E., watched their 5-year-old stallion earn his 12th career victory in the final strides. \n“Ulf gave him an absolutely perfect drive,” Anderson said. “I was confident going into the race.” \nOhlsson said he liked the tempo and power of his horse. \n“My biggest concern was Creatine holding on long enough until there was room for us to get through on the inside,” he said. \nThe Yonkers half-mile oval last hosted the International Trot in 1995. The event was revived by raceway president and CEO Tim Rooney.
