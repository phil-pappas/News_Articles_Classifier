He succeeds Emilio Nardone, who held the job for two years before resigning this offseason. \n\"I'm very pleased that Joe is our new head wrestling coach,\" said Sanacore. \"We had a committee go through the interview process, and I feel they made the right choice.\" \nPizzi has long-standing Belleville roots. His parents, Joseph and Linda, are both Belleville High graduates who continue to reside in the township. The elder Joseph Pizzi was a fireman for many years in town. \nCoach Pizzi was an assistant on Nardone's staff last season. Nardone, of course, is widely acclaimed to be the greatest wrestler in the storied history of Belleville High grappling, having won two NJSIAA championships for the Bucs in 1991 and 1992. Nardone is the only two-time state champion in BHS history. His brother, Armando, also won a state title for Belleville in 1988. \nWrestling has been one of the most popular high school sports in Belleville. Pizzi is just the fifth man to hold the head coaching job in the last 50 years, however he is also the third in the last three years to be the program's head coach. Joe Nisivoccia held the job for 28 years before stepping down in 2013. Nardone followed for two seasons and now, it's Pizzi's program. \n\"Joe's knowledge of the sport is outstanding, and with him as an assistant here last year, I think it's a good step for our program, overall,\" said Sanacore. \nPizzi is also an educator in the Belleville school system, and works at the Belleville Middle School. \nWe'll have much more on the new coach in next week's edition. \nEmail: Mike051893@aol.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:12:43.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
