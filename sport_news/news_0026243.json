Getty \nManchester United forward Wayne Rooney is a major doubt for England's penultimate Euro 2016 qualifier clash against Estonia on Friday (9 October) after picking up an ankle knock during the Red Devils' 3-0 loss at the hands of Arsenal on Sunday (4 October). The Three Lions skipper missed training for a second day in a row on Wednesday (7 October) and is unlikely to be risked by manager Roy Hodgson, since they have already booked their place in next summer's European Championship in France. \nAccording to the Guardian , the former Everton star will also not travel with the squad for their final qualifier against Lithuania on Monday (12 October), if he fails to recover sufficiently to play a part in the game on Friday. Theo Walcott is expected to lead the line-up for England, owing to his impressive performances in a similar position for the Gunners this season, which included an assured and determined showing during their win over arch rivals United. \nThe Arsenal forward has been deployed in his preferred central striker's role by Arsene Wenger this season, and he is now ahead of Olivier Giroud in the pecking order at the Emirates Stadium. The England international has started every game for the Gunners since the Frenchman's sending off during the Champions League loss against Dinamo Zagreb on 16 September. \nGary Cahill is set to be given the captain's armband in Rooney's absence , and apart from Walcott, Hodgson has other options in Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy and Danny Ings, who can occupy the central striker's role. The latter of the trio, however, is also a doubt after missing two training sessions with a minor knock. The Gunners forward , though, is hoping that he gets the nod following his impressive showing against the 20-time English champions on Sunday. \n\"I have had to wait my time. It has been well documented I have wanted to play up front and Arsenal have given me the opportunity, which is great. It is taking that form into England and trying to stay there, that is the next goal in my career,\" Walcott is quoted as saying by the Guardian. \n\"I've played up front for Arsenal, so there's an opportunity there, but again I can operate on the right, which I've been doing most of my career. Harry Kane has done very well for England. Danny Ings has come in and Jamie Vardy is the leading English goalscorer in the Premier League. We're all completely different players so they are great options for a manager to have,\" the former Southampton striker added.
