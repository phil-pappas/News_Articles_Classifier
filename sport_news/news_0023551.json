These guys are like my family and we all played together today and didn’t give up,\" said West Milford wide receiver Austin Hopler. \nBoth teams entered overtime knotted at 14 with West Milford garnering all of the momentum with 14 unanswered second half points. The Highlanders took the opening overtime possession into field goal range where Anthony Pellegrino nailed a clutch field goal for the game’s eventual game-winning score from 32-yard out. \nThe units as a whole put the bow on the West Milford come from behind victory as PV set up for the game tying score from 34-yards out. \nPellegrino would come up big once again blasting off the edge to block the attempt and seal the win for West Milford. The unit accounted for not only the game-winning score, but also forced a critical miss at the end of regulation that would have won the game for the Hornets. \n\"Special teams has been such a huge part of our team this year…it’s about time that we’ve started to make plays on special teams,\" said Hopler. \nWest Milford’s unlikely comeback was all sparked by the play of it’s passing attack. Late in the third quarter needing a play quarterback Anthony Hanratty connected on a seam route to Hopler on an 81-yard catch and run to turn the tide in the favor of West Milford. \nHopler’s first of two scores put the Hornet defense on their heels as West Milford gained confidence. Hopler finished the game with four catches for 130 yards and two touchdowns. \n\"We went in at halftime pretty upset and we knew we needed one spark to get it going. I ran a pretty good route and Hanratty threw a beautiful ball and everyone was doing their job,\" said Hopler. \nAccording to their Head Coach it was only a matter of time for the Highlander team to break through against the Hornet defense. \n\"It feels good. Going into halftime down 14 they were shutting us out we had to change our mentality…I said ‘whatever you’ve got to do, you’ve got to get motivated to want to come out in the second half and change our mentality and our kids did it,\" said Donald Dougherty. \nAfter a stalled drive on their ensuing possession the West Milford defense buckled down once more to put the pressure on Passaic Valley. \nThe special teams unit started their dominance with a partially blocked punt that set up the Highlanders with a shortened field at the Hornets 39-yard line. \nAided by a fourth down pass interference call the Highlanders were given new life to tie up the game. Capitalizing off of a blatant mismatch in coverage West Milford went back to Hopler to try and knot the game up. \nJust one play after a missed call took a touchdown off the board the Highlanders rebounded as Hoplers 25-yard catch and run sprung by a number of solid edge blocks tied the game at 14 with 3:22 remaining to set up the overtime heroics. \n\"Some things don’t go your way throughout the game and it’s all about how you react to that. Not only reacting to the good things, but reacting to the bad ones as well and that’s what makes a football team,\" said Dougherty. \nWest Milford’s victory improves the team to 2-3 on the season as they will host Bergenfield. \n\"A win solves a lot of problems especially when we’ve been down the last couple of weeks. A win could not only motivate you but give you a lot of confidence going into the next one so we’ve just got to ride the wave and I’m hoping for a huge game on our homecoming Friday night,\" said Hopler. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:55:53.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
