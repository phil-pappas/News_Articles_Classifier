He was originally expected to miss eight to 10 weeks. \nTrainer Mike Goforth says Brewer will wear a yellow non-contact jersey in practice and his progress will be closely monitored. \nHis possible participation in Friday night's game against North Carolina State could be a game-time decision. \nGoforth says running back Marshawn Williams reinjured his left knee in practice on Sept. 29 and will miss the rest of the season. Williams had the knee surgically repaired in December. The Hokies expect Williams to make a complete recovery. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:25:57.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
