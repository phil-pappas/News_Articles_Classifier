He was limited again Thursday and now, according to Adam Schefter of ESPN , Luck is \"legitimately questionable\" to play against the Jaguars on Sunday. \nOne concern for the Colts? They've got two games in less than a week, both divisional. After Jacksonville on Sunday the Colts draw the Texans on Thursday Night Football . \nPer Schefter, it's \"unlikely Luck throws much, or at all, before Sunday.\"\nAll of this means Luck is a legit game-time decision. Which means Matt Hasselbeck might end up getting a start against Jacksonville. \n\nLuck was limited in practice Wednesday.
