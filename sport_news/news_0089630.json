(Photo by Donald Miralle/Getty Images) Former San Diego State quarterback Kevin O’Connell is heading back to Qualcomm Stadium as the Cleveland Browns quarterbacks coach when they take on the Chargers Sunday. The Browns named O’Connell their new QB coach on February 17, 2015 replacing Dowell Loggains. The move got a lot of attention because O’Connell worked with Cleveland quarterback Johnny Manziel before the ’14 NFL Draft making people think there was a chance Manzeil would be named starter. But he has a history of working with elite quarterbacks preparing them for the draft. This past year O’Connell worked with Marcus Mariotta, Jameis Winston and Bryce Petty before he joined Cleveland. Before joining the Browns coaching staff O’Connell was a football stand out in San Diego. After graduating from La Costa Canyon High School where he was the Team’s Most Valuable Player his senior year, O’Connell headed to SDSU. With the Aztecs (2004-07) he was a four-year team captain before graduating in 2007. O’Connell holds the school record for most yards by a quarterback in their career with 1,312 and is second in career rushing touchdowns among QB’s. In 2008 the New England Patriots drafted O’Connell with their third pick of the third round, 94th overall. He made his NFL debut Sept. 21, 2008 against the Dolphins in the fourth quarter. O’Connell has been a member of the Lions, Jets, Dolphins and Chargers.
