They'd gone into last week's 70-17 romp of Rice bent on regaining an edge that Briles worried had softened in opening wins over SMU and Lamar.\nWhile Baylor picked apart some of its early performances, it has won every game of its oft-derided warmup schedule by 35 points or more.\n\"I felt like the team was where we needed it to be,\" Briles said of the Rice victory. \"And it's the first time that I felt it this year. We have to be a devastatingly dominant football team. That's the way we have to play. I felt at times the other day that we were that.\n\"Our backs are not full of pats. We have a long way to go ... but we do have the potential to be pretty good.\"\nBaylor and Tech will be playing for a newly commissioned trophy, which is topped with a black football. The trophy lists all 73 results of the series, which happens to be tied at 36-36-1.\nBut it's not like the programs need shiny extra incentives. Tech is coming off its wild 55-52 loss at home to then-No. 3 TCU. Matchups between the Red Raiders and Bears regularly produce intense humdingers, even as Baylor has won four straight in the series.\nBaylor ranks No. 1 (767.0 yards per game) in the Football Bowl Subdivision in total offense, Tech No. 5 (594.5 ypg).\n\"It's two offenses trying to get after each other's throat,\" Baylor quarterback Seth Russell said. \"There's a lot of emotions between us and Tech. ...You have to use those at the right moments. This game is going to be a good test for us and also for them. ... It's going to be a firefight.\"\nRussell played a key role in last season's 48-46 win as a backup. With starting quarterback Bryce Petty knocked out of the game after a high hit in the third quarter, Russell had to pilot the Bears the rest of the way. Tech made a ferocious effort but couldn't quite come back all the way after trailing 42-17 with 6:44 left in the third quarter.\n\"I got thrown into the fire and I didn't answer as well as I needed to,\" Russell said. \"With these first three games under my belt, I feel more confident, more poised.\"\nRussell went 12 of 16 for 277 yards and six touchdowns against Rice, and didn't throw an interception for the first time this season.\n\"The whole deal is to stay in the moment with him,\" Briles said. \"A lot of times people that are gifted ... it's hard to keep them motivated. That's an area that we're working on with him. Every play is the play of the game. ... He was really sharp, and that's what we're going to need.\"\nOf course, help is plentiful. Versatile receiver Corey Coleman leads the country in touchdown catches (8), Baylor leads the FBS in rushing (379.7 yards per game) and so on.\nBaylor's defense, which looked shaky at times in the opening two games, held Rice to under 300 yards.\n\"It was more about just playing with a better edge,\" linebacker Taylor Young said. \"It comes in practice, every day in practice. Focusing in on your assignment and your job. We made it our job to practice harder and faster.\"\nBaylor will need it as it opens Big 12 play, set on winning a third-straight title.\n\"We're amping up at the right time,\" Briles said. \"We feel like we did what we should've through our nonconference schedule. We know in conference that things are going to get a little more important, a little tougher as we go along.\"\nTwitter: @khairopoulos\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-29T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:00:22.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
