A senior official in Jerusalem said that they would continue this discussion in the coming days.\nEarlier Sunday, a senior official at the Shin Bet security service said at the weekly Israeli government meeting that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is not encouraging terrorism \"and is even instructing his security forces to prevent terror attacks as much as possible.\"\nHowever, according to a senior official that took part in the meeting, the Shin Bet official said the opposite about senior Palestinian Authority and PLO officials. These officials, he said, \"are part of the incitement campaign that is exasperating the violence.\"\nNevertheless, the Shin Bet official stressed that the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement, and Hamas, are the main forces of incitement that have led to the current escalation . He added that most of the Palestinians who carried out the attacks over the past few weeks were individuals who were not associated with institutionalized terror networks.\nBarak Ravid\nHaaretz Correspondent\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/barak.ravid.75?fref=ts", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://twitter.com/#!/BarakRavid"], "published": "2015-10-12T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:46:31.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
