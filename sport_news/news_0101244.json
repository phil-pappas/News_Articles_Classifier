Meyer's restaurants include the Modern, where the effort will start first, as well as Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern and Blue Smoke.\nMeyer and his Union Square Hospitality Group announced the change on Wednesday. He says a tipping system isn't fair to all restaurant workers, since regulations don't allow for some workers like kitchen staff to share in gratuities even though they are vital to the customer's experience.\nMelissa Fleischut of the New York State Restaurant Association says other restaurants could be inspired to follow suit.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:53:30.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
