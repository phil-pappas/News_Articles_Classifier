NBC 24 and 1370 WSPD held this debate.\nThey gave each candidate the chance to explain why they're the best fit for the seat for Toledo Mayor. One of those questions was about what each would do about of gang violence, that hasn't been done before.\nSandy Drabik Collins says, \"I do believe that we do not have enough police officers, and part of my platform is to increase the amount of police officers.\"\nPaula Hicks-Hudson suggests \"that we all have to give an alternative. That could be either education opportunities or employment opportunities.\"\nOpal Covey says \"there will be less crime when we get more businesses in the city.\"\nSandy Spang thinks \"it's time our youth commission within the city. I think it needs to be a more active department.\"\nCarty Finkbeiner says that we need to \"let the police be policemen; focus upon gang leaders.\"\nHowever, Mike Bell says that \"you cannot police your way out of this situation.\"\nMike Ferner claims that \"policing, of course, is important. But we have to address the root causes of why people join gangs.\"\nYou can watch our debate next Wednesday, October 28th at 7:00 P.M. right here on 13abc", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/WNWO+Debate.JPG", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/WNWO+Debate.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:04:02.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
