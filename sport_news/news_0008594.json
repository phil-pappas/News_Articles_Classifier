However, the Knights have turned their season around with three consecutive region wins behind the play of running back/defensive back Caden Herring.Against Alpharetta on Oct. 9, the senior rushed for 149 yards and a touchdown, had 70 yards receiving on offense along with and 8 tackles two pass breakups on defense in Centennial’s 38-35 win.Herring had another standout performance on Sept. 25 during the Knights’ 35-21 victory over Johns Creek as he rushed for 103 yards, had 49 receiving yards on offense; returned a kickoff for 99 yards on special teams and defensively, had six tackles and an interception. He finished the night with four total touchdowns.“Caden is so important to the football team,” Knights’ coach Lenny Gregory said. “Any coach in America would love to have him. He’s an awesome kid on and off the field. Caden is an excellent student and an incredible leader.”Herring has been happy with the development of the team.“We’ve had better tempo in practice and started to gain confidence,” he said. “I’ve had my number called and tried to do my best for the team.”This is Herring’s first year playing on both sides of the ball.“I’ve usually played only offense but thankful the coaches have given me a chance to play both sides this year,” Herring said. “I’m enjoying it.”With four games left in the regular season, the Knights have begun to make their push to make the postseason for the first time since 2011.“I think we have a chance to make the playoffs as long as we stay focused and do our job,” Herring said.Herring also runs on the school’s track team, specifically in the 100-meter and 400-meter dash. Off the field, Herring is a member of the Young Men Service League at Centennial that provides community service to the area.Herring will be a preferred walk-on for the University of Georgia football team and plans to major in business marketing. “I’ll play where ever Georgia wants me to on the field,” he said.The Knights return to action this Friday in a home contest against Habersham Central.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:42:51.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
