(Getty Images) \nMichigan punter Blake O'Neill has been scapegoated for Michigan's loss to Michigan State on Saturday after he fumbled the snap on the last play of the game, allowing allowed Spartan Jalen Watts-Jackson to scoop up the ball and run it in for win. \nSince the game, many Michigan \"fans\" have spewed vitriol and hate at the punter, leading to Michigan athletic director Jim Hackett writing an open letter denouncing that minority and supporting the punter . \nOf course, had O'Neill not mishandled the snap, Michigan likely would've won, but there are far too many factors to lay the blame on one play or player. What if the line had blocked better on the play? What if the snap had been perfect? What if the Michigan offense had been able to pad the score a bit? What if the defense hadn't allowed the Spartans to get within a touchdown? Bottom line, you can't lay all the blame on one person. \nThe Australian punter isn't the first -- nor will he be the last -- player blamed for all his team's problems. That list is far too long to recount here. But there are a few significant examples of players who were scapegoated at one point, only to find redemption. Ralph Branca gave up \"The Shot Heard 'Round the World\" to Bobby Thomson, which lost the 1951 National League pennant for the Brooklyn Dodgers, but the two became friends later in life . Nick Anderson missed four consecutive free throws in Game 1 of the 1995 NBA Finals, which his Orlando magic eventually lost, but he was able move on from it and his nickname \"The Brick.\" Brad Lidge gave up a three-run homer to Albert Pujols that cost the Astros the 2005 NLCS, but went 7-for-7 in postseason save attempts in 2008 to help the Phillies win a World Series. Redemption is never far away from failure. \nHere's hoping, with time, that O'Neill can find his own redemption, like some of these other former goats. Bill Buckner \nRed Sox fans -- one of the biggest and most fervent fanbases in all of American sports -- hated poor Buckner for a good 18 years after his colossal error cost the Sawx a World Series championship in 1986. \nBut even Buckner was able to overcome the hate an one day laugh about it. He appeared alongside Larry David in a 2011 episode of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" where Buckner saved a baby from a burning building and actually got to play the hero for once. (Of course, it helped that this was after the Sox broke the \"Curse of the Bambino\" in 2004 and had one another title since then.) \nBuckner was also honored at Fenway Park on Opening Day 2008, following the Red Sox's second championship of the century, and all was forgiven. Scott Norwood \nNorwood is best known for the famous 1991 \"Wide Right\" field-goal attempt, a would-be-game-winning kick he missed for the Bills at the end of Super Bowl XXV against the Giants. It was the first of four consecutive Super Bowl defeats for Buffalo. \nBut, after the Super Bowl, at a rally held in Buffalo , Bills fans showed him all the support in the world and chanted his name, which should be a reminder to O'Neill that even thought the vocal minority of Michigan fans is coming after him, the majority likely still have his back. Adam Griffith \nHere's another kicker on the list, because it seems as if special teams guys always get the blame. Griffith is the Alabama placekicker whose 2013 field-goal attempt at the end of regulation in the Iron Bowl came up just inches short, allowing Auburn's Chris Davis to return it 109 yards for the win. \nGriffith has lived an amazing life, going from a Polish orphanage to starter at Alabama. (Here's a wonderful ESPN piece on him returning to Poland to meet his birth parents.) And he hasn't allowed that one kick to define him. \n\"Make or miss, it's just a football game, you know,\" he said in the ESPN piece. Chris Webber \nO'Neill can also learn a lesson from another Michigan Man. Webber was lambasted for calling a timeout in the 1993 NCAA championship game when the Wolverines had none left. He was assessed a technical foul and UNC won. \nSince the incident, Webber has rarely, if ever, spoken about that blunder. He chose to let his playing do the talking and went on to a 15-year NBA career, as well as a post-playing days career as a TV analyst. Now, his timeout is one of the last things people think about when they see him. \nSo maybe O'Neill should keep his head down and let his game do the talking. He did almost set the Michigan record for longest punt when he blasted one 80 yards downfield in the first quarter against Michigan State. If he can keep that up, he'll help his team by giving opponents awful field position. Maybe he'll even kick well enough to earn a spot on an NFL roster one day. At that point, his fumble from Saturday will only be an afterthought. \n* * * Cy Brown writes about soccer and other stuff for Sports on Earth.
