Because it looks awfully familiar.\nMore than 20 years ago, that would have been stunning.\nBut over the past 7 1 / 2 years, since coach Lloyd Carr left Michigan, Northwestern is 55-39 and Michigan 50-43.\nThis opponent is the Wolverines' current mirror image, so it's only fitting this is a benchmark game for Michigan to prove its spot in the national discussion.\nU-M's most recent win over a team ranked No. 13 or higher? Sept. 27, 2008, over No. 9 Wisconsin, four games into Rich Rodriguez's career.\nThis season shows that the schools match up as well as any other.\nHearing Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald describe the start of his team this year sounds like he could be talking about Michigan after a 2014 filled with distractions. Just as the Wildcats had the cloud of players trying to unionize hanging overhead, U-M dealt with a national controversy about head injuries, the departure of its athletic director during the season and its coach after the season, and a domestic violence allegation during the bye week, losing a starter.\n\"The guys made an emphasis in the off-season, starting in January, to focus on what we can control,\" Fitzgerald said in words that also fit the Wolverines. \"They were absolutely terrific all off-season, the accountability, the leadership, and that has permeated throughout our whole football team.\"\nNorthwestern (35 points allowed all season) and Michigan (38) rank 1-2 nationally in scoring defense. Michigan is first in third-down defense (19.4%), Northwestern is second (20%). Both are in the top five in total defense.\nOn offense, it's more of the same. Both have a game-managing quarterback — Michigan's Jake Rudock is 102nd nationally in passing efficiency, Northwestern's Clayton Thorson is 103rd — and rely on the running game for a large part of the offense (Michigan at 57% and Northwestern at 71%).\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nU-M's Lewis graded as best cornerback in country\nThrough five games, the teams are not even a first down apart, as their total offense yardage is separated by 8 total yards.\nEven the personnel looks familiar.\n\"We're playing a lot of guys, a lot of different talent and skill sets,\" Fitzgerald said. \"But they're playing really hard for each other. We feel like we kind of gave away what we value and who we are the last few years. We had a theme to go out and earn it every rep, every day, and obviously that's carried over to Saturdays.\"\nThose similarities aren't the only reason anyone looking at the betting line, which opened with Michigan favored by 12 and remained at 7 1 / 2 on Friday, had to chuckle.\nThe half might be more accurate than the seven.\nFor the past three years, that's about all that has separated these teams.\nIn Ann Arbor in 2012, Northwestern led, 31-28, with U-M buried on its 38-yard line with 9 seconds left. A 53-yard Michigan bomb to Roy Roundtree — which he had to juggle the ball to himself while falling — set up the overtime-forcing field goal. The Wolverines scored first in overtime in the 38-31 win.\nIn Evanston in 2013, Northwestern led, 9-6, with seconds to play when U-M raced its field-goal team onto the field — complete with Drew Dileo essentially sliding in the holding spot as the ball was snapped — for an overtime-forcing field goal, a play U-M analyst Jim Brandstatter said he'd \"never seen,\" especially in the rain. The Wolverines pulled out a 27-19 three-overtime win.\nIn Evanston in 2014, a game that was scoreless at halftime, Fitzgerald wasn't accepting another overtime heartbreak. With 3 seconds left and his team having just scored to close within 10-9, he opted to try for the two-point conversion and the win. Defensive end Frank Clark closed in on the Northwestern quarterback and the two-pointer failed, giving U-M another heart-stopping win.\n\"It serves as motivation,\" Northwestern defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz said. \"Yeah, we're frustrated. We've had a legitimate chance to beat them three straight years. Two years ago, they didn't score a touchdown in regulation. Last year, they scored only one touchdown in regulation. But that's part of life, that's part of football.\n\"We're just trying to figure out how to make one more play.\"\nIn this game, with these programs, that's usually enough.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nMichigan vs. Northwestern: Scouting report, prediction\nCheck out more staff predictions here .
