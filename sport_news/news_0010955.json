Puerto Rican icon Miguel Cotto has been the only boxer to sell out the Garden in recent years, thus there’s no denying now that Golovkin is a star.\nThe last time Golovkin (33-0, 30 KOs) headlined at the Garden, a crowd of roughly 9,000 attended his three-round demolition of Australia’s Daniel Geale (31-4, 16 KOs) in July 2014.\nMontreal’s Lemieux (34-2, 31 KOs), though a 16-1 underdog, is a more appealing opponent than Geale because he, too, is a powerful puncher. That partially explains why more than twice as many fans will attend this card.\nIt is more the consequence, however, of the likeable, mild-mannered Golovkin becoming a fascinating fighter even casual sports fans want to watch, no matter whom he fights. Ratings for his eight fights broadcast by HBO since September 2012 have steadily increased, as have crowds for his fights in New York and the Los Angeles area. Even such stars as Cotto and recently retired Sergio Martinez have avoided facing Golovkin.\nThat’s what makes Golovkin’s rise to stardom all the more impressive. He still hasn’t faced a high-profile opponent, yet by methodically destroying B-level boxers or worse, he has developed into a proven attraction.\nThe Lemieux match also will mark Golovkin’s pay-per-view debut ($59.99 in HD).\nGolovkin’s critics claim his perfect record doesn’t mean much, that his aura of invincibility is overrated because he hasn’t beaten star fighters on his way to 20 straight knockouts. His recent reluctance to consider moving up to 168 pounds to face undefeated super middleweight champion Andre Ward (28-0, 15 KOs) also generated negative attention.\nGolovkin understandably would prefer to remain at middleweight and fight the winner of the Nov. 21 showdown between Cotto (40-4, 33 KOs) and Mexico’s Canelo Alvarez (45-1-1, 32 KOs).\nWhomever Golovkin fights, it’s clear he’ll captivate large audiences. With Floyd Mayweather Jr. retired and Manny Pacquiao approaching retirement, boxing needs as many of those attractions as it can get.\nTwitter: @Idecboxing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:18:26.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
