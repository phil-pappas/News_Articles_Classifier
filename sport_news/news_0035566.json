The Stars and Stripes defeated the Canucks 3-1 while on their way to racking up two more decisive victories during group play. However, the U.S fell prey to a feisty Honduras team in this past weekend's semifinal game – losing 0-2. While Canada's performance was not as authoritative as the U.S. throughout the tournament (1-1-1- in group play), it was good enough for the team to earn a trip to the semifinals. With an Olympic berth on the line, the Canadians hopes were dashed after they ran into a determined Mexico squad that ended up defeating the team from north of the boarder 2-0.\nFor both the U.S. and Canada , this game is a must win. Simply stated, the loser will not go the Rio 2016 Olympics. The winner will travel to Brazil next March for a one-game playoff against Colombia to decide the final berth in next summer's tournament.\nFans can check their local TV listings, or visit www.nbcuniverso.com/encuentra , to find channel information for NBC UNIVERSO on their cable, satellite and telco systems.\nWHO:\nChampionship Final – HONDURAS vs. MEXICO\nWHEN:\nOn Tue., Oct. 13 at 10:00p ET / 7:00p PT\nWHAT:\nEl Tri will defend its Olympic Gold Medal. Mexico defeated Canada during the semifinals of this tournament this past weekend and earned a berth in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . But, before Mexico makes the trip to Brazil next summer to begin its bid as back-to-back Olympic Champion, the squad is first looking to repeat as CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying Champion. Mexico will face Honduras and a victory would add a seventh Pre-Olympic Qualifying Tournament title to the young Mexicans' resume. Honduras can claim its third overall qualifying tournament title with a win over Mexico . Los Catrachos defeated the U.S. during their semifinal match to earn its trip to Rio. The 2016 Games will be the Hondurans third consecutive Olympic tournament and fourth overall.\nMAKING THE CALL:\nAward-winner and internationally acclaimed sportscaster Andres Cantor will bring his unique style and soccer expertise to the broadcast booth for NBC UNIVERSO.
