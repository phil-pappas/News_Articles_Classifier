Then some pain in his pain led to a trip to the doctors and then a very scary diagnoses that possibly could be life-threatening:\nCancer.\nNow, everyone in the Flyers organization is praying for Pyett, who has Sarcoma in his upper left leg.\nALSO: 5 positives from Flyers' opener; Laughton line stands out\n\"He's in our family,\" Flyers GM Ron Hextall said Friday after his team practiced at BB&T Center for Saturday night's game against the Florida Panthers. \"He's under our umbrella and he's knows that. We'll get him the best care.\"\nMeantime, further medical tests did bring encouraging results.\n\"He's been through a battery of tests over the last two weeks,\" Hextall said. \"What we know, the tests have come back in a good way. I think when you look cancer whether it's spread or not, the indications are that it's fairly isolated in his leg.\"\nPyett will get his treatment in Philadelphia at Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He'll start out with four consecutive days of chemo every three weeks until he's ready for surgery that will remove the tumor, Hextall said.\n\"I've already told him if he needs hotel room down our way when he's getting the treatment, he's welcome to it,\" Hextall said. \"We care about our players.\"\nThe Flyers lost a minor leaguer who had played a few games with them to cancer in August 1997 when winger Yanick Dupre passed at age 24 following a 16-month battle with leukemia.\nOne of Dupre's teammates during his 35 games for the 1994-95 and '95-96 Flyers was Hextall.\n\"Great kid,\" Hextall recall.\nHe feels the same about Pyett.\n\"He's a great kid,\" Hextall said. \"I'm actually talked to him a few times and he's obviously had his life turned upside down. He's got a great attitude and hopefully things go in the right direction.\n\"I do know there's a lot of positive signs ... and the kid's got a great attitude. I guess so far, so good.\"\nRandy Miller may be reached at rmiller@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @RandyJMiller .
