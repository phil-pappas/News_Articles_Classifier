The Americans won for the sixth straight time, 15 1/2-14 1/2, only this was one came down to the final match. And the emotion was never stronger — on both sides. U.S. captain Jay Haas made his son one of two wild-card selections, and he put him out in the last of 12 singles matches at Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea against the local star, Bae Sang-moon, playing in his final event before he starts his mandatory military service in South Korea. Bae did everything he could to give the International team a chance by holing a 10-foot putt on the 16th to stay 1 down and nearly holing a bunker shot on the 17th for par to extend the match. Needing to win the par-5 18th to share the cup, Bae stubbed his chip short of the green. As the ball rolled back down the slope, Bae sank to his knees and covered his eyes as caddie Matt Minister consoled him. Haas blasted out of a bunker to 6 feet, and Bae conceded the birdie putt, giving Haas a 2-up victory.
