The owner did not want to be identified due to the sensitivity of the topic.\nGoodell didn’t attend New England’s season opener last month, sensing that his presence at Gillette Stadium would be a distraction. Given all the venom aimed in his direction as the NFL threw the book at the Patriots – including a four-game suspension for star quarterback Tom Brady until it was vacated by a federal judge – that was a smart move.\nAnd Goodell won’t be at Sunday night’s nationally-televised game at Indianapolis, where the Patriots and Colts will engage in a rematch of the AFC title game … which ignited the most bizarre investigation in NFL history, revolving around the Patriots’ use of deflated footballs.\nYet last week Goodell was seen cordially chatting with Kraft during NFL owners meetings in New York, a spirit that several executives maintain also existed behind the scenes. They also attended a dinner the night before the meeting, with other owners in attendance, after hours of committee meetings at league headquarters.\nWhatever hard feelings may exist for Kraft over Deflategate – and there were many, as detailed in the team’s written rebuttal and amplified by Kraft during a summer press conference where he declared he has “lost faith” in the league office – have been put aside as the NFL strategizes to grow a business than exceeds $11 billion annually in revenues.\nIn other words, Kraft is done putting logs on the fire.\n“I think the partnership is strong,” Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay told USA TODAY Sports.\nIrsay might be the last person you’d expect to weigh in about Kraft and Deflategate.\nAfter all, it was Irsay’s team that turned in Kraft’s team to launch the investigation for the ages.\nBut Irsay insists that his relationship with Kraft hasn’t changed. Both are members of the NFL’s finance committee. While they have worked through typical issues and challenges, Irsay said they have yet to have a discussion about Deflategate.\n“I know it may sound shocking, but there are other issues that go on,” said Irsay.\nStill, when the Deflategate documentary comes years from now, some of the most striking footage will be the venting from Kraft, who has contended his team was punished, excessively, on the basis of circumstantial evidence. When the Patriots arrived in Arizona for Super Bowl XLIX, he tried to set a tone for the week by maintaining his faith in Brady and Bill Belichick, while also expressing his wish for an apology when the Patriots were exonerated.\nInstead, the NFL found that Brady was at least “generally aware” of an alleged scheme to deflate footballs. The Patriots were fined $1 million and docked two draft picks, including a first-rounder next spring – discipline that Kraft reluctantly accepted. Brady’s punishment, still pending an NFL appeal, was harsher because he didn’t fully cooperate with the investigation.\nIn Kraft’s summer press conference, it’s also notable that rather than personally admonish Goodell, Kraft directed his most pointed ire at league attorneys, and presumably general counsel Jeff Pash.\nIn the meantime, he has carried on as one of the league’s most active owners, wielding powerful influence as a member of ownership committees that address crucial matters such as the league’s plans to relocate a team or two to Los Angeles, its broadcasting deals and global expansion.\nYet Deflategate isn’t over yet, with the NFL appealing to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n“There are a couple more sensitive times on this issue, but time will go by,” Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told USA TODAY Sports.\nKraft’s decision in May to accept the NFL’s punishment – handed down by executive vice president Troy Vincent, and supported by Goodell – was an indication that he was not poised to go rogue.\nFighting the NFL’s punishment could have meant Kraft suing his partners, as late Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis did multiple times.\nEven so, Kraft came off as a man scorned when Goodell upheld the Brady suspension. I’m guessing that he felt by accepting the team penalties, the Commissioner would lighten the penalty on Brady.\nKraft isn’t the first one to take it on the chin when it comes to NFL discipline. That point was hammered by other owners, including John York of the San Francisco 49ers, in expressing their support for Goodell throughout the process.\nKraft was also said to be upset with owners, including Jones, who vehemently supported the commissioner.\nJones said he has talked it through with Kraft, one of his closest friends among owners, but added, “We’ve probably not finished the talks. We haven’t talked enough.”\nOver the years, Goodell has disciplined Jones hard for salary cap violations and for violating a gag order.\n“And before he was commissioner, he wasn’t exactly ‘Sweet Roger’ in some of the negotiations I had with the NFL,“ Jones said. “It’s like the old adage, ‘If they’ll bite as a puppy, they’ll bite as a dog.’ I knew he would bite.”\nAnd Kraft has barked enough.\nFollow NFL columnist Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/JarrettBell", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:04:22.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
