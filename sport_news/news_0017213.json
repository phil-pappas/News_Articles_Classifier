(Photo: Duane Burleson, AP) \nAuburn Hills â€” The injury bug has bitten the Pistons for much of the preseason, but they may have dodged a serious injury from Wednesday's game.\nShooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope suffered a foot injury in the loss to the Charlotte Hornets at The Palace, but coach Stan Van Gundy said it isn't serious. Caldwell-Pope had an MRI on his left foot, which he twisted in the first quarter, and the results were negative.\n\"It's nothing long-term; he'll be back probably in practice on the weekend but he'll be back for Tuesday for sure,\" Van Gundy said. \"(It's) a bone bruise and a little sprain.\"\nThe Pistons open the regular season Tuesday in Atlanta.\nCaldwell-Pope played just 10 minutes Wednesday but scored eight points.\nThe Pistons have been hampered this month with numerous injuries. Steve Blake (concussion), Aron Baynes (ankle) and Reggie Jackson (Achilles) have all missed time, along with Cartier Martin (hand), Adonis Thomas (Achilles) and Brandon Jennings (Achilles).\nVan Gundy said Caldwell-Pope will miss the preseason finale against the Hawks on Friday.\nBlake practiced fully Thursday and is set to play Friday, his first game of the preseason.\nRod.Beard@detroitnews.com \nTwitter.com/detnewsRodBeard", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:18:19.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
