(AP) - The U.S Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to pay $85,000 to settle EPA claims that it violated regulations in its handling of a hazardous chemical at the Army's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab in Hanover.\nThe EPA alleged that the Corps didn't comply with \"Risk Management Plan\" regulations in the federal Clean Air Act in its handling of anhydrous ammonia.\nThe EPA said in addition to typical refrigeration equipment, the lab had an emergency dump system outside from which ammonia could be discharged to a nearby storm water detention pond that drains into the Connecticut River. Because of its potential to harm the river, the Corps will be disabling the outdated technology and safeguarding the facility through other means.\nThis case stems from an August 2013 lab inspection.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:39:08.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
