(Kyodo News via AP) JAPAN OUT, MANDATORY CREDIT \nTOKYO (AP) — Japanese organizers have launched the design competition for a new logo for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to replace the emblem that was dropped amid plagiarism allegations. \nThe organizing committee says the competition is “open to everyone regardless of previous experience or formal qualifications,” including individuals or groups. \nApplications can be submitted online from Nov. 24 to Dec. 7. The winning entry will be announced next spring and sent to the Tokyo 2020 executive board for final approval. \nThe initial emblem came under intense scrutiny because of its similarity to the logo of a theater in Belgium. The Japanese emblem’s designer, Kenjiro Sano, stood by his work but it was eventually withdrawn.
