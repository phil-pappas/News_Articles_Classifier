He added a 53-yard touchdown rush in the fourth. \nHarpursville/Afton brought the score to 14-6 in the second quarter, after Josh Wilson scored on a nine-yard run. \nWalton answered right back, when Blake Hitt threw a 20-yard pass to Jordan Somers with 34 seconds left to extend the lead. \n“That was a big play for us,” said Walton coach Jim Hoover. “It put us up by two scores before the half.” \nDawson Beers capped the scoring for the Warriors after recovering a fumble in the Harpursville/Afton end zone. \nWalton will play Tioga in a semifinal game on Saturday at Binghamton Alumni Stadium at noon. \nSusquehanna Valley 37, Oneonta 8: Host SV scored 37 unanswered points after an 8-0 deficit to win in section 4 over Oneonta. Kyle Novobilski led the way with 71 yards on the ground. \nQuarterback Cameron Manchester only completed three passes for 77 yards, but two of those resulted in scores for the Sabers. Alex Ewanow caught one of his passes in the third quarter for a touchdown, and Jason Moelder capped the scoring with a touchdown catch in the fourth. \nSV will travel to Chenango Valley this coming Saturday for the section 4 Class B semifinal. \nNewark Valley 47, Whitney Point 6: Chad Wright’s 78-yard interception return for a touchdown gave Newark Valley a 13-0 lead and sparked its offense as the Cardinals went soaring into the Class C sectional playoffs. \nWright’s interception return came after a fumble by the Cardinal’s offense, and squashed Whitney Point’s momentum. \nNewark Valley (7-1) received tremendous praise from Whitney Point coach Mike Hakes calling the Cardinals “a very well coached team and a class act.” \nHakes also gave credit the Nick Schermerhorn, saying, “He has a lot of the same traits as Vinnie Darpino. I like the way he controls their offense.” Schermerhorn ran for 35 yards and passed for 84 more and one touchdown. \nNewark Valley, their only loss to Class C’s top-ranked team Chenango Forks, will play the winner of Watkins Glen/O-M and Lansing for the Class C semifinal next Saturday. \nNick Cannon contributed.
