And I know the balance will come,\" he added. \nDjokovic's prize money for 2015 now stands at $16,041,009 with seven ATP tournaments to go, including next month's Paris Masters and World Tour finals in London. \nThe Serb's career earnings still trail Roger Federer's total of $94.7 million by over $6 million, but he's closing in on the Swiss star fast, thanks in part to Djokovic's close-knit support system which includes former champion Boris Becker. \n\"He's somebody that understands the kind of challenges and obstacles that I have to overcome mentally, mostly, as a top player fighting for the biggest trophies in our sport,\" explained Djokovic, reflecting on his relationship with his German coach. \n\"That's where he has contributed the most in my success ... he's been there and done that. Having Boris in my corner makes a difference not just to me, but also to my opponents as well. And we're a great team.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
