Courtesy of the Nassau Guardian 1 of 3 Order Reprint of this Story \nHurricane Joaquin continued hammering the Bahamas early Friday but began turning toward the north, taking a track that should steer clear of the U.S. coast. \nAt 2 p.m. Friday, the National Hurricane Center said the extremely dangerous Category 4 storm would likely batter the Bahamas through the day. New computer models aim the storm further east, away from the Carolinas and the heavily populated New Jersey-New York area, which had been devastated by Superstorm Sandy. The latest track takes the storm closer to Bermuda, keeping hurricane winds well offshore of the East Coast as it slowly weakens to a Category 1 by Sunday, then tropical storm by midweek. \nIn its latest advisory, the NHC said Joaquin was 25 miles southwest of San Salvador and had sped up to 5 mph. \nForecasters expect the track to shift even further east, reducing the threat of heavy rains and flooding that raised earlier concerns. Still, they caution the storm could trigger dangerous rip currents. \nIn the Bahamas, Joaquin ripped off roofs, uprooted trees and unleashed heavy flooding across the eastern and central islands on Friday. The U.S. Coast Guard was also searching for a cargo ship with a crew of 33 that reported taking on water after losing power early Thursday. \nCoast Guard officials said they received a call for help from the El Faro about 7:30 a.m. A satellite communication from the crew said the 735-foot ship had started listing but that the crew had stopped the water from coming in. A search helicopter was sent from Clearwater, but failed to find the ship. Two hurricane hunter planes in the area also failed to contact the ship, which was making its way from Jacksonville to Puerto Rico. A search will continue by both land and sea, the Coast Guard said. \nFierce winds from Joaquin also cut communications to several islands, most of them lightly populated. But there were no reports of fatalities or injuries, said Capt. Stephen Russell, the director of the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency. \nResidents reached by relatives said they were “trapped in their homes, and reported feeling as if their structures were caving in,” Russell said. “It’s too dangerous to go outside because the flood waters are so high, so we ask that persons stay inside and try to go into the most secure place of their home.” \nPower also was knocked out to several islands, and Leslie Miller, executive chairman of the Bahamas Electricity Corporation, said the company “is in no position to do much” to restore electricity. “All the airports are flooded,” he said. \nSchools, businesses and government offices were closed as the slow-moving storm roared through the island chain. \nStreets were largely deserted as people remained hunkered down on the island of Eleuthera, which was bracing for heavy winds later Friday. Some people were still making last-minute preparations, including Alexander Johnson, 61, who was moving his fishing boat with his brother, Solomon. \nThe powerful storm was expected to generate a potentially deadly storm surge, increased from earlier advisories to six to 12 feet, that could unleash life-threatening flash floods, forecasters said. Near shore, the storm could kick up lethal waves. The wet storm is also expected to dump between 12 and 18 inches of rain over the region, with up to 25 inches possible in some areas. \nPhotos posted on social media Thursday as Joaquin was still approaching showed several feet of water surrounding homes on Long Island, home to a few thousand people on the eastern edge of the central Bahamas. \n“It’s rough right now,” said Maxwell Burrows, 55, reached by phone from his home on Long Island. “The Internet is down. We don’t have any power and we are getting bad hurricane winds right now.” \nBurrows, a tile layer, said even Superstorm Sandy in 2012, which caused damage across the island, wasn’t as bad. “What I’m scared of is that the storm is taking so long to go; it’s like it’s not moving,” he said. \nJoaquin was indeed crawling, moving at just 3 mph Friday, almost stalled as it waited for an approaching front that forecasters expected to sweep it north and away from the Bahamas. Forecasters say the storm should start to speed up later today. \nCindy Bock who lived in the Salt Pond section of Long Island, said Thursday the rain pains were sporadic through late afternoon but she feared there would be a lot of damage if forecasters were right and Joaquin parked itself overhead for another day. \n“This is a farming and fishing community and it will impact it quite hard,” said Bock, an American retiree who moved to the island with her husband, Don, 17 years ago. \nHurricane winds extended 50 miles from the storm’s center while tropical storm winds reached about 205 miles, sending swells that have begun pounding the southeast U.S. coast. The swells are likely to spread north over the weekend. Even if the storm misses the U.S. entirely, the coast could see a prolonged period of high water and large waves that could cause significant beach erosion. \nA hurricane watch remained in effect for the central Bahamas and northwestern Bahamas including the Abacos, Berry Islands, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama Island, New Providence, the Acklins, Crooked Island, Mayaguana, Bimini, and Andros Island. Forecasters issued a warning for remaining islands, the Turks and Caicos and the southeastern half of Cuba. \nJoaquin is the first major threat to the East Coast since Superstorm Sandy in 2012, which came ashore just north of Atlantic City and ultimately caused $75 billion in damage, making it the second costliest storm in U.S. history. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:07:26.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
