Umm, no. Accuse us of negativity, but Steve Politi and I have correctly predicted the outcomes of Rutgers ' first four games.\nEveryone nailed their prediction of a Scarlet Knights win in their last game against Kansas. Of the 972 fan votes on NJ.com, 80 percent predicted a Rutgers victory .\nHere are our predictions for the Michigan State game:\nDan Duggan: Despite all of the reasons for optimism listed above, I'm not convinced Rutgers can compete with a high-level Big Ten opponent. And despite all of the hand-wringing over Michigan State's relatively slim margin of victory during its 5-0 start, the Spartans return many of the key pieces from last season's 45-3 win over Rutgers . I expect Michigan State's defensive line to dominate and the offense to click in a lopsided win.\nDuggan's Prediction: Michigan State 38, Rutgers 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:38:57.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
