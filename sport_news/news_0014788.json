Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 9:30 pm Mount Dora sends seniors off on winning note against Leesburg PAUL JENKINS paul.jenkins@dailycommercial.com dailycommercial.com | 0 comments \nMOUNT DORA – Thursday night was about saying goodbye for the five seniors on the Mount Dora High volleyball team. But it was also about a beginning as the Hurricanes wrapped up the regular season and began turning their thoughts to the postseason. \nMount Dora’s Brie Lemon, Courtney Randazzo, Sarah Cottle, Rowan Schwartz and Aracely Nunez brought their home careers to a close with a 25-7, 25-7, 25-12 win over Leesburg, the third straight 3-0 sweep for the Hurricanes. \nLemon led the way with 12 kills and four aces while Cottle added seven aces and nine kills, Randazzo had five kills and two aces and Rachel Clark had 23 assists, five aces, three kills and seven digs. \n“It was an honor playing with these girls,” said Lemon, who will continue her volleyball career next year at MIT. “Hopefully we can make it to state. We can see it. We’ve got good team chemistry and that’s something that is hard to come by.” \nMount Dora (19-4) wasn’t tested much by Leesburg, opening a 10-1 lead in the first game as Lemon had her best game of the night. In the second game it was Cottle’s turn to dominate, serving 15 straight points as the Hurricanes turned a 5-4 game into a 21-4 lead. \n“We’re real excited about the postseason,” Cottle said. “We knew coming into the year that we had a lot of potential and we’ve really come a long way in just a few months. We’ve grown tremendously.” \nMount Dora used a 6-0 run to take a 15-5 lead in the third game. The game got a little sloppy as it drew near a close and the Hurricanes knew their time on their home court was almost over. But Cottle put an emphatic finish to that with two straight kills to close out the match. \n“We’ve had a great season and we’ve shown the district what we can do,” Mount Dora coach Caryn Goldstein said. “I think they know what they need to do now and this is what they’ve trained for. This team really is a family and it’s a close-knit group of girls. They’ve got one more big dream here and we believe we’re going to do it.” \nThe match continued what has been a tough year for the Yellow Jackets in compiling a 1-14 record this season. \n“It’s been a struggle and a rebuilding year,” Leesburg coach Kris Durham said. “We’ve only got three seniors and only two of them had ever played for Leesburg before. We had a few injuries and four games into the season we lost our star player when she transferred.” \nDurham stepped into the breach for a second season when Leesburg didn’t have a volleyball coach but says this is the last time for that. \n“I only did it so the team could play,” Durham said. “This is a fairly young team but the girls have continued to do their best and they’ve continued to fight hard.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:28:14.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
