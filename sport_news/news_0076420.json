After being rained out for the last several years, 78 cars took to the track in hopes of dialing in their modifieds and getting ready for Thursday's time-trial sessions.\nBilly Decker, who hasn't won the 200-lap race at Syracuse since 2005, was the fastest with a surprising lap of 31.478 seconds at an average speed of 114.36 miles an hour.\n\"I like being at the top of the board but I don't think anybody is really laying it on the line yet,\" Decker said. \"I know a 31.4 is harder than I really wanted to run. We'll see how it shakes out tomorrow.\"\nAnd with so many cars on the track the clay surface ran in quickly and the groove widened, letting the teams do a little side-by-side racing to help get them comfortable with the mile track and their race cars.\n\"It's not too bad, typical,\" Decker said about the surface he ran on. \"Actually it came around a little quicker than I expected but it's typical of Syracuse early in the week.\"\nDecker's teammate Larry Wight was second fastest just two tenths of a second behind.\nRubber hits the road at Super DIRT Week There were two hours devoted to practice laps at the Syracuse Mile for the big-block modifieds at the fairgrounds.\n\"We ended up showing up a little bit after 4 o'clock, got in the car, got out and ran it,\" Wight said. \"I guess that's all we got for today but I think we definitely got something we can work with.\"\nHe was also happy with the early conditions he saw on Wednesday.\n\"Track is actually not bad,\" Wight said. \"It's got a little bit of a cushion where it's dirty but it's smooth all the way around and I think it's something we can work with this week.\"\nSix cars ran laps under 32 seconds with 2013 winner Billy Dunn turning in the third fastest lap. It was the first time in over five years that the Wednesday practice session happened with rainouts canceling past practices. Pennsylvania's Rick Laubach was the first car to turn a lap at the final Super DIRT Week on the mile.\nThursday is time trial day as big-block and small-block modifieds will lock in their top six positions for the races this weekend. Friday is the qualifying heat races and with the forecast not looking very good Thursday's time trials could set the field if Friday does rain out.\nCars dressed to impress One trend on Wednesday was throw back-paint schemes. Several teams went all out to honor the past for this final race on the historic mile track including Justin Haers, Matt Sheppard, Jimmy Phelps and Pat Ward.\nPat Ward is driving a car that looks just like the old Flyin' 42 his dad Bud drove in the mid 70s. Car owner Larry Wight wanted to surprise Ward and kept his plan a secret until he got it back from the graphics shop.\n\"I always wanted to do it for him. Everyone got on this retro kick so I figured it was the perfect time to do it,\" Wight said. \"I was the only one who knew. He was really excited and I got the reaction I was looking for.\"\n\"It was actually a big surprise to me. Lightning Larry got a bunch of pictures from Jennifer and took them up to our vinyl guy and brought it home with a big smile on his face,\" Ward said. \"He surprised the hell of out me. It brings tears to everyone's eyes who knew him well and a lot of people have come up and hugged me with tears in their eyes. He'd be really proud if he were alive to see this.\"\nThe wings that are on the side of the car were actually the idea that a 10-year-old Pat Ward had to make his dad's car special.\n\"I actually lettered that car for him out of stencils I cut out,\" Ward recalled. \"I cut a wing on a piece of cardboard and held it up there and traced it and painted it.\"\nWard's dad passed away last year.\nJustin Haers also wanted to pay tribute to his dad, Gerald, as he lettered up his car to look just like the cars his dad sponsored when Justin was a kid.\n\"For years my dad and my grandfather sponsored Billy Taylor, Doug Hoffman and numerous drivers from Sammy Swindell, Danny Johnson, Dave Blaney. The list goes on,\" Hears said. \"For here we did a little throw-back scheme, the old-school red number 1 and it's gotten a lot of attention. A lot of people love it. It's a real nice-looking car. It's a little thing remembering Doug Hoffman. It was an idea that we kind of threw around … it cost a little bit more money but memories you can never take away.\"\nMatt Sheppard surprised his dad Stu Sheppard with a car that looks like the one he drove when he moved up to the modified division\n\"I never knew a thing about it until two weeks ago,\" the elder Sheppard said. \"They surprised me with it. And I went to the shop and there it was. I was dumbfounded.\"\nHe also explained why it was the number 999.\n\"1990 was the year I ran that paint scheme. When I moved up to modifieds (Bob) McCreadie was 9, Charlie Donk was 99 so I went with triple 9's.\"\nJimmy Phelps channeled the old Troyer Mud Bus with a No. 6 car patterned after the car that Maynard Troyer built for former NASCAR racer Mike McLaughlin in 1983. That car was labeled experimental at the time and it was revolutionary in its design and results on the track making it a true part of dirt modified history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:32:24.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
