I’m looking forward to watching Liverpool play over the next few years.” \nRedknapp echoes the sentiment of most football pundits, who believe that Ancelotti will only take a job with a big, established club. \n“It’s got to be a big club for him, he’s a manager of Champions League clubs so he’s not going to take any job,” he said. \n“There are only five or six jobs he could take in the Premier League, so it’s very interesting to see what he’s got in mind.” \nAncelotti has experience managing Paris St. Germain, Real Madrid and Chelsea. \nPaul M.
