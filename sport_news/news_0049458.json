Before heading home, he took a side trip to Brandon with his son, Brad, to visit friends and family in the city that kept drawing him back throughout his hockey career. \n’s Wheat Kings in 1949. A year earlier he had left Canada at only 17 years old to play for the Falkirk Lions, one of a handful of Manitobans to suit up for the Scottish team. Almost immediately upon his return home, the young defenceman was approached by the Winnipeg Monarchs, but with next to no money put on the table by the team, Maxwell waited for a better offer to come his way; he got it shortly afterward when the Wheat Kings offered $300 a month for his services. Maxwell happily took them up on it and spent the next two seasons playing out of the old Wheat City Arena, winning the MJHL title in 1950. \nI really enjoyed that,\" Maxwell of his Cleveland stint. \"Johnny Bower was our goaltender and Freddy Shero was my defence partner. … I said to Johnny in practice, ‘How come you don’t let some goals in; we never know whether we’re any good or not.’ He said, ‘Max, when I put on these pads, it doesn’t matter if it’s practice or a real game, it’s always for keeps.’\" \nJuzda came out to hit me and I run my stick through his hair,\" Maxwell recalled. \"He says, ‘Max, I’m going to get you.’ I says, \"Juz, you’ll never get me, I’m too fast for you.’ About the next shift I’m coming down the other side of the ice and all of a sudden something hit me. I went down kind of in a sitting position and I was laughing to beat heck. … It was kind of payback.\" \n’60s, when the club was in the Western Canada Hockey League, which later became the WHL, but the team’s MJHL success wasn’t revived as he posted a 37-56-4 coaching record. \n’s heading to Minnesota to visit Brad, a former standout defenceman with the NHL’s North Stars. He devotes much of his time these days to his beloved golden retriever, Shelley. \n’s captain got word of his accomplishments and announced his presence to the passengers, drawing a rousing ovation — an act that was repeated later in the flight after a crew change. \nThat was the most enjoyable part of it was just the fun with all the people there understanding,\" Maxwell said. \"It kind of gave me kind of a thrill.\" \n’re on the topic of players who wore the black and gold for Brandon before the Wheat Kings’ WHL days, I got a note from former Brandon Sun managing editor Brian Marshall last month, shortly after the death of Tom Rice, the founder of financial and real estate company TJR and Associates and an avid hockey player in his younger days.
