Newton hosts Ballard Friday in Class 3A District 6 play. The Cardinals are 0-5 overall and 0-3 in district play. Caption (Jocelyn Sheets/Daily News) Scoring on every opportunity early and late is one of several key elments for Newton High’s Cardinals to break into the win column. By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nNewton High’s Cardinals — coaches and players — search for the right defense for the personnel on the 2015 football team. It has been tough with an 0-5 start and big plays by opponents’ offenses have plagued the Cardinal defensive unit. \n“We’ve got to find something which fits the personnel we have to work with and allows us not to give up those big plays. We, as coaches, will keep scratching to find a defense to help our kids be successful,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said after Friday’s loss to Gilbert. \nAfter falling behind 43-7 by halftime, the Cardinals controlled the second half with four touchdown drives, and a defensive goal-line stand. Gilbert did score late in the game for the final 50-34 margin. \nErgenbright said his team could build off what it did in the second half, both offensively and defensively. \nNewton hosts Ballard on Pink Out Friday in a Class 3A District 6 game. The Cardinals are 0-3 in district play. The Bombers come into H.A. Lynn Stadium at 2-3 overall and 1-1 in district. They lost 27-26 to Carlisle in a non-district game last week, scoring 20 points in the fourth quarter. \nKickoff is 7:30 p.m. for the varsity. The Cardinal freshmen take on Ballard at 4:45 p.m. \n“Consistency in your lineup is important, and we haven’t had that because of injuries. On defense, you work on a scheme to put players in position to make the plays. Going over film, we were close, but the teams got off those rapid-fire big plays,” Ergenbright said. \nGoing into Friday’s game, Ergenbright said the Cardinals will have similar personnel on defense as they had a week ago. One addition is the return of junior Reece Rosenquist, who has been sidelined since preseason practices, to the strong safety position. \n“We’ve focused this week on playing sound defense. Our kids have had great effort and attitudes in practices,” Ergenbright said. “Ballard runs a zone-ready offense and has a good running quarterback.” \nBallard has sophomore running back Hunter Wright and junior quarterback Max Stoltz leading the Bomber offense. Wright is the Bombers’ leading rusher — 98 carries for 587 yards with three touchdowns. Stoltz has run for 349 yards on 72 carries and scored five touchdowns. \nStoltz is 27-of-49 passing for 334 yards with four touchdown passes. Juniors Austin Edwards and Taylor Roberts are Ballard’s top receivers with 115 yards on eight catches and 110 yards on seven receptions, respectively. \n“We’re looking to have offensive drives much like the ones we had in the second half against Gilbert. We need to do that early in this game. We can’t fall behind again and play catch-up football,” Ergenbright said. “These kids have responded well to our situation. I’m happy with their effort and determination. It shows the character of our players.” \nIn their first two games of the season, the Cardinals rallied to tie the game, losing on a last-second field goal at Knoxville and a field goal in overtime by Marshalltown. Newton led 14-8 at halftime in game three against Grinnell, and then allowed 24 points in the third quarter. \nNewton and Benton were tied at 14-14 at the end of three quarters on a rainy and windy night. Benton broke open the game on a long touchdown run to open the fourth quarter. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:09:49.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
