Richardson started at left defensive tackle because the Jets opened the game with a 4-3 front, rather than their usual 3-4 base. In limited action, Richardson was credited with three tackles and a half-sack.\n\"I did all right,\" Richardson said of his day. \"I feel like when I wanted to, I got back there [to the quarterback] a couple times, a few times, actually. I just need to get my pass-rushing endurance back up, but other than that, I’m all right.\"\nThe 2013 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year said he felt like himself \"for the most part\" but added, \"sideline to sideline, [my] plays weren’t as consistent as I usually have [been], but other than that, it was good.\"\nCoach Todd Bowles said, \"He gave us some energy while he was in there. He still has to get in football shape. There were a couple of times where I left him in there a play too long, but overall, he did fine.\"\nBowles said he and defensive coordinator Kacy Rodgers used more 4-3 fronts, not so much to accommodate Richardson, but to try to slow down Washington’s rushing attack. The Redskins had 34 yards on 17 rushes.\nRichardson admitted he was \"just a little more anxious than usual. [It was] my first game back, so I was just happy to be out there.\"\nBriefs \nSlot CB Buster Skrine suffered a concussion and was replaced in that role by Dexter McDougle, who contributed a pass breakup. RB Bilal Powell exited with a sprained ankle. … FS Marcus Gilchrist had his second interception of the season. … The Jets committed only one penalty after having 14 infractions in their win over Miami in London two weeks ago. \"Our coaches harped on it,\" Bowles said. \"One penalty compared to 14 last game is an improvement.\" … Veteran RG Willie Colon, who missed the Miami game because of a knee injury, left the game in the second half with the Jets leading and was replaced by Brian Winters. Colon said he was taken out so he could get some rest.\n— J.P.
