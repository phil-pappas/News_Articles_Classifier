The event started in the late 1990s as part of the Take Back the Night movement, standing up to violence against women. The Bolingbrook rally now seeks to publicize abuse in all generations of the family, from elder to child abuse, as well as bullying.\nAt the rally, life-sized wooden cutouts — tall figures painted red for adults and short silhouettes colored white for children — wore cards telling stories of victims' deaths at the hands of family members and significant others.\nLeroy Brown, Bolingbrook deputy mayor, said he was part of the group of eight that organized the first march 17 years ago. He was proud of the way it has grown, and Thursday night rounded up the crowd for the flashlight march.\n\"My mother was involved in a very bad marriage. It was pretty violent,\" Brown said. \"We had to do something to let women know there is support.\"\nJames Glasgow, Will County state's attorney, stressed to the crowd the importance of raising money as state government funding dries up -- to keep helping domestic violence victims trying to escape a dangerous situation.\nImpact of domestic violence can last for generations, Kane Co. experts note Clifford Ward The impact of domestic violence can last well beyond the weeks an order of protection may be in force, or the months a convicted abuser may spend on probation, experts say.\nAt a media event on Tuesday, Kane County State's Attorney Joe McMahon and officials from two Kane County shelters said domestic...\nThe impact of domestic violence can last well beyond the weeks an order of protection may be in force, or the months a convicted abuser may spend on probation, experts say.\nAt a media event on Tuesday, Kane County State's Attorney Joe McMahon and officials from two Kane County shelters said domestic...\n(Clifford Ward) \"If we ask someone to walk away from a situation, how are they going to eat? Where are they going to live?\" Glasgow asked.\nIf a woman's life it wrapped up in that of her abuser's — which it often is, if the abuser is her husband — she will need help at first meeting those basic needs, he said.\nGlasgow suggested reaching out to landlords whose apartment complexes aren't full and other community members to help provide temporary housing and other support.\nRussell's daughter, Derriona Irons, 11, said she came out to help her teacher at Jane Addams Middle School in Bolingbrook.\nBut she and her friend, Kimora Haynes, 11, said they did learn a few things: \"Domestic violence is not nice,\" Irons said.\n\"We should speak up and say something,\" Haynes said.\nThe rally benefited Lamb's Fold Center for Women and Children in Joliet; Rebecca's House Foundation in Bolingbrook; and Girl Scouts of Greater Chicago and Northwest Indiana.\nCandlelight vigil highlights domestic violence in Arlington Heights Elizabeth Owens-Schiele Sylvia Smith still remembers the sound of her stepfather's footsteps in their Chicago apartment and the alcoholic wrath he could impart on her and her young siblings.\nFor almost 10 years, she and her mother were the main objects of his rage, she says, often showing bruises and black eyes inflicted...\nSylvia Smith still remembers the sound of her stepfather's footsteps in their Chicago apartment and the alcoholic wrath he could impart on her and her young siblings.\nFor almost 10 years, she and her mother were the main objects of his rage, she says, often showing bruises and black eyes inflicted...\n(Elizabeth Owens-Schiele) gbookwalter@tribpub.com\nTwitter: @genevievebook\n Bolingbrook", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615398f/turbine/ct-mcmahon-press-conference-met-1007-20151006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5618147d/turbine/ct-bol-bolingbrook-rally-domestic-violence-tl-1015-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612c15a/turbine/ct-arh-arlington-heights-domestic-violence-vigil-tl-1008-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:45:45.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
