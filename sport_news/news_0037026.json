That’s the margin of Balluzzo’s points lead following the most recent race, Sept. 19, which did not go well for either and included a display of anger under caution. \nBabb says that Balluzzo rammed him on a restart causing him to drop out of the lead. Balluzzo insists the contact was because “Babb did not go” on the restart, perhaps because of clutch problems, and resulted in part because another driver hit him from behind. \nShortly thereafter, Babb wrecked with Jon Largena in the second groove as they and Balluzzo, who was on the bottom, battled for the lead in Turn 1. Balluzzo's and Babb's cars did not touch during that incident. As the field sat parked under a red flag following the wreck, Babb drove his car into Balluzzo’s. \nBabb then parked in the pits because of damage to his frame from the wreck and finished 13th. Balluzzo, suffering from clutch damage unrelated to the hit from Babb, eventually dropped out and finished 12th. \nThat left them seven points apart going into the final race. Babb says his intention hitting Balluzzo under caution was to send a message, but adds it won’t carry over to Saturday. \n“If you’re asking me if I plan to retaliate (further), I don’t drive that way,” Babb said. “If I’m going to win the championship, I want to do it by out-driving him on the track.” \nBalluzzo doesn’t agree with Babb’s version of events and feels he has was not to blame in any way concerning Babb’s wreck with Largena. Balluzzo says further that Babb has purposely initiated contact with him throughout the season, at Langley and at East Carolina, where Balluzzo won the Modified title. \nBut Balluzzo has no plans to reignite a feud with Babb on Saturday, largely because the stakes are too high. Balluzzo needs only to finish seventh or better, if Babb wins, to claim his eighth Modified championship. That will be a new record among all divisions in Langley’s 65-year history. \n“At this point that would be really important, because my crew is all about that,” Balluzzo said of the eighth title, which would move him ahead of Late Model legend Phil Warren. “Robbie has the fastest car right now, but we’re the second fastest. \n“Unless we can run away from him then we’ll just fall in behind him if he’s faster.” \nOther championships \nChampionships in five other divisions will be decided on Saturday on the six-race card, which includes a Champ Kart 25, UCAR 25, Grand Stock 40, Super Truck 25 and Enduro 30. Jesse Jones IV (UCAR), Charlie-Ray Lorah (Kart) and Richard Quinn (Enduro) have virtually wrapped up titles in their divisions, but there are two close title races in addition to the Modifieds. \nIn Grand Stock, Mark Frye (286 points) holds a slim lead over Tommy Sweeney (282) and Jamie Sample (279). In Super Truck, Chase McAdams (170) will have to hold off Trevor Battoia (166) and Richard Ellis (165) to defend his title.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:48:11.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
