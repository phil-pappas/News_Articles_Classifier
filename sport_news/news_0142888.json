Indiana's five-game winning streak is the school's longest since 1987. Hoosiers fans have waited decades to prove they can compete with the Big Ten's best, and now they'll get a chance. \nKEY MATCHUP \nOhio State run defense vs. RB Jordan Howard. Howard leads the Big Ten in yards rushing (675), averages 6.1 yards per carry and has topped the 140-yard mark in each of his first four games with Indiana. Ohio State's usually stout defense is allowing 121.8 yards per game. If Howard runs wild, the Hoosiers may have a chance to pull the upset. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nOhio State: DL Joey Bosa. The 2014 All-American and Big Ten defensive player of the year is averaging 4.3 tackles per game and has just half a sack after missing the opener due to a suspension. Ohio State could use Bosa to assert himself against a good offense. \nIndiana: Howard. The UAB transfer finished in the top 10 nationally last season in yards rushing per game and has been every bit as good in 2015. This could be his first, last and best chance to take advantage of the national stage. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nOhio State takes a 20-game winning streak in the series into Saturday. The Buckeyes have only lost twice to Indiana since 1952. ... The Hoosiers are 0-15 all-time against No. 1 teams including 0-5 against the Buckeyes when they hold the nation's top spot. ... Ohio State has won 14 straight road games and a Big Ten record 24 consecutive regular-season league games. ... Indiana is 4-0 for the first time since 1990. ... Buckeyes RB Ezekiel Elliott has nine straight 100-yard games. ... Indiana has outscored opponents 51-0 in the third quarter this season. \nAP Photo: Steve Helber \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
