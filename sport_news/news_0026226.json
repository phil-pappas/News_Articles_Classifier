His freshman year was productive, finishing with 40 tackles, three pass break-ups, three passes defensed and a forced fumble.\nOff that season, instead of moving full speed ahead, Leslie underwent offseason shoulder surgery, which cost him all of the winter, all of spring practice, and forced him to play catchup as training camp began in August.\n“It was a little frustrating, but with time, it all worked out,” Leslie said. “I think it took some time to get used to hitting with my shoulder again. As time went on, things got better. It was all mental. I knew the shoulder was alright, but everyone is playing so fast, so you can’t be hesitant out here.”\n“As we started the season, I think there was a bit of frustration in Marcus because he was a starter through most of last season,” Monmouth head coach Kevin Callahan said. “It was a little slow starting during fall camp. Not that he was doing poorly, but he wasn’t quite back to being himself. To his credit, he kept working hard at it, he got an opportunity to go in and he played pretty well last week.”\nLeslie has seen action in all five games during Monmouth’s 2-3 start, but his first start of the season in the Hawks’ 31-24 win over Bryant was his best showing yet. Looking fit and at full-health, he finished with four tackles and was rarely thrown at by Bulldogs quarterback Dalton Easton as the game wound down.\nHis play on special teams was also a major point of emphasis Saturday. After Leslie raced to down a Matt White punt at the Bryant 1, Big South Defensive Player of the Week John Sieczkowski picked off Easton and returned it five yards for a touchdown and a 24-16 Hawks lead with 11:32 to play in the game.\n“The one thing for him is, he never really withdrew,” Callahan said. “He stayed engaged with the team, he stayed in everything we were doing and he was always around. It was just a matter of getting himself ready to get back on the field and compete. It just took him a little while to get back to playing at the level he was.”\n“Last week went well, but there’s always things to improve upon,” Leslie said. “Each day, you come out here to get better and that’s what I’m trying to do. I just want to get better every day.”\nAfter getting his first start last week, Leslie appears as a starter for the first time on Monmouth’s latest depth chart, which was released on Wednesday. The Hawks open Big South play on Saturday at Charleston Southern, which registered a 27-0 win last season in West Long Branch that was marred by a torrential downpour throughout.\nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman4@gannettnj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:30:12.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
