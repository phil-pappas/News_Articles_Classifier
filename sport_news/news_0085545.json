The Fox Cities is rich in resources when it comes to catering to the running crowd. \nOne of those resources, the retailer Run Away Shoes, is launching two new 10K runs. The Houdini 10K, set to debut Nov. 7 in downtown Appleton, and the Badger State 10K, set for April 2 at a site to be determined in Green Bay, are designed to become annual events that bookend the running season. \n“We wanted to do a duo 10K,” said Claire Koepp, internal director for Run Away Shoes, which operates stores in Appleton, Green Bay and Oshkosh. “We wanted to do one that will start the new year and one that will end the year. We wanted it to be something different.” \nThe Houdini 10K run finsher's medal. (Photo: Courtesy of Houdini 10K) \nCount me in. I already signed up for the Houdini 10K, a race that will begin in Houdini Plaza in Appleton’s downtown and loop through the city’s south side before ending at the Houdini’s Escape Gastropub on South Oneida Street. Houdini to Houdini, with a beer chaser at the end. I mean, how cool is that? \nThe Fox Valley is flush with 5K runs. And the marathons and half marathons in the Fox Cities and Green Bay draw plenty of attention. But other than Green Bay’s Bellin Run, there’s been a dearth of 10Ks in the neighborhood. \n“There just aren’t that many 10Ks out there,” Koepp said. “But it’s a great distance.” \nRegistration will be capped at 650 for each race. The Houdini 10K is about 60 percent full, Koepp said. \n“We stayed at that number because it’s a first-time event,” she said. “We wanted to keep it modest the first time so we make sure we do it right. Hopefully there will be a lot of interest and then we can grow from there.” Buy Photo Runners make their way through the start as the Community First Fox Cities Marathon gets underway in Menasha, Wis., Sunday, September 20, 2015.
