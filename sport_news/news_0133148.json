It’s over.\nIt was riotous and reckless and almost lost in maddening fashion, but the Blue Jays won the winner-take-all series finale against the Texas Rangers 6-3 on Wednesday and will now advance to the American League Championship Series. The game will be remembered as historically strange.\nWith the Jays playing under protest after the Rangers scored a bizarre go-ahead run in the top of the seventh, Jose Bautista nearly blew the roof off the closed dome by hitting a game-breaking, three-run homer that sent the already hyper-charged and aggressive Rogers Centre crowd into an even bigger frenzy.\nThe blast, sent into the second deck in left field, came after the Rangers made three straight errors to load the bases with none out in the seventh. The Rangers were clearly rattled after all hell broke loose in the top half of the inning following a strange sequence of events.\nWith the teams tied at two and the Rangers’ Rougned Odor at third base, Jays’ catcher Russell Martin’s throw back to pitcher Aaron Sanchez ricocheted off the bat of Shin-Soo Choo. Odor scored on the play, but prior to him touching the plate home-plate umpire Dale Scott appeared to have clearly called time.\nBut Rangers’ manager Jeff Banister asked Scott to confer with the rest of the umpiring crew, after which they decided to count the run. Mayhem ensued, as frustrated fans started raining beer cans and other debris onto the field. The play was then reviewed by instant replay, but the call stood.\nMajor League Baseball’s rules state that “if the batter is standing in the batter’s box and he or his bat is struck by the catcher’s throw back to the pitcher and, in the umpire’s judgment, there is no intent on the part of the batter to interfere with the throw, the ball is alive and in play.”\nThe complicating factor, of course, was Scott’s calling of time.\nEither way, the crowd was bloodthirsty by that point, fearing the season would end in such flimsy fashion. When play eventually resumed, the Rangers returned twitchy and tense.\nAfter Bautista’s homer, which the brazen slugger celebrated with a flamboyant bat flip, the roiling tension boiled over. The benches cleared twice and it felt as if the game needed a release valve.\nThe sold out crowd of nearly 50,000 had already been slightly edgy to that point, with the Rangers taking an early lead and their ace left-hander Cole Hamels dealing on the mound. The crowd was urgent and anticipatory, but nervy, too.\nThen Edwin Encarnacion tied the game in the sixth inning with his own no-doubt homer off the facing of the upper deck.\nThe Rangers had been trying to avoid Encarnacion all series, intentionally walking him three times — a Jays’ postseason record — before his sixth-inning homer.\nThe Jays are now just third team in baseball history to come back to win a five-game series after losing the first two games at home. They will play either the Kansas City Royals, the defending league champs, or the Houston Astros, who play their deciding Game 5 Wednesday night.\nPrior to the chaotic seventh, it looked as if Hamels’ veteran experience would trump Marcus Stroman’s youthful exuberance.\nBut Stroman hung in and the Jays played fantastic defence behind him.\nRussell Martin, who led all American League catchers by throwing out more than 44 per cent of baserunners, gunned down Elvis Andrus trying to steal third in the second. Kevin Pillar stole a bloop hit from Josh Hamilton in the fourth, running forever before diving headlong to make the catch, leaving a literal skid mark in shallow left-centre. Ryan Goins helped Stroman out of the sixth with a slick, sliding snag on Elvis Andrus’ sharp grounder up the middle. Josh Donaldson barehanded a DeShields’ chopper in the seventh.\nThat allowed the Jays to win it with the long ball.\nIt was just a few days ago that all the season’s good vibes looked like they may have been extinguished. But then they went to Texas and regained their old form.\nAfter winning three straight must-win games, the Jays — and their fans — get a much-needed breather.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays playing under protest after controversial call in ALDS Game 5\nFans recall their favourite Blue Jays moments from the series (so far)", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:57:15.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
