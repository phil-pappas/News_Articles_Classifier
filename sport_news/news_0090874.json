The impact he ended up making as a rookie was measurable -- and immeasurable. \nHis coaches and teammates were so impressed that they voted him the 2015 Willie Mac Award winner -- the first time in its 35-year history that the honor went to a rookie. \nDuffy stood on the field alongside former winners including Jack Clark, Darrell Evans, J.T. Snow, Bengie Molina and Shawon Dunston -- and Willie McCovey, of course -- and thanked his family, coaches, teammates and \"all the coaches who taught me how to play the game the right way. They taught me if you put in the time and preparation, good things will come.\" \nDespite never playing a game at Triple-A, Duffy made such an impact as a late-season call-up last season that manager Bruce Bochy was determined to break camp with him on the roster. Duffy continued to make the most of every opportunity, and took over as the everyday third baseman when the Giants designated Casey McGehee for assignment in May. \nDuffy entered Friday hitting .298/.337/.433 with 12 home runs and 76 RBIs -- the most by a Giants rookie since Chili Davis in 1982. And stunning as it might be, his streak of 115 consecutive games played (76 starts) already ranks as the third longest among active major leaguers, behind Baltimore's Manny Machado (159) and the Angels' Kole Calhoun (150). Advertisement \nDuffy's 89 hits since the All-Star break are the most among all National League players. And his 46 extra-base hits are three more than Buster Posey amassed in 2010 on his way to the N.L. Rookie of the Year award. \nIt is unlikely that Duffy will win that honor, given the season Kris Bryant is having with the Chicago Cubs. But Duffy should appear on most if not all ballots. \nDuffy becomes the sixth player on the current roster to win the Willie Mac Award -- an indication that the Giants tend to keep the players they value most. Posey, Matt Cain, Ryan Vogelsong, Hunter Pence and Madison Bumgarner are other recipients. \nDuffy concluded his brief remarks by thanking Giants fans. \n\"The energy you bring to the park is unbelievable,\" he said. \"This award means a lot to me, and I can't thank you enough.\" For more on the Giants, see the Giants Extra blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/Giants .
