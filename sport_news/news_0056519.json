The game was tied at halftime before the Hawks scored 35 unanswered points. “You really have to approach each week the same,” Huntingdon head coach Mike Turk said. “We’re really focused on what we need to do.” The Hawks racked up 556 total yards with 396 coming on the ground. Huntingdon forced three turnovers and allowed just 110 passing yards. \n2 Momentum shift: In last year’s meeting, Huntingdon led 17-10 with 5:14 left in the fourth quarter when punter Parker Allen fumbled a snap which was returned by LaGrange for a touchdown. The Panthers went on to win 24-17. “The last few losses we’ve had have all been the same way,” Turk said. “Those games have always come down to the end, and we hadn’t been able to come up with the big play.” \n3 Nothing but air : LaGrange has put all its stock into sophomore quarterback Connor Blair. Blair has thrown for 1,389 yards and 10 touchdowns in the Panthers’ four games so far this season. “Getting to the quarterback is very important against this team,” senior defensive lineman Heath McCray said. “We’ve got older guys on defense, and we’ve better against the pass, so there’s a lot of confidence with this unit.” \n4 Good and bad: Heading into Saturday’s action, only two teams in the USA South have a .500 or better overall record. Huntingdon and Maryville (Tenn.) are each 4-1. LaGrange started the season 0-3 before a 27-25 victory over Greensboro last Saturday. “Lots of teams have been throwing stuff at us that we haven’t seen,” senior offensive lineman Brandon Rockett said. “We’ve been able to adjust on the fly, and that’s been a huge part of our success this year.” \nPLAYER OF THE WEEK \nAnthony White \nDB, Sr., 5-10, 187 \nWhite made a triumphant return from a torn meniscus last week against Ferrum, tying a school record with three interceptions in the Hawks’ 56-21 win last Saturday. \nPREDICTION \nIt’s a huge game for the Hawks, who have been victimized by one-possession losses to the Panthers each of the last two seasons. This time, Coach Turk will celebrate his 51st birthday on Sunday following a hard-fought victory. Huntingdon 30, LaGrange 20. \nTHE GAME \nWHERE : Callaway Stadium, LaGrange, Ga. \nRECORDS : Huntingdon (4-1, 2-0 USA South); LaGrange (1-3, 1-0) \nON THE AIR: Internet: www.huntingdonhawks.com \nTWITTER: @mgmsports \nBY THE NUMBERS \n185 : Hawks running back Jay Ware rushed for 185 yards in last year’s meeting.
