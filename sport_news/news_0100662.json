DeSean Jackson has a chance to back up his tough talk. During training camp, the Washington wide receiver had an eye-opening boast.\n“I don’t think no one can guard me,” Jackson said. “It’s how I feel about myself. I don’t feel no one can stop me. You can get Darrelle Revis, Richard Sherman — whoever you want to get.”\nJackson hasn’t had an opportunity to flash his ability this year, sidelined almost the entire season with a hamstring injury. He may be able to make his return against the Jets — and Revis.\n“He’s confident, man. He’s a confident player and that’s how he feels,” Revis said Monday when asked about Jackson’s comments. “That’s his opinion.”\nAsked if he hopes Jackson plays, Revis said, “I think for us as a defense, we want to play against the best.”\nRevis and Jackson have squared off twice before. In 2011, Jackson was held to just two receptions for 28 yards against the Jets, though the Eagles won 45-19. In 2013, Jackson prevailed over Revis’ Bucs, catching six passes for 64 yards and two touchdowns in another Eagles win. However, Revis only surrendered two passes for six yards (neither for a score) to Jackson in that game, according to ProFootballFocus.com.\n“He makes plays,” Revis said. “On defense we make plays as well.”\nRIB EYE\nJets fans got a brief scare on Monday when Todd Bowles revealed that Muhammad Wilkerson had sore ribs that required an X-ray. However, Wilkerson’s ribs are fine, the X-ray coming back negative, according to sources.\nBowles indicated that Wilkerson was injured in the team’s Oct. 4 game against the Dolphins, but the coach only learned of it on Monday. Wilkerson was limited in Monday’s practice.\nThough coming off the bye week, the team is still dealing with quite a few injuries. Willie Colon (knee), David Harris (quad), Bilal Powell (groin), Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee), Jamari Lattimore (concussion) and Chris Owusu (knee) didn’t practice. Jeff Cumberland (concussion) practiced in a red non-contact jersey. Marcus Williams strained his hamstring during practice. ... To make room for Sheldon Richardson, the Jets waived TE Wes Saxton on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:20:29.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
