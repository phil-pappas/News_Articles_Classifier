Along with finishing third in the meet, which is the highest finish for the Boonville girls cross-country team, the Lady Pirates also had one of their highest finishes for a female participant as sophomore Kaylee Lang placed seventh out of 38 runners in a time of 23:39. In the final-team standings for the girls, Moberly captured first with a total of 17 points while Mexico finished second with 61 points, Boonville third with 81 points, Hannibal fourth with 95 points and Fulton fifth with 100 points. Kirksville and Marshall both had incomplete teams. As for the best overall time for the girls, Allison Aleshire of Moberly captured first in a time of 21:23. Sophomore Blake Allison also turned in a solid performance for the Lady Pirates by finishing in 16th place in a time of 25:22 while Grace Schupp placed 17th overall in 25:30, Maddie Weber 27th in 27:03 and Patience Dorman 29th in 27:30. As for the Boonville boys cross-country team, they failed to score as a team while needing the required five runners. The Pirates had only four runners for the conference meet. As for the final-team standings for the boys, Hannibal captured first with 34 points while Mexico finished second with 56 points, Fulton third with 58 points, Kirksville fourth with 98 points and Marshall fifth with 134 points. Moberly also had an incomplete team. As for the top runner in the meet, Malik Holman of Mexico turned in the fastest time in 16:59. For the Boonville boys cross-country team, Jason Broyhill finished 25th out of 42 runners in a time of 20:53 while Charlie Pumel took 27th in 21:00, Zac Ruffolo 33rd in 21:54 and Austin Wray in 37th place in 22:31. Boonville Cross-Country Coach Blake Bodenhamer said both teams had pretty solid performances at the conference meet. “The course had a good combination of steep hills and flat areas,”Bodenhamer said. “Jason Broyhill, Charlie Pumel, and Zac Ruffolo all performed very well. The three placed in the middle of the pack against some pretty competitive teams which I was proud of. Austin Wray came back this meet after having been out due to a hip injury. Wray ran a decent time taking into account that he has been out for the last couple of weeks. I thought that the girls really shined in this meet. Kaylee Lang ended up placing seventh in the girls division, earning herself a medal and an all-conference title. Lang continues to be one of our most powerful assets on the girls side of things. Blake Allison and Grace Schupp were just on the cusp of receiving the all-conference title, placing 16th and 17th respectively.” The Boonville Pirates cross-country team will have two weeks to prepare for the Class 3 District 5 Meet on Saturday, Oct. 31st at Howard Hills Athletic Complex in Moberly. Page 2 of 2 - Teams competing in the meet along with Boonville are: Clinton, Eldon, Helias, Kirksville, Marshall, Moberly, Odessa, Osage, Southern Boone, Versailles and Warrensburg.
