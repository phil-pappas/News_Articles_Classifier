All five defensemen.” \nFive minutes into the game, the Mavericks lost their captain, junior Carter Foguth, an all-situations, minutes-eating defenseman, to a unpenalized late hit to the head, putting more burden on Jutzi, an assistant captain and Foguth's defensive partner, and others. \n“You need your leadership group to step up,” coach Mike Hastings said. “First we lose our captain to a hit, and then you need some other leaders to step up. I thought Jon Jutzi went above and beyond — really the whole group of five.” \nThe group also included veterans Casey Nelson and Sean Flanagan, as well less-experienced sophomore Jaden Schmeisser and freshman Daniel Brickley. \n\"I think it says a lot about their feelings for Fogie, stepping up the way they did,\" Hastings said. \nZach Stepan made two of the game's prettiest plays for a goal and an assist for the Mavericks, and C.J. Franklin scored the other goal. Goalie Cole Huggins, who did not play in the series opener, finished with 27 saves. \nMinnesota State was outshot 29-21. \n“It’s the sign of a good team to find a way to win, especially on the road in this building,” said Jutzi, who finished plus-1 with four blocked shots. “We were able to do it twice this weekend.” \nOn the game-winner, Jutzi snuck down the weak side and was wide open on the back door when Stepan, near the opposite post, threaded a perfect pass through the slot for the easy tap-in. Looking like he was taking a shot, Stepan held the puck just a bit longer and got it across. \n“He was screaming, calling for it,” Stepan said. “I just had to figure out how to get it through.” \nIt was the fifth career goal for Jutzi and his first game-winner. \nStepan gave the Mavericks a 2-1 lead with 2:46 remaining in the first period, intercepting a Beavers defensive-zone pass and turning into a pretty breakaway goal. He got goalie Michael Bitzer to bite on a fake and put the backhanded shot under the crossbar. \n“Stepan played all over; he played lot of minutes,” Hastings said. “He was responsible, creative. I thought his game was filled with substance tonight, and he was rewarded for that.” \nStepan’s goal came just 24 seconds after Franklin’s power-play goal, a cross-crease pass that went in off a defenseman’s skate. \nEach team scored two power-play goals. \nBemidji State got the scoring started on Gerry Fitzgerald’s blast from the left circle at 15:51 of the first period. Graeme McCormick tied the game at 2-2 with a 5-on-3 power-play goal with 2:51 left in the second period. \nThe sweep was Minnesota State's first in Bemidji since the 2009-10 season, the year before the Sanford Center opened. They had split their previous three series in the new arena. \nThe Mavericks (2-4-0, 2-0-0 in WCHA) will return to Mankato where they will host Alaska on Friday and Saturday. \nFollow Shane Frederick on Twitter @puckato  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:27:39.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
