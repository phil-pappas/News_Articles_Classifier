They have been wonderful against USA and Chile, especially against the hosts â€“ a game many people said will be very tough. \n\"But they should not be carried away by their success so far in this U17 World Cup because that was what happened to us at the last U20 World Cup. \n\"We were confident we could beat our opponents but found some of these teams extremely difficult,\" the Enyimba midfielder who has been a regular in the national U23 Eagles games further told Completesportsnigeria.com . \nSokari however expressed hope that the Eaglets will defend the title they won in 2013. \n\"They are working with a good coach, an ex international who played football to the highest level and was a one-time African Footballer of the Year, so I believe they have the ability to defend the title again,\" Sokari enthused. \nThe Eaglets will play against Croatia in their last Group A game midnight on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:10:15.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
