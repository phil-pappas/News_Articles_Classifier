The team announced prior to its 3-1 season-ending loss to Cleveland on Sunday that John Farrell will return as manager in 2016 \"provided (he is given) a clean bill of health.\" Furthermore, the Red Sox reached an agreement on a two-year contract with interim manager Torey Lovullo to return to his role as bench coach. As part of the deal, Lovullo waived his right to pursue managerial vacancies this offseason. The contracts for both Farrell and Lovullo run through 2017, though Farrell's contains an option for 2018. The Red Sox and new president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski have again voted for continuity. Dombrowski went that route when he promoted Mike Hazen to general manager earlier this month, and he is sticking with a manager he has yet to watch preside over a game since his own hiring in August. \"The reality is, I haven't had a chance to evaluate John at all as a manager,\" Dombrowski said. \"He's managed successfully at the big-league level. It's hard to find established major-league managers that have won. I've talked to a lot of people that I trust. I look forward to working with him. I think he deserves that opportunity.\" \"We were all expecting that and hoping that. We just wanted John to be back to normal,\" said Dustin Pedroia. \"We can't wait to get him back.\" \"Everybody in here expected this to go the way it did,\" Clay Buchholz said. \"This is (Farrell's) club.\" Farrell is 372-390 as a big-league manager, including a 218-220 mark in three seasons with the Red Sox (excluding the games he has missed this season). Still, Farrell has yet to officially receive that clean bill of health that would allow him to return to the helm. Farrell completed his chemotherapy last week, and he's due for a checkup three weeks from now. Dombrowski said there's a chance it will take three to six months for Farrell to feel 100 percent. That's where Lovullo comes in. \"The commitment is made to John; he'll be our manager for 2016, and he should be fine,\" Dombrowski said. \"But I also want to make sure, how do we protect ourselves?\" Lovullo, who has steered the Red Sox to a 28-19 record as the interim manager, originally had one year left on his contract. Boston ripped that up and gave him a two-year deal through 2017 with a substantial raise — Dombrowski called it \"the upper echelon\" of bench coaches — to mitigate the fact that Lovullo will not manage elsewhere next season. \"I don't think he could have handled himself any better than what he has, not only running the club in John's absence but also always giving the proper authority to John and knowing it's John's team,\" Dombrowski said. \"He made that commitment to the organization. We've very thankful for what he has done.\" Page 2 of 2 - \"It was a difficult decision for me,\" said Lovullo, who took about 10 days to agree to terms after Dombrowski initially made the offer. \"It just felt right to be here, it just felt right to stay here, it just felt right to see this through. I have a love for the organization, I have a love for John, I have a love for the players.\" \"If something were to happen, my time is coming if it's meant to be.\" This is probably the best-case scenario for the Red Sox. Despite poor results the last two seasons, Farrell has a track record of major-league success and the respect of his clubhouse. Letting him go as he battled Stage 1 lymphoma would have been about as bad a public-relations move as possible for an organization. Keeping Lovullo in-house gives Boston an excellent backup plan should Farrell's health deteriorate or should the team struggle again in 2016. However, this still isn't a perfect scenario, and there's bound to be some level of awkwardness between Farrell and Lovullo next season. The Red Sox are in a win-now position, and another slow start in 2016 will ramp up speculation about Farrell's job, especially with an obvious candidate-in-waiting next to him on the bench. Dombrowski downplayed that dynamic. \"He's John's guy. He's his closest confidant,\" Dombrowski said of Lovullo. \"I can't think of a situation where (Farrell) would be more comfortable with someone.\" \"I haven't quite gone there, nor can I worry about it,\" said Lovullo. \"In this game, you can't spend time worrying about all that.\" Dombrowski largely maintained the status quo. Almost the entire coaching staff will be back, with the exception of first-base coach Arnie Beyeler and strength and conditioning coach Pat Sandora. That reflects a faith in the personnel he inherited, both on the field and in the front office. \"The foundation and the consistency that's been built here remains here, and that's important,\" \"I'm happy for all of us that things have fallen into place,\" Lovullo said. \"It's just getting us one step closer to where we need to get to next year.\" By Tim Britton Providence Journal The Bulletin By Tim Britton Providence Journal Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 9:03 PM Updated at 9:46 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:27:20.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
