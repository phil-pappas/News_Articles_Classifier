The facility boasts virtual reality batting coaching in its cages, where players can select to \"hit\" in any MLB or college baseball stadium in the nation.\n\"Before we started and before we were getting to use MVP we had boys who weren't even able to make contact with the baseball consistently. They couldn't catch they couldn't throw, and since then they've become very competitive, they're just driving shots into the outfield,\" Potter said.\nQuinn said a group of fathers chose to open the facility due to lack of places to train their children's teams.\n\"We'll have thousands of people coming into the area. for our tournaments, for our leagues, for our hitting instruction, so this facility will hopefully be a magnet and benefit, really, the entire community here in Galena,\" Quinn said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:25:12.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
