The spokesman said Sharif termed the Kashmir issue as the unfinished agenda of the creation of Pakistan and contended that friendly relations between New Delhi and Islamabad without resolving Kashmir would be nothing but \"self deceit\". \"In the letter, Sharif has said Kashmir is not a border dispute but concerns 'right to self-determination' of two crore people. He also said Pakistan has made it clear to India that there can be no progress on bilateral ties while ignoring Kashmir issue,\" the spokesman claimed. Sharif also said that the National Security Adviser-level talks between the two countries could not take place as \"India was not ready to talk Kashmir issue\". \"We want good relations with all our neighbours including India but New Delhi's unrealistic approach has been a big impediment,\" the spokesman Quote: d the Pakistan Prime Minister having said in the letter. The spokesman said Geelani has in principle accepted the invitation to visit Pakistan.
