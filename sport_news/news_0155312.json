Pleasant News \nDAVENPORT — The Mt. Pleasant junior varsity football team had their three-game winning streak snapped on Monday against Davenport Assumption, 54-13, one week after moving to 3-0 with a 26-0 win over Chariton. \nAgainst Chariton, the defense picked off three passes, one each by Colin Mulford, Reece McNamee and Keegan Rich, and stopped the Chargers from scraping together any points. \nThe first two touchdowns of the game were big plays from the defense and special teams. Jake Lowe ran back a 57-yard punt return for a touchdown, and Mulford’s interception went 80 yards for a pick-six. \nWith the score at 13-0, Damien Lorenzo caught a 44-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Zac Beason, and Mulford scored his second touchdown on a 10-yard reception that helped bring the score to 26-0. \nOffense was tough to come by against a talented Assumption team, but Beason did throw for 356 yards and two scores in the 54-13 loss. Reece McNamee, who also picked off a pass during the game, caught a 70-yard pass for a touchdown to open up the scoring, and Lorenzo caught one for 65 yards. \nLeading tacklers against Assumption were Dalton Bass (nine tackles, two assists), Caleb Potts (eight tackles) and Luke VanNyhuis (six tackles). \nThe JV Panthers will be back at home this Monday, Oct. 5, when they take on Clear Creek-Amana at 5:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:31:00.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
