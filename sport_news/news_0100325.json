They ran split-safety zone coverage, which Patriots receiver Julian Edelman beat by feigning a corner route and then breaking inside.\n“The ball was out. Tom anticipated it,” Jets safety Dion Bailey told USA TODAY Sports. “By the time (Edelman) crossed my face, the ball was already right there for him. As soon as I flipped my head, he was already catching the ball.”\nBOX SCORE: PATRIOTS 30, JETS 23\nThe 27-yard completion propelled the Patriots’ go-ahead drive in a 30-23 triumph at Gillette Stadium that kept them unbeaten, opened a two-game lead over the Jets in the AFC East standings and reaffirmed Brady as a leading candidate for his third NFL MVP award.\nAfter an offseason tour through an NFL investigation and the federal court system, Brady is on pace to match the single-season record for passing yards (5,477 by Peyton Manning in 2013). And numbers like he put up Sunday – 34-of-54 passing for 355 yards and two touchdowns – don’t come close to telling the story.\nThe Patriots entered Sunday with a heavily depleted offensive line, their leading rusher (Dion Lewis) inactive because of an abdominal injury and no plans to present even the pretense of a running game against the NFL’s top-ranked defense. They endured a series of drops by newly active Brandon LaFell and a big one by Edelman on third-and-goal.\nYet there was Brady, repeatedly identifying Jets coach Todd Bowles’ blitzes down the stretch and exploiting weak spots such as Bailey – a second-year pro cut last month by the Seattle Seahawks who was on in place of the injured Calvin Pryor – overplaying Edelman’s outside stem with the Jets leading 20-16 and less than 11 minutes to go.\n“I was kind of reading Jules, and then Jules broke across his body and (I) let it go,” Brady said. “… It’s not exactly how we drew it up.”\nBut that’s sort of how the Patriots’ offense works. As Bailey put it: “Every route, they have options to do whatever they want pretty much to get open.”\nWATCH: Patriots-Jets highlights\nBrady, 38, is so in command and so trusts the likes of Edelman and Danny Amendola to read defenses the same way he does they can control middle of the field together. Send as much pressure as Bowles did, and Brady eventually will exploit that, too.\nMinutes after Brady gave the Patriots the lead with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Amendola, he all but sealed the decision with a 15-yard touchdown to tight end Rob Gronkowski, who shadow blocked Jets linebacker Quinton Coples before slipping out uncovered.\n“I was in pass protection a lot. (The Jets ran) a lot of blitz-zero,” Gronkowski said. “Just throughout the game, just saw they were coming with my guy that had me man (to man) and just leaked out there in the end, leaked out in the flat. Tom saw it and it was just a good play.”\nThose types of strikes will suck the life out of any foe, even one as talented all around as the Jets, who put up a good fight Sunday even though running back Chris Ivory was battling hamstring trouble and Brandon Marshall dropped what would’ve been a 12-yard touchdown to put the Jets up eight before Brady went to work.\n“Tom is great at dissecting any defense, and that’s what he did down the stretch,” said Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis, who played on the Patriots’ title team last season. “He ended up making more plays that us. He ended up finding the matchups that he wanted to find and made the plays he needed to make.”\nSaid Jets linebacker Calvin Pace: “That’s why one day that guy will be in Canton, man.”\nAt this rate, Brady and the Patriots may be in Santa Clara, Calif., for Super Bowl 50, too – though for now the focus turns to another division game Thursday against the surging Miami Dolphins, who will see plenty of reminders on tape of what they’re in for.\nGive Brady anything, and he’ll take it all.\nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmmYmG.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://www.twitter.com/TomPelissero", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmqz8W.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Perfect", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Is", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Pats", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfC41d.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Do", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmkw06.img&quot;}}", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:55:25.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
