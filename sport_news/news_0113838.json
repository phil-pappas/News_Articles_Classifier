(Elsa/Getty Images) \nThe Mets very well may become National League champions, possibly as soon as Wednesday night, if they win Game 4 of the NLCS against the Cubs. But as of Wednesday afternoon, all the team had was a 3-0 lead in the series — a commanding position to be sure, but a guarantee of nothing ( as the 2004 Yankees could tell their neighbors ). \nNevertheless, hours before the first pitch of Game 4, visitors to the Mets’ official Web site were presented with a startling sight: merchandise celebrating New York’s capture of the pennant. @AdamRubinESPN This popped up on the #Mets website.

GO CUBS!!! https://t.co/GPfiQFzwDQ pic.twitter.com/I4bdO1UQ6G \n— ABC 7 Chicago (@ABC7Chicago) October 21, 2015 \nThere was some speculation that, on “Back to the Future Day,” someone in the Mets’ organization actually had gotten his or her hands on a sports almanac printed (yeah, right) years from now, indicating that the team really had won the 2015 pennant. But, no, it was just a mistake. \nFrom a report by the New York Daily News : \nBob Bowman, the CEO of MLB Advanced Media, told the News Wednesday the mistake was on them, not the Mets. \n“We run all the websites, someone obviously, despite all processes, pushed the wrong button. We deeply apologize.” \nSo there you have it, just an honest mistake. OR … was it the work of a Cubs fan secretly trying to place on all-time jinx on the Mets?! No, probably just a mistake. \nA mistake, though, that will loom large in Mets lore if the team somehow blows this thing. Des writes for the Early Lead and the D.C.
