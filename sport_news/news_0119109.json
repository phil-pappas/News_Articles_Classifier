They seem to do everything together, even fish.\" \nIt's on those fishing trips that the Cardinals' offensive line started becoming close and earning Langston's approval. \nThe Cardinals had to replace three starters along the front line including at center, where sophomore Matthew Oubre , a transfer from Louisiana-Monroe, has filled in admirably. \nOubre arrived in the spring, when the fishing trips and group camaraderie began. \n\"We just started doing everything as a group,\" Oubre said. \"We fish together a lot and if one of us is hungry, we all go eat. We're just really close.\" \nOubre wasn't the only transfer that had to get acclimated to a new school, teammates and scheme. But so did junior starting left tackle Cody Elenz , a University of Idaho transfer. \nElenz wasn't expecting the group to gel as quickly as it has, but said the fishing trips, along with the fact they live in the same apartment complex, has been key to their success. \n\"I didn't think we'd come together this quickly,\" Elenz said. \"But this is the most cohesion I've seen in a group since high school.\" \nLone returning starters Justin Brock and Bret Treadway were admittedly nervous about the Cardinals having to replace three starters. But the performances of Oubre, Elenz and junior Dante Cattaneo have eased those concerns. \n\"It wasn't difficult at all for us all to gel,\" Brock said. \"A lot of the new guys ended up having a lot of experience and it all helped out.\" \nBrock believes the offensive line won't peak until the end of the season, but their best game thus far was last week against Abilene Christian , when Harrington ran for a conference-record 347 yards. \n\"We've had the same five guys in there all season,\" Langston said. \"That's a big key to why we've been able to be so successful. \n\"They're all just best friends,\" Langston continued. \"It's like they've been together forever. I'm proud of what they've done so far.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:59:50.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
