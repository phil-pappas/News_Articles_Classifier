He’s also able to self-correct in the middle of an inning, often during an at-bat. One other metric to consider: Greinke was 10-1 at home this year. \nLOS ANGELES — There’s no remaining data that hasn’t already been crunched in the NL Division Series, so forget about a surprise ending in Game 5. The Mets and Dodgers know enough about each other to realize a) Jacob deGrom and Zack Greinke are poised for a savage pitchers’ duel and b), one way or another, it’s going to be a finish of biblical proportions. \nThat’s the beauty of a deciding game in the postseason: It wraps you up and makes short work of your nerves, your blood pressure, your sanity. The Mets say they’re ready for sudden death, but it’s closer to the truth to say they’re still ruing the missed opportunity at home in Game 4. \nInstead, they’re praying deGrom has the same fastball that crushed the Dodgers in Game 1. If not, the plan boils down to run ning up Greinke’s pitch count. In other words, good luck. \nHere are five questions that, depending how they’re answered, will go a long way in determining who faces the Cubs on Saturday and who goes home to a bitter winter. Nine innings, sudden death, pure tension. What’s not to love? \nWho has greater momentum? \nClayton Kershaw wasn’t far from the truth when he said, “It’s about even right now.” The Dodgers have the home crowd and the memory of their Game 4 conquest in front of a hostile audience in Flushing. Normally, that would count for plenty. But the Dodgers are understandably worried about deGrom and his ability to match Greinke inning for inning. \nStill, there’s no getting around the Mets’ struggles on the road this year, where they were only 41-40. They clearly thrive off the energy of a loud and aggressive fan base, which makes Kershaw’s Game 4 performance that much more impressive. The ticket buyers wanted blood; instead Kershaw silenced them. \nThe Dodgers will be much more comfortable at Chavez Ravine, where they won 55 games this regular season – tied for the most in the majors. It atmosphere counts for anything, the Dodgers have the edge. \nWho is more likely to dominate, deGrom or Greinke? \nIn terms of sheer swing-and-miss weaponry, deGrom is by far the more dynamic pitcher. He got the Dodgers to miss 24 times in Game 1, with 15 of them on pure heat up in the strike zone. No other right-hander in the game has the ability to dominate hitters with fastballs the way deGrom can on his good nights. \nBut he’s not a machine, either. The Yankees destroyed deGrom earlier this year, hitting three runs off him in five innings at the Stadium. Unlike Greinke, who relies more on precision, deGrom needs that extra 2-3 mph to get away with his “Take that” ethos. \nGreinke is arguably the most prepared hurler in the game – he spends hours studying video of opposing hitters. He’s also able to self-correct in the middle of an inning, often during an at-bat. One other metric to consider: Greinke was 10-1 at home this year. \nDeGrom was a respectable 8-4 with a 3.09 ERA on the road in the regular season, but he allowed 14 home run in 96 innings. \nIs Yoenis Cespedes the difference-maker in the Mets’ lineup? \nA’s general manager Billy Beane, who had Cespedes from 2012-14, calls the Cuban outfielder “a total money player” who performs best when the stakes are highest. “Yoenis is definitely not afraid of pressure.” \nAnyone who saw what Cespedes’ second-deck home run in Game 3 understand how much raw power he brings to Terry Collins’ lineup. But it takes an enormous swing to generate that much torque, and Greinke did indeed get burned in Game 2 – surrendering an HR to Cespedes in his first at-bat. \nBut he’ll be doing the Dodgers a favor if he tries to hit the ball to the cosmos every time he steps to the plate tonight. One talent evaluator says, “With a swing that big, [Cespedes] can be pitched to.” Greinke has undoubtedly learned his lesson, as he retired Cespedes in two subsequent at-bats in Game 2. \nIf Cespedes is neutralized, the run-producing responsibility will fall to David Wright and Lucas Duda, who are 3-for-27 with 14 strikeouts so far. \nWho does deGrom have to worry about most? \nBelieve it or not, it’s not Adrian Gonzalez, who has the purest swing in the Dodgers’ lineup but has only two extra-base hits in 16 at-bats and has struck out seven times. Nor will deGrom likely be threatened by Carl Crawford, Yasmani Grandal and Corey Seager, who’ve combined for four hits in 31 at-bats. \nIt’s Justin Turner who poses a problem; he has bat speed and good plate coverage and isn’t afraid of high-leverage situations. Turner is batting .467 (7-for-15) against the Mets, and his at-bats against deGrom will be priceless. It’ll be heat against bat speed, an October treat. \nKershaw praised Turner on Tuesday night, after his two-run double off Steven Matz helped Los Angeles to its 3-1 win. \n“I never thought [Turner] would be this good of a hitter,” Kershaw said. “He’s one of the best hitters in the game. We thought he’d be a great utility player and he’s turned into our three-, four-hole hitter. Can’t say enough about him.” \nIs Terry Collins managing for his job? \nProbably not. He’s already been assured by ownership that a conversation will take place after the season; by all indications, Collins will pull down another three-year contract no matter how the Mets do in Game 5. He’s won the respect of his players and helped the Mets catch and pass the Yankees in 2015 — no small feat. \nIt also tells you something that Cespedes has changed the language in his contact to give the Mets a chance to sign him as a free agent. The slugger wouldn’t have done so unless he like and respected Collins. That hasn’t gone unnoticed by ownership.
