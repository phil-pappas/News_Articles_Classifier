After an offseason full of drama, coach Jay Gruden is starting to prove that there was actually a method to all of his madness and most of that madness involved naming Kirk Cousins the starting quarter for the entire season. \nCousins hasn't been perfect, but seven weeks into the season, he has Washington in contention in the NFC East and more importantly, he might have finally won over the Redskins' rabid fan base thanks to the 24-point comeback he engineered in Washington's 31-30 win over the Buccaneers on Sunday. \nBefore this week, if you had told a Redskins fan that Washington would be trailing 24-0 in the second quarter against Tampa Bay, they probably would've assumed the game ended with Gruden getting fired and Cousins getting benched. \nThat's not what happened though, instead, Gruden gambled on his team and Cousins looked spectacular. \nThe heart of the comeback started on Washington's opening possession of the third quarter. After the Redskins forced a Tampa punt, Washington took over and Cousins put together four-play, 60-yard touchdown drive that trimmed the lead to 24-14. Cousins went 4 of 5 for 49 yards on the drive. \nAfter the touchdown, Gruden made one of the riskiest calls of his short coaching career: AN ONSIDE KICK!\nWhen you try an onside kick... And recover. #TBvsWAS https://t.co/Cpkp9fFHgk \n— NFL (@NFL) October 25, 2015 The Redskins recovered the kick and Cousins responded by leading Washington on another scoring drive. Cousins went 8 of 11 for 97 yards and two touchdowns on the two drives. \nCousins was big on both of those drives, but neither would go down as his most impressive drive of the day, that honor would belong to an 80-yard drive that Cousins put together in the fourth quarter. \nWith Washington trailing 30-24, the Redskins took over from their own 20 with just 2:24 left. Cousins completed his first eight passes on the drive and at that point, there was no stopping the Redskins. The drive ended when Cousins hit Jordan Reed with a touchdown pass with just 24 seconds left. \nThe Redskins quarterback really liked throwing to Reed, who finished the game with 11 catches for 72 yards and a touchdown. \nCousins finished with 317 yards and needless to say, he was kind of excited after the game. \nRedskins Postgame Live followed by #RedskinsTalk on CSN? Kirk Cousins has a message for you. https://t.co/jB2DazP5bH \n— CSN Redskins (@CSNRedskins) October 25, 2015 The Redskins are living and dying with Cousins: In seven games this season, they're 0-4 when he throws an interception and 3-0 when he doesn't, which means Cousins can't be making stupid mistakes. \nThe Redskins quarterback didn't make any against Tampa Bay and that's why he was able to pull off the biggest comeback in team history. The 24-point comeback is also tied for the fifth-biggest regular season comeback in NFL history.\nCousins' 33 completions in the game were a Redskins record. \nCousins, 1st Redskins QB with 300 passing yards, 3 TD passes & no interceptions in a win since Brad Johnson did so against the Panthers '99\n— Dianna Marie Russini (@diannaESPN) October 25, 2015 The only record that matters right now though is 3-4, and that's good enough to put Washington in the NFC East race. It's also good enough to make Redskins fans smile at the quarterback who might just be good enough to get Washington to the playoffs. Redskins fans are actually happy with Kirk Cousins. (USATSI) You're probably not going to win 12 games with Cousins as your quarterback. Fortunately for the Redskins, it might only take nine or 10 wins to take the NFC East this year.\n\nTeam Grade Analysis Panthers 27, Eagles 16 B- Chip Kelly's offense works a lot better when receivers aren't dropping every pass thrown to them and that's basically what happened on Sunday night. Eagles receivers combined to drop 8 passes, including a drop by Miles Austin on a fourth down late in the fourth quarter. Kelly was probably encouraged by his running game though, which totaled a season-high 177 yards, the Eagles highest rushing total since October 2014. It's probably taking a little longer than Kelly would like, but it looks like the Eagles offense is slowly coming together. B+ The Panthers went 2-of-9 on third down and Cam Newton threw three interceptions, other than that though, Carolina was almost perfect. The Panther defense spent most of the game torturing Sam Bradford, who was sacked five times. Jared Allen and Kawann Short each tallied two of those. Offensively, Jonathan Stewart had a huge game, rushing for a season-high 125 yards. If that sounds surprising, it should be, that's only the second time Stewart has hit that number since 2011. Redskins 31, Buccaneers 30 B- The Buccaneers are going to be scratching their heads about this loss for a long time. Most of the blame has to go on coach Lovie Smith, who might have to have his defensive guru title taken away after watching his team blow a 24-0 lead. Getting called for 16 penalties also didn't help Tampa. Washington was only flagged four times. B+ Jay Gruden has insisted for weeks that Kirk Cousins can work in Washington and his patience finally paid off as Cousins played a brilliant second half against Tampa Bay. Cousins threw three touchdown passes in the half as Washington fought back from a 24-0 deficit. The comeback actually started in the first half though when Cousins RAN for a touchdown. Cousins threw for 317 yards, marking the first time in his career he threw for over 300 yards WITHOUT throwing an INT. Jaguars 34, Bills 31 in London B- In a span of 10 seconds in this game, EJ Manuel made everyone in Buffalo wish the Bills had kept Matt Cassel . During an ugly span in the second quarter, Manuel single-handedly gave the Jaguars two touchdowns on consecutive plays (pick-six, Jags return fumble for TD). The Bills QB also set up another TD for Jacksonville later in the second quarter with another interception. If Tyrod Taylor 's not ready to play next week, the Bills might want to just run the single-wing. B The Jags defense seemed to really enjoy their trip to London. Not only did they force four turnovers, but they also sacked EJ Manuel four times. T.J. Yeldon also seemed to enjoy the London air, the rookie RB rushed for a season-high 115 yards. Blake Bortles had an ugly game (13 of 29, 182 yards, 2 TD, 1 pick-6), but those can be excused when your defense scores two TDs and when you thrown a brilliant game-winning pass. Vikings 28, Lions 19 B+ Vikings CB Terence Newman said recently that WR Stefon Diggs is a \"potentiall Hall of Famer \" and if Sunday's game is any indication, Newman might not be far off. Diggs tallied 108 yards against the Lions, including a wild 36-yard TD catch that gave Minnesota its first lead. D The Lions get an 'A' for the first quarter and an 'F' for the rest of the game. From the end of the first quarter through the four-minute mark in the fourth quarter, the Lions had exactly zero yards on offense. Saints 27, Colts 21 B+ The good news for the Saints this year is that Drew Brees doesn't have to be great for them to win. Brees was average against Indy, but the Saints came away with the win thanks to Mark Ingram . Ingram averaged 10.2 yards per carry (14 carries, 143 yards) and was a big reason the Colts defense couldn't get off the field. The Saints offense had the ball for 38:23 of the game. D Andrew Luck was so bad against New Orleans that he actually got booed in this game. Luck completed zero passes in the first quarter and ended up finishing the first half with 79 yards and two INTs. Griff Whalen was also a goat again. The special teams guy who snapped the ball on that horrible fake punt play against New England fumbled away a kickoff in this game. Chiefs 23, Steelers 13 C- There's a reason Landry Jones is a third-string QB and he showed it on Sunday. Making the first start of his career, Jones threw two picks and lost a fumble. The Steelers probably should've gone with less Jones and more Le'Veon Bell in the game. Bell finished with17 carries for 121 yards. A The Chiefs didn't have Jamaal Charles or Jeremy Maclin , but they were still somehow able to produce enough offense to pull this off and Charcandrick West was a big reason why. The 2014 undrafted free agent ran for 110 yards and a TD. The Chiefs defense was also impressive, besides forcing three turnovers, Tamba Hali beat up on Jones with two big sacks in the game. Dolphins 44, Texans 26 F The most embarrassing thing about the fact that the Texans trailed 41-0 in this game is that it wasn't even their worst deficit of the year. The Texans trailed 42-0 against Atlanta in Week 4. Basically, the Texans just need to fire everyone and start over. The loss wasn't even the worst part of the day either, Houston also lost Arian Foster for the rest of the season after he suffered a torn Achilles. A When Ryan Tannehill 's setting NFL records, you know the Dolphins are on fire. Tannehill completed 25 straight passes in a combination of this game and last game, breaking Donovan McNabb's record of 24. Lamar Miller had the biggest day though, rushing for 175 yards. Whatever Dan Campbell's doing in Miami, it's working. The Dolphins are now 2-0 under their new interim head coach. Not to mention, the win over the Texans was Miami's first-ever over Houston. Patriots 30, Jets 23 B The only way the Jets could've played any better against the Patriots is if they could've gotten their run game going, that didn't happen though. Chris Ivory (41 yards) was shut down and the Jets only totaled 89 yards on the ground, which isn't a great number for a team that went into the game averaging 146 yards per game. B+ There's a reason why you want Tom Brady team in the fourth quarter: He's clutch. After the Patriots went into the fourth quarter trailing 17-16, Brady finally went to work. Brady went 14 of 17 for 150 yards and two TDs in the game's final quarter. He also did something that you probably didn't think Tom Brady would ever do: He led the team in rushing (four carries, 15 yards). Rams 24, Browns 6 C- The Browns are going to have to spend some serious time on ball security drills this week because four lost fumbles is basically what cost Cleveland this game. Josh McCown fumbled twice, while Travis Benjamin and Taylor Gabriel each fumbled once. Those turnovers led to 17 St. Louis points, which really hurts when you lose by 18. B+ At this point, the Rams don't even technically need a quarterback to run their offense, they just need someone who's capable of handing the ball off to Todd Gurley . Nick Foles did that well enough on Sunday and Gurley ran for 128 yards and two TDs. The only thing more impressive than Gurley for St. Louis was the Rams defense, which forced four fumbles and recovered all of them, including a first quarter recovery that safety Rodney McCleod returned for a TD. The Rams' D also sacked McCown four times. Falcons 10, Titans 7 B- If NFL teams got style points for wins, the Falcons would have gotten zero for Sunday's victory. The Falcons did what they've been doing a lot lately: They rode their two MVP candidates to the win. Julio Jones (9 catches, 92 yards) and Devonta Freeman (25 carries, 116 yards) combined for 208 of Atlanta's 378 offensive yards. C The Titans' defense did everything it could to keep Tennessee in this game, but Zach Mettenberger and the offense wanted nothing to do with a possible win. Mettenberger threw two picks and the Titans were a brutal 1 of 9 on third downs. Raiders 37, Chargers 29 A Don't look now, but the Raiders have one of the most explosive offfenses in the NFL. Oakland's 37 points against San Diego means that the Raiders have scored 37 or more points twice in the same season for the first time since 2010. Before that, the Raiders hadn't done it since 2002. Thanks to Amari Cooper, Derek Carr and Latavius Murray, this team is actually fun to watch. F The scoreboard says the Chargers lost by eight, but this was a blowout in every since of the word. The Chargers were trailing 37-6 with 13 minutes left and were able to save themselves from a complete embarrassment by scoring three late touchdowns. After excruciating losses to the Steelers and Packers in the past two weeks, the feeling was that the Chargers could recover. This loss is one of those that makes you feel like their season might be over. Giants 27, Cowboys 20 B- All Matt Cassel had to do against the Giants on Sunday was be a good game manager and not lose it for them, and he couldn't even do that. Cassel threw three second half interceptions, including a costly pick-6. I never though I'd write this, but Brandon Weeden might have been a better QB option for Dallas. The good news for the Cowboys is that they might've found a running back. Darren McFadden rushed for 152 yards and a touchdown. B The Giant offense didn't do much and the defense got lit up to the tune of 460 total yards. That didn't matter though because the Giants got some huge individual efforts. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie returned an interception 58-yards for a TD and Dwayne Harris won the game with a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.
