You'll find pregame and postgame traffic maps that should help you find our way in and around campus and town. \nTwo road construction projects in and around Tuscaloosa will affect those traveling, especially anyone coming from Birmingham. Learn more about the lane-widening on I-59 and bridge reconstruction in Alberta City that travelers will run into this weekend and the rest of the season. \nFrom UA Gameday: \"Combine regular Gameday traffic with the roadwork on I-20/59 around exit 79 and we could be looking at severe backups on the traffic coming into town. Please leave early to allow extra time for possible backups and the reduced speed limits in the construction areas. Please check the two alternatives to bypass the backups: \nUtilizing Exit 89, which is the Mercedes Plant exit. This will give you easy access to Highway 11 westbound. Highway 11 will bring you straight into campus. Utilizing Exit 100, to easily access Highway 216 westbound. Highway 216 turns into 15th Street (Veteran's Memorial Parkway) once you arrive in Tuscaloosa. WILL CALL The Will Call window will open at 10:30 a.m. and is located between Gates 32 and 33 at Bryant-Denny Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:49:23.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
