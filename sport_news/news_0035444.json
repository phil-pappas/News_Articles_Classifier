Washington reportedly cold-shouldered Sharif's request for a Pakistan-US civil nuclear agreement and paid no heed to the dossiers alleging Indian involvement in Baluchistan. On the defence side, the returns from the visit amounted to a paltry half a squadron of F-16s. Neither did Sharif display Modi-like enthusiasm and verve while addressing the diaspora or interacting with US businessmen. The US was not keen on a civil nuclear deal with Pakistan anyway because, unlike India, it does not have the money to promise reactors to American companies in return. On Baluchistan, Indian support to non-state actors in Baluchistan was anyway going to be a non starter — unlike Jammu & Kashmir which has endured decades of consistent, brutal and spectacular instances of violence, besides open statements of support by Pakistani politicians. However, there was a lot of noise that could not be music to the ears of the South Block and the strategic hawks. For a start, the US once again pushed for a sustained Indo-Pak dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues, including Kashmir, and expressed concern over violence along the Line of Control. Undoubtedly, Pakistan's importance in the US scheme for the region has declined but it will be a grave error on our part to write it off. Pakistan instead won praise for its recent management of the economy and received US support for many regional trade and investment boosting initiatives such as a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan and the Pakistan-Central Asia power project. Clearly, while appreciating Pakistan’s role in facilitating the first Taliban-Kabul dialogue and the Zarb-e-Azb counter-terrorism operations, the US does not want Pakistan to punch above its weight on regional security issues. At the same time, Obama’s homily to Sharif to mend ties with India is as much a message to the South Block, and its artificial ‘red lines’ that have stalled Indo-Pak talks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:35.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
