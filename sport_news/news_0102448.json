But I know I have a good offensive line and solid coaching staff, so I knew we'd be fine.\"\nThe Friars (5-1, 1-0) also had sophomore running back O'Shaan Allison, who rushed for 194 yards and three touchdowns on 32 carries. He also caught a 13-yard touchdown. \n\"O'Shaan is great,\" Doyle said. \"When I transferred in, O'Shaan was great to me. He's in my grade, so I really think I connect with him. I always believe we can give him the ball. Whenever the passing isn't working, we go right to O'Shaan.\" \nThe aerial attack was just fine for the Friars. Doyle finished with 230 passing yards and two touchdown tosses on 21-of-34 passing. \nThe Friars defense forced Episcopal (5-1, 0-1) into four turnovers (two fumbles, two interceptions). \nEven when Doyle was intercepted, he rebounded quickly. Episcopal's Dan Baker victimized Doyle twice. \nThe second interception came just before halftime, and led to a Dee Barlee touchdown that cut Malvern's lead to 13-7 with 2 minutes, 20 seconds left. \nDoyle, however, led his team on an eight-play, 85- yard drive that ended with a 34-yard touchdown pass to Rashon Lusane with 6 seconds left in the half. \n\"Coach [Aaron Brady] walked me through the play afterward and I realized I made the wrong read,\" Doyle said. \"Just a mental error. I was fine with it. Luckily, the line picked me up, and we went right down before the half and scored . . . and I believe it picked the whole team up.
