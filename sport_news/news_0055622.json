The Vikings lost 72-42. A A A \nFoothill League football teams once again proved they aren’t the least bit afraid to face some serious Southern California powerhouses. \nOf all the tough opponents local teams have seen this year though, none of them are going to equal the mammoth test in front of Valencia tonight. \nThe Vikings (2-2) travel to face Centennial High of Corona, the No. 1 ranked team in California, according to Calpreps.com. The Maxpreps Xcellent 25 Writers’ Poll has Centennial (4-0) at second in the nation. The Maxpreps computer rankings peg this team at No. 3 in the country and USA Today has it at sixth. \nThe bottom line is this team is incredibly good, maybe even better than last year’s team that whipped Valencia 72-42 on the Vikings’ home field. It was the largest number of points ever scored on Valencia. \nWhere do you begin with this Huskies team? Calpreps lists seven of their senior players as NCAA Division I college football prospects, including four-star rated wide receiver Javon McKinley, who caught 97 passes for 2,062 yards and 25 touchdowns in 2014. \nThe long list of talented players continues with University of Arizona commit and running back J.J. Taylor, University of Washington commit and cornerback Kentrell Love, UC Berkeley commits Daniel Juarez (offensive line) and Camryn Bynum (cornerback), as well as Boise State commit and cornerback Desmond Williams. \nThree-star prospect and safety Chacho Ulloa joins the list of Centennial defensive backs who will likely play Division I. \nThat loaded secondary will be a major challenge for the Cole Parkinson-led Valencia offense, which seemingly hit its stride in scoring a combined 99 points in the last two weeks. \nThat unit, and the rest of the team, may need to play perfect to pull off a monumental upset. \nHart (3-1) vs. Ventura (2-3) \nJust like Valencia, Hart wraps up its non-league slate tonight. In the Indians’ case, this week is a chance to head into Foothill play as one the league’s hottest teams. \nHart and its more run-heavy offense will face a Ventura team that managed to shut out Saugus 20-0 two weeks ago. In that game on Sept. 18, Ventura picked off Saugus quarterbacks four times and was very effective in stuffing the run. \n“(Ventura has) a solid running attack, a disciplined defense and they recorded a shutout against Saugus,” said Hart head coach Mike Herrington. “They’ve moved the ball in a couple of their losses and just couldn’t do it in the red zone. You expect a team to eventually explode on the scoreboard when it comes together in the red zone. We just hope it’s not against us.” \nVentura’s run defense will be a key matchup to watch against a Hart offense averaging 192 rushing yards per game this season, led by the efforts of quarterback Nick Moore and running back Nelson James. \nAnd while the Cougars boast third-year varsity player Tyler Smith under center, they too like to run the ball with running backs Broc Mortensen and Roan Moran. \nStopping that attack will be the task at hand for the Hart front seven led by linebacker Charles Ike, who leads the team with 49 tackles. \nTrinity (2-1) vs. California School for the Deaf (0-3) \nLast week, Trinity felt as though it let a winnable game get away with a 28-26 setback to Southlands Christian. \nHere’s this team’s first opportunity to prove it can rebound. Trinity hosts a winless team in California School for the Deaf of Riverside today. \nIn three games, CSD has been outscored by a combined total of 147-6, with its only points coming in a 57-6 loss to Campbell Hall two weeks ago. \nThat one score was taken in by senior Zeniko Grant, who also ran for 105 yards on eight touches in that game. \nThe Knights, on the other hand, haven’t had much trouble putting up points with an average of 40 per game thus far. \nSCCS (3-1) vs. Southlands Christian (4-0) \nSince both teams have played in the San Joaquin League, Santa Clarita Christian has thoroughly dominated Southlands Christian in three straight contests dating back to 2012. \nThis weekend’s league opener may play out differently than those games, in which SCCS won 66-0 in 2012, 69-0 in 2013 and 63-10 last year. \nThis year’s Southlands team looks much improved. It’s four wins — including last week’s victory over Trinity — are already more than the team has won in an entire season since 2010. \nThe key for the Eagles appears to be a balanced attack made possible by some big, physical players. SCCS will have to try to contain 6-foot-1, 225-pound running back Samson Tufui, who picked up 80 yards on 10 carries against Trinity. \nQuarterback Scott Brashear has also been very effective as both a runner (163 yards) and passer (665 yards, nine touchdowns, three interceptions), particularly when he gets the ball to his top receiver Gabby Agudo. \nThis will also be a chance to see if Cardinals quarterback Tristan Miller can continue his historically good pace in the passing game. The junior has thrown for 1,372 yards, 22 touchdowns and four interceptions, which are numbers that rank highly among all signal callers in the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:31:50.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
