Their midfield quartet; Jerry Allotey, Derrick Sam, Manfred Kayo and Abu Mohammed were delightful to watch as they kept Celtic on the back foot. \nBut as Redemption kept pressing, they were finding it difficult to go through Celtic’s central defensive pair of Joseph Afful and the ever presence Suleiman Ibrahim who kept scrapping all the loose balls. \nHowever, it was Dansoman Celtic who created the first goal scoring opportunity of the game in the 14 th minute when striker Dennis Ansah was put through excellently by Jonathan Agyare but the striker flouted the golden opportunity. \nCeltic’s captain, Amos Ahyiah almost signed his goal account in the 19 th minute but his close range shot went off target. \nIn the 31 st minute, captain of Redemption FC, Abu Mohammed dunked in a beautiful 35-yard half volley but his effort was expertly tipped off for a corner kick by Celtic’s goalie Emmanuel Bassaw to the applause of the supporters. \nAs Dansoman Celtic kept asking questions in front of Redemption FC’s goal area, their chances of breaking the deadlock was just a matter of time. Kojo Padonu Mawuli headed home the first goal from Abubakar Moro’s corner kick to give Celtic the lead in the 41 st minute. \nWithin just a space of three minutes Dansoman Celtic had increased their lead to 2-0 courtesy Dennis Ansah’s close range strike in the 44 th minute. \nBack from the recess, Redemption FC went all attacking, but Celtic defence was resolute on the day making things difficult for their opponent to penetrate. \nAlex Bonney managed to pull one back for the visitors in the 82 nd minute with a non drop shot from Jerry Allotey’s in-swinger but it was too little too late to salvage a point for Redemption FC. \nFollow Amisty on twitter @ElAmistyNobo.www.sports24gh.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:40:44.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
