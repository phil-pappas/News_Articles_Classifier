Even the likes of Pascal Pape and Yoann Maestri,” he said. \n“We just know there is going to be a wave coming at us and that doesn’t include the guys with the footwork like Wesley Fofana.” \nSchmidt added: “I have known Wesley for seven or eight years, ever since he was coming through the system at Clermont. \n“He is an unbelievably good athlete and a very skilful one too. Coping with him and others is going to be a handful.” \nSchmidt has turned around a demoralised Ireland unit in his two years in charge. \nThe Irish have won two successive Six Nations titles and registered notable wins over southern hemisphere giants Australia and South Africa. \nBut that counted for nothing at the World Cup, Schmidt said, adding that he had shared a word with France coach Philippe Saint-Andre at a pre-tournament coaches’ meeting. \n“Philippe did tell me they were better than they’d ever been and more ready than they’d ever been. They’re been the fittest he’s had them,” Schmidt said. \nThoughts have turned to victory, the former schoolteacher insisted. The loser has to play New Zealand one week later. The winner of the pool gets a more attractive proposition in Argentina. \n“We have to come up with an accurate gameplan,” he said. \n“One of the things with France is that if you give them opportunities or you’re loose with the ball, your discipline’s not nailed on, you give them access and once they get momentum they’re very difficult to stop.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:39:48.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
