Speaking at a news conference at Abu Dhabi ahead of the series Pakistan Cricket Board officially ushered in the beginning of this season's cricket fever in the form of series to be played between Pakistan and England across the UAE. Pakistan captain Misbah's statement was contrasting as experts of the game and former captains Muhammad Yousuf, Aamir Sohail and Rashid Latif and other player have said Pakistan will have no problem in winning the Test series against England. Misbah acknowledged that the England team has learnt from the experiences of 2012 and will be raring to have a go at Pakistan. \"They are a young and determined team and they have practiced quite hard so, yes, it will not be easy for us,\" Misbah, said. Pakistan and England are gearing up for an exciting Test series with the first match of the series starting from October 13. Misbah maintained the team will have to focus on the basics and avoid all distractions -- including references of what happened in 2012. \"Of course we know what happened in 2012 but this will be a new series and we have to make sure that we get our basics rights,\" he said. He went to highlight that though spin sensation Yasir Shah will be a key player, only team-work will help Pakistan win the series. \"Yasir is in great form but it is not just up to him -- the entire squad will have to pitch in to ensure our success,\" Misbah, said.
