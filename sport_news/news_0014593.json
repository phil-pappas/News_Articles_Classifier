The members of Shikshak Sabha, the civic body's teachers' union, alleged that they did not receive any instructions in this regard from the BMC's education department.\nThe deputy director, Education, had issued a circular to all the city schools to celebrate October 15 as Vaachan Prerna Divas to honour Kalam and to promote a habit of reading. The students were asked to bring only one non-educational book and no bags. In most of the BMC schools, however, students came with their bags as they had no information about the celebrations.\nRamesh Joshi, general secretary of the BMC's Shikshak Sabha, said, \"It is very sad to know that our education department did not send any circular to our schools about celebrating the birth anniversary of our former president of India. They should have sent guidelines on how to celebrate Vaachan Prerna Divas in our schools.\"\nEchoing his sentiments, Nasiruddin Shaikh, vice-president of the Shikshak Sabha, said, \"Like the deputy director of education, BMC education officer should also have issued a circular to schools on how to celebrate Dr Kalam's birth anniversary.\"\nDespite repeated calls, Education Officer Shambhavi Jogi remained unavailable for comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:54:37.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
