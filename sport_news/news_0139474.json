I’ll remember that for the rest of my life.” \nDiCanio, whose second 1-yard touchdown run of the game had put the Dukes (4-5, 2-4 West Suburban Silver) ahead 12-10 on the first play of the fourth quarter, completed his last six passes, four of them to Wozny. \n“Everybody just worked together on that last drive,” Wozny said. “The line, Johnny, everybody was making great plays. We stepped up too as receivers and made big plays.” \nThe clock was running as DiCanio changed plays at the line and lofted a fade pass to Wozny in the right corner of the end zone for the decisive score. \n“Johnny practically called an audible and perfect pass right there,” said Wozny, who also made the game-winning touchdown catch in York’s home opener against Leyden. “All I had to do was catch it. \n“He’s always scrambling around and making plays and it’s great. We’ve got great chemistry.” \nThat chemistry extended to the defense, which held Lyons (5-4, 2-4) to just 25 yards of offense in the second half. Defensive lineman Marc Bernard had a career-high three sacks as the Dukes stuffed the run and the pass. \n“We knew what they wanted to do coming in and it was our last game so we just let it all out there,” Bernard said. “We stopped the run and our corners played great, stopped the pass. Best game I’ve ever played in.” \nThe Lions might have had similar sentiments had it ended a couple minutes earlier. Despite blowing a 10-0 lead, LT found new life when Ryan Kelly recovered a muffed punt at the York 19 and six plays later Ben Bryant fired a 16-yard TD pass to Hasahn Austin to put the Lions up 16-12 with 3:29 left. \n“We’ve got to be more consistent,” Lyons Township coach Kurt Weinberg said. “We came out like gangbusters and the first drive we looked great and scored a big touchdown and then we went on a long scoring drought.” \nThe Lions head into the playoffs on a three-game losing streak, but Weinberg wasn’t stunned by York’s performance. \n“This game made me nervous from the beginning,” Weinberg said. “That team in most conferences would be a 6-3 or 7-2 football team. \n“They’re well-coached, they’re extremely organized and disciplined and they play hard, so I didn’t like playing this game at the end (of the season).” \nDiCanio passed for 126 yards and added 90 yards rushing on 20 carries. Alexander carried nine times for 80 yards while Wozny finished with seven catches for 57 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:28:05.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
