Ben Gray / bgray@ajc.com The report, written by former Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers and investigator Richard Hyde, accused May of accepting an illegal loan from a former county employee. May denied that he was loaned any money by Morris Williams, the county commission’s former chief of staff, and he said he wasn’t paid any money related to repairs of his house.\nMay, who hired the investigators, said he still believes it was the right decision, but he was disappointed with their quality of the work in their 40-page report. He said the investigators are charging the county $850,000 for their work, but he doesn’t intend to pay all of that amount.\n“I have to apologize to the taxpayers for this. I erred in the selection of Mike Bowers,” May said. “What we have to date is wasteful, and I’m going to be asking for some of our money back.\nMay also denied using public money for an adult movie during a trip to Hawaii.
