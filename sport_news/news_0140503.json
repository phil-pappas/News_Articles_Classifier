Facebook Over the years, Westword has featured plenty of stories about crimes solved by DNA found in unlikely places .\nTake the cigarette butt that led to the killer of Kurt Levias at the Bluebird Theater.\nBut never before have we encountered a shittier DNA case than the one involving Rodney Hendrix, who was recently busted for a crime committed last year thanks to \"fecal matter\" on a pair of shorts he left behind.\nIf ever there was a tale (tail?) made for our Schmuck of the Week category, it's this one.\nThe details come from an arrest affidavit on view below.\nA sinister looking Facebook portrait of Rodney Hendrix.

A detective assigned to the case was informed that after the crime, a pair of shorts spotted with human waste were found in a restroom at the school.\nThe shorts didn't belong to a staff member, leading investigators to surmise that they'd once covered the can of the burglar. Hence, they were submitted for DNA testing.\nOne more Facebook portrait of Rodney Hendrix. Facebook Getting the results took a while â€” over a year, in fact. But on September 30 of this year, the crime lab scored a hit with someone whose DNA was already in the system: Rodney Hendrix.\nThe suspect wasn't tough to track down: Hendrix was already in custody on unrelated theft and drug beefs.\nNow, the Denver District Attorney's Office has formally smacked Hendrix with two counts apiece of burglary and theft, plus an identity theft accusation. He'll be formally advised of the charges against him on October 16.\nA little refresher course on hygiene has yet to be scheduled, but it definitely couldn't hurt.\nHere's Hendrix's booking photo, followed by the arrest affidavit.\nRodney Hendrix.
