The club has the most expensive shirts too - Â£60 for an adult shirt and £45 for a junior. \nThat is still considerably cheaper than Barcelona's adult shirt, which costs £89.55 - the most expensive out of the 227 teams in the study. \nAberdeen's £55 adult shirt and their £43 junior shirt were the costliest in Scotland. \nThe cheapest season ticket at German champions Bayern Munich is £104.48. \nOther findings include: \n:: Liverpool and Glasgow Rangers have the most expensive cup of tea at £2.50. The average is £2.09 and cost just £1 at Chelsea. \n:: The average pie costs £3.35 in the top flight, up 1.82 per cent. Kidderminster Harriers charge £4.50 for their award-winning pie but they cost just £1 at Conference side Braintree. \n:: In Scotland, at £1.20, the cheapest pies are at Forfar and Queen's Park. \n:: Arsenal again have the most expensive match day ticket in the Premier League at £97. The cheapest matchday ticket in the top flight is £22 at Leicester. \n:: Chelsea's cheapest match day ticket is £52 - no other club charges as much for its cheapest ticket. \n:: The Scottish Premiership's cheapest ticket now costs £20.17 on average after a 1.2 per cent fall in price - cheaper the Championship and League One. \n:: Tickets in the Women's Super League in England, which saw attendances increase by 48 per cent after the summer's World Cup, cost less than £5. \n:: Derby, Reading and Huddersfield all have £10 match day tickets - the cheapest in the top five leagues in England and only matched by Southport in the Conference. \n:: The average price of a programme is now £3.42, up nearly seven per cent. \n:: Swansea were the only club out of 230 across the UK who declined to take part in the study. \nThe average admission price paid in the Football League during the 2014-15 campaign was £14.08 per supporter - £15.65 in the Championship, £11.72 in in League One and £11.58 in League Two. \nFootball League chief executive Shaun Harvey said: \"Football League clubs continue to offer compelling football at a price that is affordable, particularly for those buying season tickets who are rewarded for their loyalty and financial commitment with the best-value ticket offerings. \n\"The significant numbers of season ticket holders at matches, along with ever-greater numbers of young fans, has resulted in the average price paid per paying spectator being as low as Â£14 across the League's 72 clubs. \n\"Clearly others, such as adults and those paying on the day, will usually pay more. Clubs therefore need to ensure that their ticketing policies provide the right balance between fair value for supporters and generating the income that sustains on-field performance, which overwhelmingly they do.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:08:44.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
