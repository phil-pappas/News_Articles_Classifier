That still leaves two more cuts to make to get down to the regular-season roster limit of 15 players, and the Nets will have some real decisions to make.\nNone of the cuts were particularly surprising, nor was the fact the team — at least for now — hung onto Dahntay Jones and Justin Harper, both of whom have earned praise from Nets coach Lionel Hollins throughout the preseason.\nBy cutting Boatright, the path appears clear for Donald Sloan, who has played well this month, to be the third point guard alongside Jarrett Jack and Shane Larkin. But if the Nets want to keep either Jones or Harper, they will have to shed either one of their 13 guaranteed contracts or that of Willie Reed. Reed was guaranteed $500,000 when he signed this summer, but will miss the next six to eight weeks after undergoing surgery Friday to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his right thumb.\nThere’s also the matter of the team’s perilous depth at power forward and center. With Andrea Bargnani (hamstring) and Chris McCullough (knee surgery rehab) missing the entire preseason and Reed now out for an extended period, the Nets currently only have three healthy bigs, which could play a role in how they handle their final roster decisions.\nTeams must have their regular-season rosters set by Monday. The Nets open their season Wednesday in Brooklyn against the Bulls.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brooklyn nets ,  ryan boatright", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:00:20.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
