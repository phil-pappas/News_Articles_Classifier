They will add infielder Matt Reynolds to the roster, a person with knowledge of the move confirmed. \nReynolds has never played a major league game. \nThe Mets lost Tejada Saturday night on a bone-crunching slide by Chase Utley in their Game 2 loss. The Dodgers infielder slid out of his way and into Tejada to break up a double play with no attempt to get to the bag. Tejada has a fractured right fibula. \nHe pushed to make the roster out of spring training but never debuted during the year. He hit .267 with a .721 OPS this season at Triple-A. Reynolds was the Mets' second round pick in the 2012 draft. \nRELATED : Chipper Jones rips Los Angeles Dodgers' Chase Utley's dirty slide vs. Mets \nHe was not among the three position players the Mets sent to Port St. Lucie, Fla. off their major league roster to serve as a taxi squad. Neither Eric Campbell nor Eric Young Jr. is a middle infielder. Reynolds can play second, short and third. \nNewsday was the first to report the move. \nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @Mike_Vorkunov .
