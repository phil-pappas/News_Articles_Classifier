The Colonels (2-5) meet their biggest rival, Highlands, this Saturday. The Bluebirds (2-5) also won last week, topping Dixie Heights 42-7. It's been a disheartening year for both squads; a rivalry win in district play would be a nice pick-me-up. \nSophomore Grant Dyer rushed for 109 yards and two TDs for CovCath in the win. The Colonels went down 6-0 early but answered with a 34-0 run. \nNick Kendall rushed 26 times for 115 yards and two TDs for Highlands in its victory. \nKevin Whitaker rushed for 107 yards and a TD and threw for 195 and two TDs in Leslie County's 30-20 win at Prestonsburg. The Eagles improved to 7-0 and will travel to Shelby Valley (6-1) in a big Class 2A, District 8 game this week. \nKent Phelps reached 1,000 yards on the season after running for 230 yards and three TDs in Paintsville's 38-12 win at Fairview. \nUniversity of Kentucky commit Kash Daniel reached 100 tackles on the year after getting 10 in the win. Daniel rushed for 64 yaqrds and threw for 73 yards and a TD.>/li> \nPulaski County cruised to its fifth straight win, topping Lincoln County 56-6. Riley Hall went 15-for-20 for 259 yards and two TDs for the Maroons (6-1). \nSophomore Kaylon Luster showed out for Fort Knox in its 74-44 win over McCreary Central.

Madison Central won the girls' edition by three strokes. \nFranklin County's C.J. Jones and Paducah Tilghman's Teri Doss took individual medalist honors. \nJohn Augenstein of Owensboro Catholic finished first in All-State points on the boys' side. Madison Central's Tristyn Nowlin accomplished the feat for the girls. \nFinal All-State point standings (boys and girls). \nSoccer \nThe postseason starts this week with the district tournaments. Here are the pairings for the 11th Region boys' and girls' teams. \nBoys \nMonday: Woodford County vs. Western Hills, 8 p.m. Tuesday: Franklin County vs. Frankfort, 8 p.m. Thursday (Finals): Semifinals winners, 8 p.m. \n42nd District at Bryan Station \nWednesday: Henry Clay vs. Scott County, 6 p.m.; Sayre vs. Bryan Station, 8 p.m. Thursday (Finals): Semifinals winners, 8 p.m. \n43rd District at Lafayette \nMonday: Tates Creek vs. Lexington Christian, 7 p.m. Tuesday: Lafayette vs. Paul Dunbar, 6 p.m.; Lexington Catholic vs. Tates Creek-LCA winner, 8 p.m. Thursday (Finals): Semifinals winners, 7 p.m. \n44th District at Madison Southern \nMonday: Madison Central vs. Berea, 8 p.m. Tuesday: Madison Southern vs. Model, 8 p.m. Thursday: Semifinals winners, 8 p.m. \nGirls \nMonday: Woodford County vs. Frankfort, 6 p.m. Tuesday: Franklin County vs. Western Hills, 6 p.m. Thursday (Finals): Semifinals winners, 6 p.m. \n42nd District at Bryan Station \nTuesday: Henry Clay vs. Sayre, 6 p.m.; Scott County vs. Bryan Station, 8 p.m. Thursday (Finals): Semifinals winners, 6 p.m. \n43rd District at Tates Creek \nMonday: Tates Creek vs. Lafayette, 7 p.m. Tuesday: Lexington Catholic vs. Tates Creek-Lafayette winner, 6 p.m.; Paul Dunbar vs. Lexington Christian, 8 p.m. Thursday (Finals): Tuesday's winners, 7 p.m. \n44th District at Madison Southern \nMonday: Madison Central vs. Berea, 6 p.m. Tuesday: Madison Southern vs. Model, 6 p.m. Thursday (Finals): Semifinals winners, 6 p.m. \nGirls' district tournament schedules for next week. \nVolleyball \nThe final week of the regular season tips off on Monday. Here are the district tournament schedules for the teams in Region 11: \n41st District at Franklin County \nOct. 20: Woodford County vs. Franklin County, 6 p.m. Oct. 21 (Finals): Western Hills vs. TBD, 6 p.m. \n42nd District at Bryan Station \nOct. 20: Henry Clay vs. Sayre, 6 p.m.; Scott County vs. Bryan Station, 7:30 p.m. Oct. 21 (Finals): Semifinals winners, 7 p.m. \n43rd District at Paul Laurence Dunbar \nOct. 19: Lexington Catholic vs. Lafayette, 6 p.m. Oct. 20: No. 2 seed vs. No. 3 seed, 6; Monday's winner vs. No. 1 seed, 7:30 Oct. 21 (Finals): Semifinals winners, 6:30 \nThis district's pairings still to be determined because the top three seeds are up in the air. The outcome of Lexington Christian's game at Tates Creek is the final key to the equation. \nIf Tates Creek wins, it will go 4-0 in district play and be the No. 1 seed. Paul Dunbar (3-1 in district) would be No. 2 and LCA would be third with a 2-2 district record. \nShould LCA pull off the upset, three teams would finish with a 3-1 district record. That would lead to a blind draw for the first seed, with the other two seeds determined base on the head-to-head record of those squads. \nLexington Catholic (1-3 in district) and Lafayette (0-4) are locked into the fourth and fifth seed, respectively. \n44th District at Berea \nOct. 19: Madison Southern vs. Berea, 6 p.m. Oct. 20 (Finals): Madison Central vs. TBD, 6 p.m. \nThe latest Kentucky Volleyball Coaches Association poll was released on Thursday.
