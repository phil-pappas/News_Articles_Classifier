This is season two for the Jackals under head coach Jamie Russell, and also their second season as an affiliate of the National Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres and the American Hockey League's Rochester Americans. \nThe Jackals open the season with five players assigned from those teams: forwards Colin Jacobs, Cason Hohmann, Allan McPherson and Matt Garbowsky, along with goalie C.J. Motte. They join a 22-player roster that includes eight players who played for Elmira last season. \nAmong those back is forward Mike Seidel, who posted career highs in goals (23) and points (42) in 58 games with the Jackals last season. \n\"Everyone's definitely excited,\" Seidel said Wednesday after a morning practice. \"It's been a long summer and obviously a little disappointing with not making the playoffs last year. We've got a real hungry group anxiously awaiting opening night. I think we have a lot of good skill, a lot of good role players, too, and we can definitely do something special here this year.\" Elmira Jackals 2015-2016 schedule \nA strong start last year fizzled in the second half, with the Jackals hit hard by call-ups to AHL teams. Elmira ended up with a 32-40 record, including seven shootout losses, and finished sixth out of seven teams in the Eastern Conference's East Division. That division has a much different look this season, with Elmira joined by Adirondack, the Reading Royals and two teams that previously played in the AHL under the same names: the Manchester Monarchs and Norfolk Admirals. The ECHL includes 14 teams in the Eastern Conference and 14 in the Western. Adirondack's return to the league renews a rivalry with Elmira that dates back to the United Hockey League. \n\"Guys are chomping at the bit to get going,\" Russell said. \"We've had some players who are here who have been through the Sabres' development camp in July, the Sabres' rookie tournament, the Sabres' main camp, Rochester's main camp, the Elmira Jackals' main camp. They want to play a game that has meaning. Not that those games don't mean anything, but there's no points on the line.\" \nElmira advanced to the ECHL playoffs in each of its first six seasons in the ECHL before missing out the last two years. The Jackals reached the postseason in four of their seven seasons in the now defunct UHL. \n\"Last year we had a great first half,\" said Russell, an assistant at Providence College for three seasons before he was hired by the Jackals. \"We were playing for first place overall in the league and then we had so many guys that were elevated to the American League. This is a developmental league. That's part of our purpose, to develop guys and get them ready for the next level. We also want to win a championship. I don't think those two things have to be competing against each other.\" \nThe Jackals remain without a league title in their history and this year's group is hoping to change that. \n\"We're excited for another year,\" said returning goaltender Sam Marotta. \"Last year we had our moments and we just couldn't pull it together toward the end of the year, but I know this town is ready for a team to do something special. I really want to be on the team that gives it to them.\" Buy Photo \nCason Hohmann (left) and other Jackals await their shift during a preseason game with Reading at First Arena on Oct. 9.

He said the three worked hard this offseason and he expects there to be more of a benefit for the Jackals in terms of the talent pool. \n\"From our end, from Buffalo and Rochester's end, they've been nothing short of fantastic,\" Russell said. \"They've stepped up, they've signed a lot more players. There's way more depth in the organization.\" \nJacobs has been assigned by Buffalo from Rochester. Motte, Hohmann, McPherson and Garbowsky are all assigned from Rochester. Garbowsky was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award as college hockey's top player last season as a senior at the Rochester Institute of Technology, then played eight games with the Americans. \nRussell is happy with the rest of the current roster as well. \n\"We've added some great pieces to the puzzle with our recruiting in the offseason,\" he said. \"We return some great pieces, so I really think we've got a lot of balance throughout our lineup in terms of scoring. We've got some size, we've got some grit. I think we'll be strong on the power play. I'm excited to see what these forwards can do. ... I think we're going to be able to score more this year.\" \nMcPherson and Jacobs played for Elmira last season, as did fellow forward Taylor Stefishen. Also playing up front are Will Kessel, Scott Jacklin, Justin Bernhardt, Nick Zappia and Mark Bennett. \nRounding out the forwards are Chris Langkow and Garrett Klotz. Langkow had 13 goals and 23 assists in 133 games over the last two seasons with Bridgeport of the AHL. The 6-foot-6, 250-pound Klotz has 337 professional games under his belt and is known as an enforcer. \nThe defense benefits from the addition of Nathan Oystrick, 32, a player/assistant coach who has NHL experience with three teams and provides added leadership. \n\"He's done a great job here of working with the younger defensemen and helping them develop,\" Russell said. \"He's a guy who's played 60, 70 games in the National League, he's got hundreds of games in the American League level, he's played in the (Kontinental Hockey League). So his experience on the back end is going to be invaluable here as we move forward.\" \nOther defensemen are returners Zach Tolkinen, Joe Houk and Jacob MacDonald. They are joined by Brad Richard, Kevin Clare and Mitchell Stretch. \n\"Jamie does an unreal job recruiting (defensemen), even when guys get called up and you have to bring in new guys,\" Marotta said. \"I think we have one of the best (defensive) cores in the league. I'm confident going into a game that if I do my job, we're going to come out on top.\" \nRussell likes what he has at goalie with Motte and Marotta, who had a .910 save percentage in 36 games with the Jackals last season. Motte played in four games with Bridgeport of the AHL last season after a standout career at Ferris State. \n\"All three areas — in net, on the back end and forwards — we're going to be very strong,\" Russell said. \nSeidel said special teams are one area that need to get better this season. \n\"In this league, it's huge for special teams — penalty kill/power play,\" he said. \"We stress that we want to get top 10 in both in the league. Last year we were just OK, I believe. There were some stretches where we were awesome on the (penalty kill) and certain stretches where we weren't, so we've definitely got to clean up that and the defensive zone a little bit.\" Buy Photo \nMatt Garbowsky, a 2015 Hobey Baker Award finalist from RIT, skates with the puck against Reading on Oct. 9 at First Arena.

So they can't afford to give away points even this early in the season. \n\"The playoff hunt starts on Friday,\" he said. \n\"I think we've got a pretty good team here. A lot of veteran experience with Oysty player/coaching. He knows a lot. Then we've got guys like Langkow, Klotzy, guys we didn't have. Last year we only had a few vets, so it's good to get the veteran experience. I think that's going to come up huge for us this year.\" \nMarotta added that the mix of youth and veterans has been strong so far. Seidel also likes the team chemistry, an often overlooked element of success, as the Jackals get going. \n\"I think it's an awesome mix,\" he said of the roster. \"Just from the first couple of weeks, the guys in the locker room are awesome and Jamie always has a knack for getting good off-ice guys, as well as on the ice. They come to work. We still have a lot of laughs in the locker room, but when it comes on the ice everyone's all business. A really good, talented group I think.\" \nWEEKEND SCHEDULE \nFriday : 7:05 p.m. vs. Adirondack at First Arena (all fans receive magnet schedule). \nSaturday : 7:05 p.m. vs. Brampton at First Arena (anti-bullying game with T-shirt giveaway from Big Foote's Sporting Goods to first 1,000 fans) \nTickets : jackalshockey.com or (607) 734-7825. \nRadio : WELM (1410-AM). \nJACKALS ROSTER \nForwards : Chris Langkow, Mike Seidel, Matt Garbowsky, Taylor Stefishen, Will Kessel, Scott Jacklin, Allan McPherson, Cason Hohmann, Garrett Klotz, Colin Jacobs, Justin Bernhardt, Nick Zappia, Mark Bennett \nDefensemen : Nathan Oystrick, Brad Richard, Zach Tolkinen, Jacob MacDonald, Joe Houk, Kevin Clare, Mitchell Stretch. \nGoalies : C.J.
