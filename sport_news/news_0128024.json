(AP) - An attorney for state prison inmates says last week's boil order at the State Penitentiary at Parchman is another sign of the prison's aging and unstable infrastructure.\nVanessa Carroll tells The Clarion-Ledger ( http://on.thec-l.com/1QSvFMd ) that inmates \"will continue to suffer unsanitary and unhealthy living conditions.\"\nMississippi Department of Corrections officials say they provide healthy conditions and will continue to fix problems.\nThe state Health Department issued a boil-water alert for the prison on Sept. 28. The department found an indicator for bacteria in a drinking water sample, but further tests found no bacteria, and the boil order was lifted Thursday.\nAlesha Judkins of the Southern Poverty Law Center says she got several calls from relatives of inmates in one unit, saying the water was causing cramps, diarrhea, rashes and vomiting.\nThis story has been corrected to show the Mississippi Health Department found no harmful bacteria\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
