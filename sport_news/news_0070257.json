It'd be best to poke it with a stick first to make sure it's safe. A lot of times, after eating something real weird, I usually get asked \"Well how do you feel after eating that?\"\nThe response usually falls into three groups:\nA) The giant food: Usually some giant sub, with double chicken Parm, mozzarella sticks and a half-pound of bacon on it. You feel like you just ate an anvil, but you regret nothing.\nB) The super heavy food: Similar, but not as big. This is usually along the lines of a deep-fried cheesecake or a double stuffed pumpkin doughnut. I try not to eat too much, but end up overdoing it and spend the no idea whether or not I'm hungry afterwards since those two bites were probably 1,500 calories.\nC) The weird food: I usually feel fine. Most food is safe to eat. Even if it's something as gnarly as the Gravy Candy Cane, I'm just glad the worst part's over with.\nThe Burger King Halloween Whopper is an exception to this rule. In truth, it has a dark secret.\nWell, in truth, it's hardly a secret. It's the bun we're talking about. It's unnaturally black. You can clearly see the company went all out with the food coloring to make sure it has a jet black sheen.\nThe hidden truth, though, is what comes after you eat it.\nI first noticed something was amiss while trying to look up the initial press release for some background info and saw something curious pop up under the suggested searches in Google.\nOH CRAP WHAT HAVE I DONE I CAN'T TURN BACK NOW pic.twitter.com/AG4u7TotPP\nâ€” Nicholas O'Malley (@nickjomalley) September 29, 2015\nAt that point, I had already eaten the sandwich, and had already doomed myself to whatever fate would eventually befall me.\nIn the coming days and weeks, many consumers will take to the internet to try to find some concrete info surrounding the search term \"Halloween Whopper green poop.\" Having eaten said sandwich, I can say three things.\nThe foods you eat have a significant impact on your digestive system, particularly when it comes to artificial additives and what passes through your body. The black bun on the Halloween Whopper is clearly dyed with food coloring to achieve that black look. I have good reason to suspect that, since there's really no truly black dye, that the coloring of the bun is achieved by using a heavy amount of dark green dye. You have been warned. Eat with caution.", "external_links": ["http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-75766d82917fca9a.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/taste-testing-burger-kings-halloween-themed-black-whopper-2b16366f93a0c0ac.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-75766d82917fca9a.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-26c5987eae7ef5b9.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-9c928a4a11f5cffc.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-26c5987eae7ef5b9.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-d8dcecabf2f27ead.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-b6cf6c2e9d2d1abd.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-c2541310418b437a.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-488d76686f5b8e5f.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-488d76686f5b8e5f.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-8a279237d6cc026b.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-d8dcecabf2f27ead.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-6adae3d01d29a47e.jpg", "http://connect.masslive.com/user/ShainaMishkin/photos.html", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-c04590989f25898c.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-c2541310418b437a.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-963da39d8e442b5f.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-b6cf6c2e9d2d1abd.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-55522fea77d4eb05.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-963da39d8e442b5f.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/taste-testing-burger-kings-halloween-themed-black-whopper-2b16366f93a0c0ac.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-26c5987eae7ef5b9.jpg", "http://t.co/AG4u7TotPP", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-8a279237d6cc026b.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-b6cf6c2e9d2d1abd.jpg", "http://www.masslive.com/food/2015/10/burger_king_halloween_whopper.html", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-014158bb934a2bb1.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/taste-testing-burger-kings-halloween-themed-black-whopper-2b16366f93a0c0ac.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-9c928a4a11f5cffc.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-d8dcecabf2f27ead.jpg", "https://twitter.com/nickjomalley/status/648961326388224000", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-6adae3d01d29a47e.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-c04590989f25898c.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-75766d82917fca9a.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-014158bb934a2bb1.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-9c928a4a11f5cffc.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-963da39d8e442b5f.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-54d9f58eefb64826.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-c04590989f25898c.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-6adae3d01d29a47e.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-014158bb934a2bb1.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-54d9f58eefb64826.jpg", "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-54d9f58eefb64826.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgthumb/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-55522fea77d4eb05.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-55522fea77d4eb05.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-8a279237d6cc026b.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-488d76686f5b8e5f.jpg", "http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/pgfull/img/republican/photo/2015/09/30/-c2541310418b437a.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:28:14.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
