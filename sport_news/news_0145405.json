What is a crisis? Football is not in a crisis.” \nBlatter in May 2011 amid an earlier major corruption scandal. \n\n“I would deny it. There is no racism ... We are in a game, and at the end of the game, we shake hands, and this can happen, because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination.” \nBlatter sparks controversy in November 2011 when asked in a television interview if he believes there is racism in the game. \n\n“I’d say they should refrain from any sexual activities.” \nBlatter in December 2010 when asked about the 2022 World Cup being held in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. \n\n“Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball. They could, for example, have tighter shorts. Female players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so, and they already have some different rules to men—such as playing with a lighter ball. That decision was taken to create a more female aesthetic, so why not do it in fashion?” \nBlatter in 2004 talking about women’s football. \n\n“I consider myself a little bit as a godfather of the organisation of women’s football in FIFA.” \nBlatter in 2015, urging better marketing of women’s football ahead of the World Cup in Canada. \n\n“Listen, this is a special approach in the Anglo-Saxon countries. If this had happened in, let’s say, Latin countries then I think he would have been applauded.” \nBlatter says in 2010 John Terry ought not to have been sacked as England captain over an alleged affair. \n\n“Every game should have a winner. When you play cards or any other game, there’s always a winner and a loser. We should have the courage to introduce a final decision in every game of football.” \nBlatter in 2004 when proposing the possibility of abolishing draws and making goals bigger. \n\n“There are not many names the media haven’t thrown at me in the last few years. I would be lying to you if I said it did not hurt. You ask yourself: ‘What have I done?’” \nBlatter in 2014 discussing his treatment by the international media. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:16:42.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
