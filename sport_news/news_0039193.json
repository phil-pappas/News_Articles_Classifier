Chasing India’s total of 92, South Africa crossed the line with six wickets in hand, to also take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, the last of which will be played the Eden Gardens on October 8. “I don’t think we played good cricket. In the batting department, we just wanted to address run-outs and losing wickets in pairs. We didn’t improve on that. Overall, we didn’t bat well at all. It’s important to address what went wrong. You get performances like these, what’s important is how you bounce back,” Dhoni said at the post match presentation ceremony. “The calling needs to improve. At times you want to take a chance against the fielder. Sometimes you have to keep the dew factor in mind, because the ball will go to the fielder quicker,” he said. The skipper praised the team spinners for trying their best against the visitors. “There was not enough runs on the board. One thing is for sure, our spinners are bowling well, and that has been our strength. In the coming games, it is important to give some of the other guys a chance, we have some time before the World T20,” he said. “Amit Mishra is bowling really well, but looking at their batsmen, the incoming delivery is something the left-handers are good at, that’s why we went with two off spinners,” Dhoni said.
