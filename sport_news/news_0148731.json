Souhegan came in sixth. \nJust last week at the Manchester Invitational, the Astros were fourth, trailing Coe-Brown, Souhegan and Champlain Valley. \nThe Astros had an impressive pack in the race. Sophomore Maison D’Amelio led a 17-18-19 finish in 20:15.94 over the rough and hilly Thetford Academy course with freshman Jordan Vaillancourt and senior Morgan Sansing right behind. Senior Ariel Vaillancourt was 26th in 20:27.08 and freshman Ciara April was 35th in 20:45,23. \nAt Manchester last week, Jordan Vaillancourt ran in the freshman race, taking top honors, as did April. Saturday, they helped give the Astros the title in the largest field in Bernard’s 13 years as head coach. \n“Jordan’s just getting better and better but the top five all ran great today,” said Bernard. “To have them that close together was great.” \nLed by Exeter sophomore Jacqueline Gaughan, the top four runners in the girls race were from New Hampshire. Gaughan was first in 19:11.02 followed by Coe-Brown star Elisabeth Danis (19:22.90), Bedford’s Leya Salis and Merrimack Valley’s Kristie Schoffield. \nKimball takes sixth \nTimberlane senior Liam Kimball, the New Hampshire Division 1 champion last year, finished sixth overall at the Woods Trail Run, running a 16:47.52. Randy Neish of Glastonbury was first in 16:12.87 with Cameron Daly of Inter-Lakes second in 16:29.61. \nAs a team, the Owls came in 19th in the 63-team field.
