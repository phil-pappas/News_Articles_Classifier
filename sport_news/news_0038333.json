The visor Malzahn would have worn will instead be autographed and auctioned off in effort to help those in need affected by flooding in South Carolina. true â€” SEC Sports (@SEC) October 15, 2015 \n\"Coach Spurrier is one of the all-time greats and his influence on me and my coaching style goes back to my days as a high school coach when I started wearing a visor,\" Malzahn said. \"I'm very appreciative for everything he's done for me and the game of football. He's played a large role in making Southeastern Conference football what it is today and will be missed. Going visor-free for tonight's game is a small way to pay respect to Coach Spurrier and help raise money and awareness for a great cause.\" MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
