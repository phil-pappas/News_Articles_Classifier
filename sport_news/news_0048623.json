Needing an upset to gain ground in Region 5 , the Wolverines couldn’t convert and are now seventh in the region — a half-game behind three teams tied for fourth. Special photo by Cecil Copeland slideshow MARIETTA — Ninth-ranked Walton turned what was a scoreless game in the second quarter into a 49-21 blowout of Woodstock on Friday to remain one game behind Roswell in Region 5 .The Raiders (7-1, 5-1) featured a balanced offensive attack that Woodstock (4-4, 2-4) could only contain for the first quarter.Quarterback Addison Shoup finished the game 23-of-31 for 315 yards and three touchdowns, while K.K. Brooks carried the ball 18 times for 165 yards and also had three scores.Although Walton had more than 500 yards on offense, coach Maurice Dixon still found some room for improvement.“I think we played well, especially on offense,” Dixon said, “but we had too many problems with penalties and were sloppy on defense.”On Walton’s opening possession of the game, it used 15 plays to drive to the Woodstock 23-yard line, but Nick Orrell-Jones missed a 40-yard field-goal attempt.Just before the first quarter ended, the Raiders began their first scoring drive of the game, and Brooks capped a 10-play, 77-yard drive with his 16-yard touchdown run. Jones kicked the first of his six extra points to give the Raiders a 7-0 lead.After Shoup scored from 1 yard out to put Walton up 14-0, Woodstock got back in the game on a 72-yard scoring run from Jerrail McMickens. Evan Cowart’s extra point cut Walton’s lead to 14-7.That, however, was as close as Woodstock could get.Walton scored two more touchdowns in a 1:52 span just before halftime to put the game away.Shoup hit Brooks on a 56-yard touchdown pass to increase the lead to 21-7 with 1:52 left in the first half. Shoup then found Sam Letton alone in the corner of the end zone from 9 yards out with 18 seconds left until halftime, giving Walton a 28-7 advantage.Woodstock coach Brent Budde gave credit where credit was due.“That is a very good football team,” Budde said. “They did everything well (Friday). I’m still proud of our team, though. We had some offensive success, and we can learn a lot from a game like this.”Woodstock fell a half-game behind a fourth-place logjam of Cherokee, Wheeler and Milton. It won’t get any easier, with region leader Roswell coming to the Wolverine Den next week.Woodstock was led by McMickens and his seven carries for 107 yards. Quarterback Liam Byrne passed for 203 yards and two touchdowns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:28:09.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
