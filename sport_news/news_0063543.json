He didn’t face a breakpoint, and only dropped nine points on his own serve. \n“Conditions didn’t help him, didn’t help his serve,” Djokovic said. “I was feeling like I can get a lot of balls back in play and make him move, which was one of the intentions tactically in order to be successful today.” \nDjokovic moved into a semifinal match against fourth-seeded David Ferrer, who beat wild-card entry Lu Yen-hsun 6-3, 6-1 to join fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the last four. \nThird-seeded Nadal reached his first hard-court semifinal of the year by outlasting Jack Sock of the United States 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. \n\nNYC jury acquits Hawks’ Sefolosha in fracas \nNEW YORK — Atlanta Hawks player Thabo Sefolosha was acquitted of charges stemming from a struggle with police outside a trendy New York City nightclub that left him with a broken leg and ended his season. \nA Manhattan jury deliberated less than an hour before finding Sefolosha not guilty of misdemeanor obstructing government administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. He appeared to tear up when he heard the verdict and was later seen shaking hands with some of the jurors as he left court. \n“They were on the side of truth and justice today. ... I’m just happy all this is over now and I can put this behind me, knowing my name has been cleared,” the 31-year-old Sefolosha told reporters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:40:06.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
