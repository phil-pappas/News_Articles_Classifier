The latest was a three-run shot by Cespedes in the fourth inning for the New York Mets in their NL Division Series game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \nCorrea hit two of Houston's four homers against Kansas City, and the Chicago Cubs hit a postseason-record six home runs in their victory over St. Louis. Three of Toronto's first eight batters homered in an ALDS win at Texas. \nThe previous postseason record was 15 home runs on Oct. 3, 1995, according to STATS. Like Monday, there were four postseason games on that day 20 years ago. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:22:07.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
