He put the Panthers ahead to stay at 2-1 in the first period. \nJagr also had a goal and an assist, and Huberdeau assisted on Florida's first two goals. \nAl Montoya made 33 saves to improve to 2-0-0. \nJamie Benn scored both Dallas goals, increasing his total to an NHL-leading eight. \nThe Stars had a five-game winning streak snapped that had included a sweep of four road games. \nFlorida's Aaron Ekblad and Dave Bolland each scored their first goal this season. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
