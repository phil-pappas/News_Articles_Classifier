Barstow graduate Aaron Sanchez played a role in the victory. The Blue Jays rookie reliever entered the game in the seventh inning and pitched 1 1-3 innings to pick up the win. He allowed one run on two hits with a walk and strikeout. The seventh turned out to be a wild inning. The teams entered the inning tied 2-2 but the game dramatically changed in the event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning. Jose Bautista hit a three-run homer to cap the a Blue Jays comeback. In the top fo the inning the Rangers took a 3-2 lead when catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking run to score. The Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay. The Rangers started the bottom half by making three straight errors and Toronto rallied. The Blue Jays play the winner of Wednesday night's Game 5 between Houston and Kansas City. Game 1 of the ALCS is Friday night. By Ian Harrison", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:32:54.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
