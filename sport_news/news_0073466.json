Photo by Peter McIntosh. \nEldon Clifton has a new badge on his New Zealand Boxing blazer - life membership of the New Zealand Boxing Coaches Association. \nThe 56-year-old was taken by surprise when he was presented with the honour at the national boxing championships in Invercargill last week. \nInitially, he felt embarrassed and even unworthy. \nBut that's Clifton. He is one of those blokes who always struggles to say no to people and just keeps giving to the sport of boxing. \nIt has not been all one-way traffic, of course. \nClifton said boxing had enriched his life and passing on what the sport had given him to the next generation had helped keep him enthusiastic during the past 15 years. \n''When they said my name I was thinking this has to be a mistake,'' Clifton said. \n''I didn't feel I had achieved what a lot of others had achieved and I felt uncomfortable.'' \nHe still feels more comfortable sharing the honour and accepted it on behalf of all those who had helped him in his boxing and coaching careers. \n''A big chunk of this award belongs to the guys in the past who helped me. Whatever I have given or should give to young fighters ... will not repay what was gifted to me. \n''I'm not just teaching boxing, I'm teaching everything that goes with boxing. I'm teaching mutual respect for each other. I'm teaching them to win, I'm teaching them to lose. I'm teaching them about life and that is where I learnt about life. \n''I had a coach, Gary Coster, who had 20-odd boys ... and he kept us out of trouble. And he done that through having us use all our energy in the gym.'' \nClifton's own boxing career had its highs and lows. \nHe was lucky enough to train under the likes of Coster and Jacky Drew and also his uncle, Gordon Taylor, who was an enormous source of inspiration. \nClifton came very close to representing his country at the 1984 Olympics but a foot injury meant he was cut from the final squad. \nThe former lightweight boxed for New Zealand for three years from 1980 to 1983. \nHe went to Melbourne to investigate fighting professionally in 1985 but his long-term partner, Joanne Boyce, became pregnant with the couple's first child and he retired. \n''I was a little disgruntled with some aspects of boxing and when you are young you probably focus more on your failures than your successes,'' he said. \n''I teach my boys not to do that now and use that experience to pass on.'' \nClifton was lured back into the sport in 2000 when his son, Kane, wanted to box. \n''I thought he would have a couple of fights and go and play rugby or something. He fought for the next 10-plus years.'' \nKane has gone on to start his own gym in New Plymouth where he coaches boxing. \nWhen Clifton is not in the gym guiding the next generation of boxers, he is at home where he is a caregiver for four adult men with a range of disabilities. \nIt is a demanding job, the sort which keeps you busy seven days a week. \nHe would not have been able to devote the time he puts into boxing without a ''supportive whanau''. \n''Since my son has finished boxing I've tried to say, 'Well, I'm finishing next year'. What has kept me going is the boys saying, 'When are you coming to the gym to train us?'.'' \nClifton's coaching highlights include being named the South Island's most scientific trainer from 2013 to 2015 and the South Island's most successful trainer in 2011 and from 2013 to 2015. \nBut Clifton believes his greatest achievement was teaming up with Tommy Trinder to help revive boxing in Otago which had fallen into a lull around the turn of the century. \nSadly, a dispute with the Otago Boxing Association four years ago means Clifton's boxers actually fight for Manawatu. \nHowever, he remains hopeful a resolution will be reached because right next to the life membership badge on his New Zealand Boxing blazer is an Otago Boxing Association badge. \nThe OBA remains close to his heart.
