He brings some adrenaline and excitement we don't normally see in people his age to these team events. Boy, it's fun having him around. He walks in, his stories ... his excitement, his just positive nature, his ability to come up to you and tell you that he's certain -- he dreamt, he knows you're going to win your match today before you even start.\n\"It's great to have that guy who's seen a lot of rough patches in the Ryder Cup. He's seen a couple wins in the Ryder Cup and a lot of wins in the Presidents Cup. He's seen it all as far as these team events go, so you just have that ability to trust him, and we like that, so I'm excited.\"\nAdded Rickie Fowler, who has been part of the big-money games Mickelson organizes on Tuesdays during tournament weeks on the PGA Tour: \"I was definitely excited to see Phil get the nod to be coming over with us to the Presidents Cup. I know he's fired up and wants to bring the best game possible over there and be over there to help win some points.\n\"I mean, this was the first time he hasn't made a team on points since I think it was '94 or so. He brings so much to the table, probably more so off the golf course than on. We'll see. Maybe he'll step up and take care of business.\n\"I don't question him one bit. He's going to go over there and give it his all.\"\nMickelson has not won during the last two seasons on the PGA Tour, the first time that has happened in his career. The most recent of his 42 career victories on the circuit came in the 2013 Open Championship at Muirfield.\nHowever, he still can bring out his best under the bright lights, finishing second in the PGA Championship last year and tying for second in the Masters in April.\n\"Phil has made the past 20 Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup teams without needing a pick,\" said Jay Haas, who played alongside Mickelson on U.S. teams in the past. \"So if anyone deserves a pick, it's Phil Mickelson. He is without question the leader of our team in the team room, on the golf course. I think the guys trust him 100 percent.\n\"The guys on the team were adamant that Phil is the guy, and I think between the captains and team members, Phil was an overwhelming choice to be a pick. He is somebody who we all respect, and like I said, look up to, and I look for him to be a leader like he has been in the past. Can't wait for Phil to get over there.\"\nMickelson is a big reason the Americans are 8-1-1 in the Presidents Cup, as he owns a 20-16-11 record while playing in all 10 previous events, for a total of 25 1/2 points to lead all U.S. players.\nSurprisingly, he has only a 2-5-3 mark in singles, but he his 10-6-3 in foursomes and 8-5-5 in fourball, and he has been very good in the last three American victories, posting a 9-3-2 record.\nHaving Mickelson on the team gives Jay Haas some flexibility, because Mickelson can be teamed just as easily with a youngster such as Spieth or Fowler or a veteran such as Matt Kuchar or Zach Johnson.\n\"This means a lot to me,\" said Mickelson, who also has played for the U.S. in the Ryder Cup 10 times. \"I find that the team events, the Presidents Cup, the Ryder Cup, the team events are where relationships are formed. They are the most special, emotional weeks of the year.\n\"I am so honored to be on this team. My first Ryder Cup was with Jay Haas in 1995. I'm so happy to have an opportunity to play for him.\"\nThe captain obviously isn't concerned with the left-hander's age.\nJay Haas was 49, the oldest player in Presidents Cup history, when he posted a 2-1-1 record that included a 4-and-3 singles victory over Stephen Leaney of Australia to help the Americans salvage a 17-17 tie in 2003 at Fancourt in South Africa.\nSo, despite the negative blowback, Haas obviously considers a veteran such as Mickelson to be a positive.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportsxchange.com/tsxfiles/topstories", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:04:16.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
