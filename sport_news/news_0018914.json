The vote could be held as early as next year and could profoundly affect British politics and the country's place as one of Europe's economic hubs. Britain's membership of the EU has proven a divisive issue in the past, and has often led to damaging rows within the ruling Conservative Party. The \"In\" campaign will include three former prime ministers, former Labour minister Peter Mandelson, and businesswoman and Conservative House of Lords member Karren Brady among other prominent figures. The launch of \"Britain Stronger in Europe\" follows the rolling out of two campaigns for the country to leave the EU. \"Vote Leave\", including members of both the Conservative party and the main opposition Labour party, launched last week, while \"Leave.EU\" — led by the UK Independence Party (UKIP) — was unveiled in September. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has played down reports of rifts within the camp advocating a so-called \"Brexit\", saying the two campaigns are \"complementary\". He also dismissed the benefits of EU membership laid out by Rose. \"He argued that we are stronger in the world, have more influence and more clout. Has he forgotten that the United Kingdom no longer even has a seat on the World Trade Organisation and that Brussels now wants a single EU seat on the UN Security Council?\" \"The EU has a star spangled banner. He's welcome to it. I prefer the Union Jack.\" Prime Minister David Cameron, who leads the Conservative government, in 2013 promised to hold the vote amid pressure from UKIP and the eurosceptic wing of his own party. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:20:35.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
