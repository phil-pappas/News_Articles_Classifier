Now, the senior is excited to represent north Minneapolis at the next level. \n\"It means a lot because not a lot of young African Americans can make it out and go D-1, \"Johnson said. \"I feel like it represents me a lot and my community.\" \nIt's a community that's seen just a handful of athletes go division one in football in the last decade. In fact, just a few years ago North almost closed its doors for good. That's why Johnson's journey to the Gophers is bigger than just him. \n\"That was a dream school,\" Johnson said. \"Growing up I was always a Gopher fan, and I was always at their camps as a child. I just like the school spirit, and like I said -- it's a dream school.\" \nJohnson's dream come true is the product of hard work. Hours spent after school working to become the player he is today. \nAnd while chances are he won't play quarterback in college, that hard work has Johnson ready for whatever challenge Minnesota head coach Jerry Kill sends his way. \n\"They recruited me as just an athlete all around so they're expecting big things out of me,\" Johnson said. \"If coach wants me at wide receiver, I'll play receiver. If he wants me at safety, I'll go play safety. It doesn't matter.\" \nJohnson joins a recruiting class comprised of nine other Minnesota natives and includes seven of the state's top ten players. In fact, some are already calling this the best recruiting class yet under Kill. \n\"We're not only representing ourselves, but we're representing the state, \"Johnson said. \"For all of us to come together as one, big things are expected.\" Read or Share this story: http://www.kare11.com/story/sports/college/minnesota/golden-gophers/2015/10/13/north-qb-johnson-commits-to-gophers/73853762/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:43:47.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
