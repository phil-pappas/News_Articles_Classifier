TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida State University is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for possible Title IX violations in its response to sexual violence complaints.\nThe investigation by the Office for Civil Rights stems from a complaint filed with it by the accuser in quarterback Jameis Winston’s sexual assault case. Charges were not filed by the Tallahassee Police Department against the Heisman trophy winner.\nWinston was accused of sexual assault from an incident in Dec. 2012. Police decided not to press charges in Dec. 2013. The OCR will investigate all sexual assault complaints at the university during the last three years.\nThe accuser received a letter from the university in February stating that it met with Winston on Jan. 23 to investigate possible Code of Conduct violations. Winston led the Seminoles to the national championship on Jan. 6.\nTags: jameis winston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:01:34.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
