His bat, much like a delicate chip on the green, was waved with a dead hand. And the ball floated into shallow left field for a bloop hit. \nUsually, the Kansas City first baseman unloads every fraction of torque and tries — often with some level of violence — to drive the baseball. \nYet the sixth inning Friday in Game 2 of the American League Division Series required a different approach to trigger a rally and enable the Royals to nip the Houston Astros 5-4 in Kauffman Stadium. \n“I was just battling, trying not to strike out and put the ball in play,’’ Hosmer said of his encounter with Oliver Perez, the nasty Houston reliever who mixes a wicked fastball and slider. \n“That’s one thing everyone says about our team. We don’t strike out a lot, we get a lot of lucky hits and (the stab Hosmer made) might be a reason why.’’ \nThe Royals had trailed ever since the Astros made it in from New York spewing rocket fuel from their wild-card win. But in the sixth, Lorenzo Cain laced a one-out double to bring Hosmer to the plate as an 0-for-6 hitter in the playoffs. \nThat’s exactly how Hosmer looked too, getting in a hole with two strikes — hitless, and helpless. \nThen he went rogue. By simply sticking out his bat, Hosmer scored Cain. The bloop looked like a well-placed, dead-handed wedge. \n“Maybe you should tell him that,’’ Moustakas said. “He doesn’t think he can play golf.’’ \nHosmer’s dink was only the beginning to a strange frame. Kendrys Morales followed Hosmer and hit a ball into the ground that bounced right through one of the Astros’ many shifts. \nLater, with the bases loaded, Salvador Perez drew a bases-loaded walk to forge a 4-4 tie. The KC catcher walked just 13 times during the regular season, yet was issued four straight balls — the last one he barely avoided to stay off concussion protocol. \nThe momentum the Royals had lacked since the ALDS began finally shifted. A triple to begin the seventh by Alcides Escobar — what a leadoff man! — also foiled Houston’s shallow defense and was followed by an RBI single from the man built for The K, Ben Zobrist. \nWith that, and a relief trio that now goes by H-M-D, the Royals evened the series and can face Dallas Keuchel on Sunday knowing it’s not an elimination game. \n“I don’t think it has anything to do with analytics,’’ Houston manager A.J. Hinch said when asked about defensive positioning. “It has everything to do with how they did a pretty good job at finishing their at-bats. They’re a tough team to get out.’’ \nStats bear that out. The Royals struck out fewer times than any AL team. \nThat still does not account for the slight, but effective, contact on Hosmer’s hit. \n“(Perez) had him very vulnerable and it didn’t look like (Hosmer) was picking up his breaking ball,’’ Hinch said of his reliever. “For Hosmer to stay on that pitch and extend his arm and get a one-handed line drive, I’m sure Olly was surprised that the ball came off level on a line-drive trajectory and carried to the outfield.’’ \nLucky is what some call it. And the Royals will gladly take it, while recognizing the skill involved. \n“It’s a tribute to how confident and how talented a hitter (Hosmer) is,’’ Moustakas said. “You don’t see many guys able to do that, throw the bat out there when your body is out of the box pretty much, and actually put a barrel on it and get a hit.’’ \nNot convincing, like the home run Perez slammed in the second as part of a 2-for-3 performance with two RBIs, but meaningful nonetheless. \nThe crowd erupted, the bullpen got juiced and the Royals suddenly have life in this series. Enough to make a postseason upstart like the Astros question their chances. \n“After that loss, I don’t feel like mission accomplished,’’ Hinch said of splitting the first two games in KC. “We’ve got home-field advantage for the rest of this series. We’ve got to take care of business in our own backyard. But we were in position to win this game.’’ \nInstead, the Royals are in a better position to win this series. \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:43:14.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
