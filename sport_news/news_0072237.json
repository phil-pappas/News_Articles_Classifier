The NCCP would improve four watersheds, improve bridges along Interstate 25 and invest in affordable housing along I-25 from roughly Westminster to Fort Collins.\nIn total the state's $269 million request to the federal government is:\n• $91.3 million for the Resilient St. Vrain project\n• $86.9 million for the Northern Colorado Connectivity Project\n• $79.1 million to start the Colorado Resiliency Program, which will make capital investments to sure up communities against natural disasters\n• $12.8 million for administrative costs\nThe $269 million ask is being leveraged against $163.5 million in matching funds from different communities:\n• $102.7 million from Longmont and Boulder County for Resilient St. Vrain\n• $54 million for the NCCP\n• $6.9 million for the Colorado Resiliency Program\nAltogether, the state's plan would cost $432.6 million.\nLongmont City Manager Harold Dominguez said at Thursday's public hearing that the sheer amount of money available as part of the federal grant could fill a huge funding gap in the Resilient St. Vrain project.\n\"It would have a significant impact to our community and enable us to do the work we need to do and have funding available to cover that gap,\" Dominguez said. \"The funding would allow us to protect a huge number of people from floods.\"\nGaythia Weis, a Longmont resident, who talked to city and state staff about Resilient St. Vrain and Colorado's grant application said she was excited about the plans.\n\"There are really some good visionary ideas,\" Weis said.\nThe state has until October 27 to submit their phase 2 application and the grant winners will be announced in January.
