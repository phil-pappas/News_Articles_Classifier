The Lady Hoyas rallied back from the losers’ bracket to force and win a winner-take-all game against Hillgrove. Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow KENNESAW — Harrison clinched its second straight Region 4 championship after beating Hillgrove twice Thursday at Clackum Field.The Lady Hoyas had to work a little harder for this year’s crown, winning 6-5 to force a winner-take-all game with the Lady Hawks, which they won 5-2.After limping into the region tournament as loser of three of its final four regular-season games, and dropping its first-round game of the tournament, Harrison went on to win five straight through the loser’s bracket to claim the title.Harrison (21-5), which also beat Hillgrove in last year’s region championship, prevailed in dramatic fashion.Harrison led Game 1 5-0 through 4½ innings, but Hillgrove (21-10) rallied to score one in the fourth and four in the bottom of the fifth to tie. But Maddie Davenport’s two-out RBI walk in the top of the seventh plated courtesy runner Taylor Etheridge for the go-ahead run, and reliever Emily Kachel retired the side in the bottom half of the frame to seal the win and send the championship to a winner-take-all final game.In the second game, Harrison scattered five runs through six innings to build a 5-1 advantage. Hillgrove again attempted a rally, scoring a run in the bottom of the seventh off Taylor DeCelles’ two-out single, but Kachel struck out the next batter to close the door on the Lady Hawks.Harrison will host a best-of-three series against the No. 4 seed from Region 1 beginning Wednesday.Hillgrove, the region runner-up for the third consecutive year, will host the No. 3 seed of Region 1 .Kennesaw Mountain and North Cobb earned the region’s third and fourth seeds and will be on the road for the first round.“It’s pretty special to win again,” Harrison coach Matt Jones said. “I still contend that this is one of the strongest regions in the state, and to win back-to-back region championships is huge accomplishment for our program.“We lost four of our last five games before going on this run, and I told the girls afterwards that this doesn’t happen. We limped into the playoffs, and we somehow found our best softball.”Jaiden Fields’ two-out two-run home run in the third inning set the tone for Harrison in Game 1. She added another two-out RBI in the fourth, joining Davenport and Mikenzie Vaughn, who each had two-out RBIs that put Harrison in front 5-0.Hillgrove’s Mo Bastion hit into a fielder’s choice to score Dorian Edwards in the bottom of the fourth, and the Lady Hawks continued to their rally in the next inning.After Eryn Render walked to lead off the fifth, Kathryn Jackson singled and Edwards, who batted 3-for-4, hit the second of her two doubles to plate Render for a 5-2 deficit. Avery Eidson then hit a three-run homer to scored courtesy runner Grace Walker and Edwards and tied the game at 5-all.Kachel came in for Pierce Fox to limit Hillgrove’s offense and set up Harrison for a win in the seventh.Davenport was 3-for-4 with two RBIs in Game 1, while Fields batted 2-for-3 with three RBIs.Fields added to her RBI totals in the nightcap with a sacrifice fly in the first, and Jackson’s RBI single in the bottom half knotted the game at 1-all.Naila Meese homered in the second for a 2-1 Harrison advantage, and Lindley Bruce’s two-out RBI single plated Vaughn to extend the lead.A wild pitch in the sixth led to another Lady Hoyas run, and Davenport’s RBI single added to the lead, putting Harrison up 5-1.Meese, Vaughn, Davenport and Gabby Malafronte each had two hits for Harrison in the nightcap.Jackson was 2-for-4, and DeCelles batted 3-for-4 for Hillgrove.Kachel pitched 2 2/3 innings to win Game 1, then allowed two earned runs on seven hits and struck out five for the complete-game victory in Game 2.“It’s what we expect from Emily,” Jones said. “We knew Hillgrove would fight back, but she was able to shut the door and pitched a great game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:33:18.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
