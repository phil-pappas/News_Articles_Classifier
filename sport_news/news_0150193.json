Here’s a division by division look at what to expect down the road:\n • Division 1: St. John’s Prep has defeated Central Catholic and Everett, thus inheriting the mantra of favorite in the North. Despite the loss to Tewksbury, can’t overlook Andover and its passing attack. Even with some offensive woes, Xaverian is top dog in the South. Brockton and BC High are solid, but injury woes have hit both of them hard.\n • Division 2: In the South, Marshfield has proven a worthy candidate to defend its state crown. I would say Reading appears to be the team with the best shot at Marshfield, provided it gets through a competitive crop of teams in the North.\n • Division 3: Lots of teams to watch for here. In the Northeast, Tewksbury is the best bet while Beverly and Marblehead are dangerous. In the Northwest, three solid teams here with Concord-Carlisle, Melrose and Arlington. There’s lots of balance in the Southeast, with Plymouth North, Falmouth, Dighton-Rehoboth, Dartmouth and Somerset-Berkley capable of being the last one standing. The Southwest has some power with a pair of top-10 teams in North Attleboro and Duxbury. Throw in Walpole, Milton and Stoughton and you can see why there is going to be one killer quarterfinal matchup.\n • Division 4: The power lives in the South with Holliston, Middleboro and Foxboro leading the way. Keep an eye on Hanover and Westwood, both very capable of hanging with the big boys. The CAL will have a say in the North as Lynnfield, Pentucket and North Reading have separated themselves so far.\n • Division 5: The South is a strength here as well with East Bridgewater stamping itself as a favorite by virtue of an impressive road win over defending champion Abington. Undefeated Cardinal Spellman and Dover-Sherborn are two more to watch. It looks like the Catholic Central Large is going to have a say in who prevails in the North. I love the way Bishop Fenwick is playing ,and keep an eye on rapidly improving St. Mary’s.\n • Division 6: Defending champ Cohasset emerged in the South with a huge win over Mashpee. The field is also loaded with quality teams like Millis-Hopedale, St. John Paul, West Bridgewater, Nantucket and Bishop Connolly. Cathedral’s stunning loss to St. Clement gives others in the North hope. Essex Tech will be in the mix along with Boston City League schools Dorchester and Boston English.\nSweet 16\n(Last week’s rankings in parentheses)\n1. (1) XAVERIAN (4-0): Big league win over Catholic Memorial tempered by knee injury to lead back Giani Mitchell.\n2. (2) ST. JOHN’S PREP (4-0): Received a stiff challenge from Malden Catholic before prevailing.\n3. (3) MARSHFIELD (4-0): Opportunistic defense paid off in a couple of much-needed scores against Bridgewater-Raynham.\n4. (5) NORTH ATTLEBORO (4-0): Nick Rajotte was a defensive dynamo.\n5.

(9) CENTRAL CATHOLIC (3-1): Wonder if Raiders will consider using Everett Memorial Stadium as a second home.\n8. (11) TEWKSBURY (4-0): Friday Night Lights were very good to the Redmen last week.\n9. (8) ANDOVER (3-1): Stumbled against Tewksbury, but look for a bounceback.\n10.

(13) READING (3-1): Another big effort from running back D’Aundray Burcy.\n12. (4) BROCKTON (3-1): Will officially get used to life without star running back Kerry Raymond (knee).\n13. (14) MILTON (4-0): I don’t care if Natick is scuffling, any time you can get a win against a program like that, it’s a feather in your cap.\n14. (—) MELROSE (4-0): Mike Pedrini Show played to rave reviews last Friday.\n15. (10) EVERETT (1-3): Crimson Tide will get a chance to get well quickly as they get into league play.\n16.
