They will steal anything that isn’t nailed down!”\n“I must have watched a different Democratic debate. The one I watched had a proven liar, a socialist and three unknowns who were barely there. It was terrible.”\n“I just got my city water bill. They charged me $25 to pick up brush that I had cut up to their specifications. It was maybe five minutes of labor for them to pick it up. $25 is a good rate for so little work. Maybe I should go to work for the city!”\n“With Paula Deen off of ‘Dancing With the Stars’, at least now there’s one less national embarrassment!”\n“Kim Birge: Others didn’t have the opportunity you did and they didn’t steal. You did the crime, now you do the time!”\n“You think your neighbors’ barking dogs and crowing roosters are bad? My neighbors overfeed the wild birds and their cats, attracting raccoons and rats! I hear the islands have a rat problem, probably because of all the feral cat feeding stations!”\n“Hats off to everybody at the Chatham County Tag Office on Eisenhower! They handled my situation as smoothly as possible.”\n“The public should be incensed that the school board went to Jekyll Island and spent that much money on a retreat only to learn that Lockamy’s middle name is Burbank. I am a teacher and we have no books for children, I have to copy lessons off the internet and print them on a half working copier. It is unacceptable that the board places themselves above the education of the children. If they can’t act like grownups and get along, they shouldn’t be on the board. No retreat necessary!”\n“Savannah is such a wonderful place. A county clerk is a victim as she embezzles funds and a pulp fiction style robbery is under reported so as not to scare off the patrons.”\nContribute to Vox Populi by calling 912-525-0VOX (0869) or e-mailing us at vox@savannahnow.com .
