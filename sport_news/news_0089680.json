The joy of that commencement might have been somewhat deflated with the news in early September that Silverman would be suing the company she founded for wrongful dismissal.\nSitting in his MTYP office in the quirky Forks theatre that Silverman built, Felices-Luna gingerly handles the question about the institution’s impending courtroom drama.\n\"The matter is before the courts and it will be seen through,\" he says.\n\"I can tell you I still love and respect Leslee. I think she’s an artist and a visionary and, because I’m an optimist, I think once this matter has seen its way through the courts, we will be at the other side of this difficult time.\"\nAnd if Felices-Luna will be obliged to help that process, he seems confident about the task.\n\"I’m a middle child,\" he says, \"which means I’m a peacemaker.\"\nWAYNE GLOWACKI / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS\n'This is a special place and it’s so emotional to be a part of something that’s been built from the ground up to serve our audience in such a specific and beautiful way,' Pablo Felices-Luna said. Photo Store\nFor many reasons, Pablo Felices-Luna seems a perfect fit for MTYP. He has a rare combination of formidable smarts and great personal warmth. He is the father of three children, all under the age of seven, with wife Carrie Costello, herself a playwright and puppeteer.\n\"We met at the University of Victoria,\" Felices-Luna says. \"She’s from northern B.C., so she was moving to the big city in Victoria and I was moving from Lima, seven million people, to a much smaller city.\"\nGrowing up in Lima, he describes his family as \"eclectic.\"\n\"My dad is an engineer, my mom’s a social worker, my sister is a criminologist and my older brother is an exegesist,\" he says, furnishing an explanation for that last one: \"An exegesist is someone who practises exegesis, a critical interpretation of a text.\n\"Rodolfo specialized in passages of the Gospel according to John in his doctorate, so he got to do fun things like learning biblical Greek,\" he says. \"One of my favourite conversations was when we went through passages of the gospel that were written following the structure of classical Greek tragedy.\n\"It was a bit of a nerd-fest, to tell you the truth,\" he says. \"All of my siblings have ended up in Canada and my parents are still in Peru.\"\nFelices-Luna’s education included an early encounter with the Canadian mosaic.\n\"When I was 15, I went to an international school in British Columbia — 200 students living in the woods for two years in this incredible program, at one of the United World colleges, focused on creating peace and international understanding through collaboration and knowledge,\" he says.\n\"I went back home for a year and did some training with a theatre troupe there, and realized that I really wanted to train as a director. So I had the opportunity go back (to B.C.) and I did my undergraduate training at the University of Victoria, where I met my wife, then I went to Toronto to do my master’s at York.\"\nOut of school, Felices-Luna landed an important internship at Carousel Players in St. Catharines, Ont., under Kim Seledy, a frequent Silverman creative partner.\n\"As part of that internship, I got to come to MTYP for two shows (in 2002)… and it was so mind-opening,\" he says. \"It was a great six months, so I knew I wanted to work in theatre for young audiences.\n\"I ended up working in Roseneath Theatre in Toronto, which is another theatre for young audiences, with Davis S. Craig, who wrote season-opener Danny, King of the Basement. He was my mentor at Roseneath. And when Kim left the Carousel Players, the opportunity came to me to take over the company and it was a phenomenal 7&frac12; years at Carousel.\n\"And now I’m here,\" he says, recalling coming to the city to be interviewed for the job last fall.\n\"I walked out of the building and I had to call Carrie in St. Catharines and say, ‘This is really happening.’\n\"This is a special place and it’s so emotional to be a part of something that’s been built from the ground up to serve our audience in such a specific and beautiful way.\"\nIf MTYP faces challenges ahead, Felices-Luna seems excited to meet them head-on.\n\"I don’t think anybody goes into theatre to take it easy,\" he says.\nrandall.king@freepress.mb.ca\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:01:18.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
