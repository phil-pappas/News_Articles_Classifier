The work has been started after Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed and Minister for PWD, Altaf Bukhari announced Rs 50 crore for the purpose and asked officers to start the process at the earliest. The department has completed the core areas of the city like Satwari Chowk to women college, Mubarak Mandhi, Radio Station, Moti Bazaar, Purani Mandi, city chowk, Shaheedi chowk, DC Office, Residency Road, Gandhi Nagar, Green Belt and railway station Road. The work is in progress at New Plot-Janipur Road, Talab Tillo and Patta Bohri. “The work is on in full swing and I hope that the core areas of the city will be fully macadamised by November 15,” said Atul Mengi, Chief Engineer, PWD. “We have also started work during daytime, which earlier used to be done during night only. This will improve the quality of the work and also speed it up,” he added. The department will take a break after November 15, as the blacktopping cannot be done during winters. They will later cover rest of the area after March. The Darbar Move (Secretariat move from Srinagar to Jammu), which is expected in the first week of November, will also put extra burden on Jammu roads. The department has planned blacktopping the main areas before the Darbar Move. Around a million pilgrims of Mata Vaishno Devi also pass through Jammu and most of them even spend day or a couple in the city. The government has passed strict instructions with regard to the quality of the work and contactors have been communicated that any damage to the roads for three years will be their responsibility and they will have to maintain them for the period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:04:37.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
