(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Are Cubs rattled? Not really, they lost Game 1 to Cardinals too. \nCurtis Granderson never really got into the Cubs-White Sox rivalry while growing up in the south suburbs. \nThat's because the veteran outfielder didn't grow up rooting for either team and never went to a game at Wrigley Field until he was attending Illinois-Chicago. \n\"I didn't get a chance to see a bunch of games there,\" he said. \"The first game I got a chance to see was in college against the Braves. I was a Braves fan growing up. I think I went to two or three Cubs games over the course of my nonprofessional career.\" \nNow Granderson is hoping to spoil the fun for some of his old friends from Chicago, trying to prevent the Cubs from reaching their first World Series since 1945. \nGranderson helped the Mets draw first blood in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series on Saturday, driving in a pair of runs in a 4-2 victory over the Cubs before a crowd of 44,287 at Citi Field. \nMets ace Matt Harvey shackled the Cubs with two runs on four hits over 72/3 innings, starting with four perfect frames on a cool, windy night in Queens. He lived up to the hype in his duel with Jon Lester, who gave up two home runs and lost for the second time this postseason. \nLester has the only two losses in the Cubs' last 14 games. \nAll the action from Citi Field. \nKyle Schwarber, whose shot in the eighth was his fourth home run of the postseason, said the Cubs hit the ball hard off Harvey but right at people. \n\"For me it was a little surprising,\" he said. \"I know he has a pretty good fastball. He just kind of whipped out the off-speed (pitches) right away. Threw me off a little bit at first.\" \nThe first 12 Cubs hitters looked helpless against Harvey, who looked eminently capable of throwing a perfect game in the 48-degree chill. Their best chance of knocking him out came when Schwarber nearly knocked Harvey's head off with a line drive in the fourth. But Harvey ducked, and shortstop Wilmer Flores was in perfect position to snag the liner. \nLosing has become a foreign concept for these young Cubs, a bizarre change of pace for a franchise that hasn't won a World Series since 1908. They came into Game 1 with 12 victories in their last 13 games and had come from behind to win the final three games of their division series against the Cardinals. \nSo there was no panic when Harvey was dominating early, nursing a 1-0 lead on Daniel Murphy's first-inning, upper-deck homer off Lester. After Harvey plunked Anthony Rizzo with a pitch to lead off the fifth, Starlin Castro's double over the head of center fielder Juan Lagares broke up the no-hitter and changed the momentum. \nWhether Castro should have been on third was debatable because he wasn't exactly quick as a fox out of the box. Castro would have scored from third on Javier Baez's single to left if he had made it there. \nInstead, Yoenis Cespedes nailed Castro at the plate easily with a perfect throw to keep the game tied 1-1. \n\"We just took a chance to see if we could score that run,\" Castro said. \"We know, and everybody knows, (Cespedes) has a cannon.\" \nGranderson's two-out, run-scoring single to center gave the Mets the lead again, and Lester couldn't recover. \n\"We tied the game, get a little momentum on our side, and then I go right back out there and give it right back up,\" Lester said. \"That's the game right there. I have to do a better job of getting our guys back in the dugout.\" \nTravis d'Arnaud's blast to center in the sixth made it a 3-1 game, and the Cubs blew a chance in the seventh when Harvey struck out Baez and fooled pinch hitter Tommy La Stella on a changeup with two men on. \nGranderson added a run on a sacrifice fly off Lester in the seventh after Schwarber's throw from left short-hopped catcher Miguel Montero. \nThe Cubs were in the same position against the Cardinals last week, losing the first game before taking the last three, so no one seemed too rattled. \n\"That's baseball,\" Schwarber said. \"It's a crazy game.\" \nAnd it has been a crazy season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:58:06.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
