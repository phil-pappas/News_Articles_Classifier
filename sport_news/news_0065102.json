Roberto Osuna, the Blue Jays’ 20-year-old closer, was the first target; he had surrendered the winning run in a most improbable way. And when the questions started, he evinced the conflicting emotions of an entire fan base. \n“I feel sad,” Osuna said. “Happy at the same time. Sad because we’re obviously out, right? But we worked really hard this year and I’m happy with what we did all year.” \nRuss Martin, the veteran Canadian catcher, patiently answered questions en français , then answered anew in English. He saw silver linings in a heartbreaking loss. \n“We had a tremendous year,” Martin said. “We didn’t have the finish we wanted, but we’re going to hold our heads high. I’m proud of this group. I’m proud of how we fought.” \nBen Revere, who had made a sensational catch, was angry about a late and sudden expansion of the strike zone that dispatched him to the bench in a pivotal moment. Jose Bautista, a heroic catalyst in a losing cause, lamented the home run, controversially caught by a Royals’ fan, which might not have been a home run at all. \nJosh Donaldson embraced one teammate after another, squeezing so tight as to leave them breathless. For what seemed a very long time, Troy Tulowitzki sat silently at a table and stared into space. Mark Buehrle tossed his equipment bag over his shoulder and left the room with a smile, shouting, “See you guys in spring training,” which was a classic Buehrle put-on because even he does not know what he’ll be doing in February. \nFinally, the room began to empty, leaving only players and a few lingering reporters. It got quiet enough to hear Chris Colabello speak as he sat with Tulowitzki and several teammates. \n“I really wanted to play baseball on my birthday,” Colabello said. \nColabello turned 32 on Saturday. Had the Blue Jays beaten the Royals on Friday night, his wish would have been granted in a seventh game of the American League Championship Series. Instead, the Jays lost 4-3 and watched the Royals celebrate their return to the World Series for a second straight year. \n*** \nBy now, most baseball fans know how it ended – how Lorenzo Cain sprinted all the way home from first base on a single into the right-field corner by Mike Moustakas, whose wide turn at first base encouraged Bautista to throw to second instead of hitting the cutoff man for a relay to the plate in the eighth inning, and how the Jays had runners on first and third with none out in the ninth but could not score against the indomitable Wade Davis. \nAs the clubhouse post-mortems waned, the sharp edges on the players’ emotions started to soften. This was less a crushing defeat than a deep disappointment. As Colabello observed, no one expected to lose and no one wanted it to end, but everyone understood that the Jays’ beguiling run of 2015 could be just the beginning. \n“I don’t feel there are any changes to be made as far as how our team is built,” Martin said. “I felt like we had a great team. I felt like we were a complete team.” \nBut in four of the six ALCS games, the Royals were a more complete team, and a better team too. While the Jays stranded runners galore, the K.C. lineup strung hits together. The Royals pitched better. Their deep, dazzling bullpen made the difference in Game 6. That, and their speed and resourcefulness. \n“It was an unconventional way to score a run,” manager Ned Yost said of Cain’s three-base sprint. “But that was Royals’ baseball. We did it on speed and athleticism.” \nAccording to several reports, their scouts and coaches noticed subtle changes in David Price’s delivery when he threw his changeup; their batters benefited. And they were alert to taking an extra base, as Cain did, because they knew that Bautista typically throws to second base in situations like the one that developed in the eighth inning. \nMore than an hour after the game ended, general manager Alex Anthopoulos, AGM Tony LaCava and scouting director Perry Minasian sat in the manager’s office chatting with John Gibbons. They had desperately wanted the magic to continue, but their mood was far from morose. They had taken this team from abject mediocrity to excellence, and doing that gave them the confidence and motivation to take it further next year, assuming the new boss, Mark Shapiro, has the same confidence in them that they have in themselves. \nThe Jays’ biggest questions for 2016 focus on pitching. Bringing back David Price is a longshot, both in terms of salary and contract length. Marco Estrada, a splendidly surprising starter this year, is a free agent who will seek a multi-year deal. How do the Jays respond? Do they exercise their US$12-million option on knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, who turns 41 this week? Buehrle, who was very good in about half of his starts, will not be back. Who fills that gap? Are Osuna and Aaron Sanchez starters or relievers? Whatever the answer to that one, bullpen vacancies loom. \n*** \nDonaldson, the intense, fun-loving, scholarly hitter whose performance and leadership helped drive this train, believes that the experience of 2015 helped the Jays learn much about pulling together and winning. Many of them, especially the younger players, had never experienced a pennant race. \n“We don’t feel great about the situation now,” he said, “but give it some time to breathe a little bit. Coming into spring training next year, I feel like we’re going to have some momentum. There’s been a lot of learning throughout this season for a lot of guys, including myself. It can only make you better.” \nColabello, a minor-league nomad called up in May out of dire necessity, was a revelation to all but himself. He posted a .321 average during the regular season and collected 11 hits, including a homer, in the playoffs. Like other Jays in the playoffs for the first time, Colabello found a new taste that made him hungrier. \n“It’s a great group,” he said. “It’s the most fun I ever had playing. I’m going to remember it for a long time and hopefully get back here.” \nAnd perhaps get to play baseball on his birthday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:18:11.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
