(AP) — The New York Jets have signed wide receiver Kenbrell Thompkins to the practice squad, and released wide receiver-kick returner Walter Powell from the practice squad. \nThompkins was signed by New England as an undrafted free agent out of Cincinnati in 2013 and he caught 32 passes for 466 yards and four touchdowns as a rookie. He played in two games the following season before being released and then claimed off waivers from Oakland. \nThompkins had 15 catches for 209 yards in 12 games with the Raiders last season, but was cut before the start of this season. New England re-signed him to the practice squad last month, and released him last week. \nPowell had been with the Jets since last season, when New York claimed him off waivers from Arizona. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:23:41.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
