Bill Wagner Contact Reporter bwagner@capgaznews.com \"We literally and figuratively submerged and Chet threw us a lifeline,\" \nWhen Tulane and Navy meet on the football field this Saturday afternoon it will mark an anniversary of sorts and bring back memories of how one institution helped another at a time of crisis. \nTulane's most recent appearance in Annapolis was 10 years ago and came courtesy of the Naval Academy Athletic Association. The Green Wave and Midshipmen last met at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium on Nov. 5, 2005 – just three months after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans. \nTulane University shut down for four months because of extensive damage to the campus, not to mention the overall infrastructure of the entire city. Athletic director Rick Dickson convinced school president Scott Cowen that playing football and other sports during the fall semester would be a positive. \n\"I just felt athletics could serve a purpose and perhaps provide some sort of morale boost by sticking together and continuing to represent Tulane and New Orleans,\" Dickson said. \nDickson established an office at Conference USA headquarters in Dallas while the football program relocated to Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. Initially, Dickson's plan was to have the Green Wave only play their conference contests due to severe financial constraints. Thomasson filling key need on defense (Bill Wagner) \nDickson called Naval Academy athletic director Chet Gladchuk to tell him the football team probably was not capable of coming to Annapolis in November. Gladchuk, who was athletic director at Tulane from 1987-1990, immediately put his colleague's mind at ease. \n\"Chet completely understood the hardships we were enduring and was the first one to step up and offer assistance. That is something that will never be forgotten by me,\" Dickson said. \nGladchuk told Dickson during that telephone conversation the Naval Academy Athletic Association would completely cover the cost of Tulane's trip to Annapolis. Without hesitation, Gladchuk offered to pay for the team's flight, hotel accommodations, ground transportation meals and other miscellaneous expenses.

All you have to worry about is getting your football team to the airport.' Chet and his people at Navy made it easy,\" Dickson said. \nSeveral other schools that were due to host Tulane that season followed Navy's lead and the football team was able to fulfill its entire schedule as a result. The Green Wave were vagabonds, playing 11 games in 11 weeks in 11 different stadiums. A talented team that returned 44 letterman and 17 starters wound up finishing 2-9 as injuries to key players and the effects of being dislocated eventually took a toll. \nOne of the more lopsided losses of that difficult season came against Navy as quarterback Lamar Owens directed a rushing attack that rolled up 418 yards in a 49-21 win. Tulane star running back Matt Forte, now a two-time Pro Bowl performer with the Chicago Bears, was held to just 14 rushing yards in the loss. \nTulane athletics in general and the football program in particular have come a long way in the decade since. \nInitially, Dickson was forced to eliminate half of the varsity athletic programs – choosing to field only football, basketball and baseball on the men's side with five women's sports (volleyball, basketball, cross country, indoor and outdoor track and field) providing balance for Title IX purposes. \n\"The university was in survival mode and the primary focus was to rebuild the campus,\" said Dickson, noting that Tulane laid off half its faculty and administration. \nDickson was eventually given permission to bring back the cut sports incrementally and Tulane now fields 15 varsity programs. Football, which struggled to recruit for a long time after Hurricane Katrina, has managed just one winning season since the storm. \nChris Scelfo, who compiled a 37-57 record in eight seasons, was fired following the 2006 campaign. Bob Toledo, the head coach at UCLA from 1996 through 2002, was brought in to rebuild the program. \n\"I knew I was not going to be around to nurture a young coach so I needed an experienced veteran at that time,\" said Dickson, noting that Toledo had also been head coach at California-Riverside and Pacific. \nDickson was referring to the fact he has spent considerable time traveling for purposes of fundraising ever since Hurricane Katrina. In a recent interview, Dickson said he still spends the majority of each week on the road due to the reality that 82 percent of Tulane graduates live outside the state of Louisiana. \nDickson's efforts have paid great dividends and enabled Tulane to spend $175 million to build brand new athletic facilities or refurbish old ones. It marks the greatest investment in athletic infrastructure since Gladchuk oversaw a $25 million campaign that led to construction of the Wilson Center athletics administration building as well as new facilities for the baseball, tennis and track and field teams. \nFor Dickson, the crown jewel is Yulman Stadium, the first on-campus football facility at Tulane in 40 years. Built at a cost of $73 million and opened on Sept. 6, 2014, Yulman Stadium has a capacity of 30,000 and features two elevated club decks on the home side. It was named in honor of lead donor Richard Yulman, the retired chairman and owner of mattress manufacturing giant Serta International. New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson was another major benefactor and the field bears his name. \n\"We spent many years forging through the darkness in the wake of the Katrina tragedy,\" Dickson said. \"In my view, Yulman Stadium is the symbolic stake in the ground that it's all over! Not only has the stadium transformed the football program, it has energized the whole campus.\" \nTulane, which played home games at the Louisiana Superdome from 1975 through 2013, was able to triple its football revenues last season as a result of Yulman Stadium. \n\"We now have 30,000 people coming on campus for football games, tailgating beforehand and creating a tremendous collegial atmosphere,\" Dickson said. \nToledo resigned as head coach in the middle of the 2011 season, but not before bringing some stability to the football program. \"Bob did a lot of good things and laid a solid foundation,\" Dickson said. \nTo take the program forward, Dickson hired Curtis Johnson – a 53-year-old New Orleans native with national championship and Super Bowl rings. Johnson was the wide receivers coach at the University of Miami from 1996 to 2005 and held the same position with the New Orleans Saints from 2006 through 2011. \n\"Curtis Johnson is a man of impeccable character and integrity. He has demonstrated a remarkable knack to evaluate, recruit and develop talented young men to their maximum capacity as both student-athletes and professionals at the highest level. He is a leader, motivator and effective teacher, who diligently strives for excellence. His relentless will to win makes him the right man for Tulane,\" Dickson said on the day the school's 39th head coach was introduced. \nLast year, Tulane joined the American Athletic Conference, which Dickson believes was another significant step forward. The Green Wave appeared on national television a total of 26 times during their last 10 years in Conference USA. That number jumped to 69 in the first nine months of competition in the AAC. \n\"I believe the invitation to join the American was validation that Tulane athletics is moving in the right direction. It punctuated that we are headed to a higher level,\" Dickson said. \nIn many respects, the road to recovery began with an act of kindness from the Naval Academy Athletic Association a decade ago. \n\"We were like a midshipman lost overboard. We were literally and figuratively submerged and Chet threw us a lifeline,\" Dickson said. \"We were able to scramble back aboard and get both feet on the ship.\" \nGladchuk said the offer to pay Tulane's expenses for that 2005 football game was the least he could do for a colleague he greatly admires and a university for which he has fond memories. \n\"There is no one in the business that I respect more than Rick Dickson,\" Gladchuk said. \"Rick has been incredibly loyal and committed to Tulane University. He had many opportunities to go elsewhere, but stuck it out through the toughest of times and displayed tremendous leadership in getting the athletic department back on solid ground.\" \n2014 Record: 3-9 overall, 2-6 conference \nTULANE AT GLANCE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:25:00.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
