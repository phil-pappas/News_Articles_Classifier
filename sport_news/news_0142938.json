The Pirates went down in order in the bottom of the 4th and Arrieta has now retired 11 in a row. \nIt's hard to believe that a season with 98 wins may not be remembered as a success but there are some that will. \nAfter three innings, Chicago 3, Pittsburgh 0 \nThe Hurdle gambit to start Sean Rodriguez at first base for defensive purposes ended in the bottom of the third when Pedro Alvarez pinch hit for Rodriguez and then stayed in to play first base. Arrieta, though, made the defense/offense strategy meaningless though as, pitching with a three-run lead, he struck out the side. \nInterestingly, the Pittsburgh Police boat was just patrolling under the Clemente Bridge. It appeared that it was routine and not because of any jumpers. Yet \nAfter two and a half innings: Chicago 3, Pittsburgh 0 \nJoe Maddon gambled and put Kyle Schwarber in right field despite limited experience there because Maddon wanted his offense. After an RBI single in the first, Schwarber added a two-run homer deep to right field in the third and Maddon looks like a genius. \nAfter two innings, Chicago 1, Pittsburgh 0 \nBoth pitchers settled down in the second and neither team recorded a hit. \nAfter one inning: Chicago 1, Pittsburgh 0 \nDon Larsen fans can relax - there will be no perfect game tonight. Andrew McCutchen singles in the Pirates first but gets no further. \nAfter one half inning: Chicago 1, Pittsburgh 0 \nFinally, the hoopla ended, and the baseball started. It didn't start well for the Pirates, though. Dexter Fowler singled to center field, stole second on the next pitch, and scored on a single by Kyle Schwarber - one of the players Joe Maddon started for his offense. After a double play, Anthony Rizzo reached on an error by Neil Walker - despite the Pirates stressing defense in this lineup. Cole struck out Tommy La Stella looking to end the inning. \nIn the pregame, Maddon stressed the importance of getting an early lead with his offensive lineup, and it happened. Hurdle stressed defense and didn't get it... but there are 8 1/2 innings yet to play. \nAndrew McCutchen's mom did a great job on the national anthem, and the crowd erupted when Jung Ho Kang was wheeled onto the field in a wheelchair. \nBob Walk just threw out the first pitch, so it's only minutes until the first pitch. Now, there's a video about past Pirates successes, narrated by Michael Keaton - the other Batman with Pittsburgh connections. \nThere have only been four wild card games in the history of the National League – and this will be the third to be played in Pittsburgh. The game features a classic matchup of offense versus defense. Pirates manager Clint Hurdle has structured his lineup to maximize defensive efficiency – starting Sean Rodriguez over Pedro Alvarez or Aramis Ramirez at first base. Cubs manager Joe Maddon has structured his lineup to maximize its offensive potential – starting Kris Bryant in left field and Kyle Schwarber in right field, not the positions they played in the regular season. \nAll the lineup tinkering has been magnified because there seems to be little room for error in the pitching matchup. The Cubs are starting Jake Arrieta, who has turned in the most dominating second half in history and the Pirates started Gerrit Cole, who won 19 games and has been the ace of the Pirates staff all year. \nAfter each team played 162 games hoping to avoid playing in a sudden-death matchup, it's time to play it anyway. They're introducing the entire rosters now so action should start soon. \nLet's follow the action with updates every inning - or half inning if it's worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:26:01.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
