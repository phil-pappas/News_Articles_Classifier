The hits keep coming for the Bruins in the opening days of the season. \nWhile Chara’s potential return Monday from an upper-body injury would help a group that’s trying to stop the bleeding defensively (10 goals allowed in two games), now the questions about the offense might begin. \nLosing Marchand to a concussion that will keep him out indefinitely breaks up one of the few sure things the Bruins have at this point. An offense that has underwhelmed while integrating new players (four goals in two games) will see its most familiar duo separated. Patrice Bergeron and Marchand were the team’s only linemates this season that had spent significant time together (at least 150 even-strength minutes) prior to this season. \nWith Marchand out, Loui Eriksson will move from the right side to replace him as Bergeron’s left wing. Brett Connolly, coming off two games with what’s been a bad third line with Ryan Spooner and Jimmy Hayes, was moved up to Bergeron’s right in Sunday’s practice. The B’s already needed increased scoring to put less onus on the defense and Tuukka Rask . Now it will be even harder to get. \n“We have to create chances and score goals,” Eriksson said Sunday. “We need to do a better job with that. Obviously we’re not getting any lucky bounces now, either. We hit a crossbar and a post [Saturday against the Canadiens] and obviously they disallowed a goal, but we’ve just got to keep on working hard. Hopefully we’ll get some bounces and some good goals.” \nEriksson is the only Bruin with a positive Corsi (team shot attempts) in even strength through two games (plus-8 Corsi). Fourth-liner Joonas Kemppainen, who was sat for Saturday night’s game, had a plus-1 Corsi in the season opener but was unremarkable in his NHL debut. Kemppainen will likely re-enter the lineup to see if he can build on a strong preseason. \nChris Kelly will have to come to the rescue of Spooner’s line, a group that has struggled with puck possession and has been passive in the defensive zone. Connolly said that he, Spooner and Hayes could be better if reunited. Julien would need to see a lot more. In assessing the line’s play, he did everything but call the trio soft. \n“I think they’ve got to be a little heavier as a line,” Julien said. ”I [feel] that they’re losing too many battles. Because of that, they’re not spending enough time and having opportunities to create enough. In order to be successful, you’ve got to win those battles for pucks and races and be strong on them. I think that as a line, they needed to be better there. \n“They’ve got the skill level. I think there’s a lot. There’s size, and you look at Hayes who does a great job going to the net. He’s got a great shot. He scored 19 goals last year; he’s got that ability. Same thing with Brett Connolly. He can skate, he can do a lot of things. Spoons, we know how skilled he is. Right now, it’s just a matter of probably getting a little bit harder on pucks and more determined to win more battles than losing them.” \nWhen Don Sweeney shuffled the team’s forwards in the offseason, the intention was to have a balanced scoring attack. Beleskey, Hayes, a more familiar Connolly and a more experienced David Pastrnak should all add to a group that finished 22nd in goals last season, but the team’s scoring will also be dependent on better defense and better puck possession. \nThe brightest spot offensively for the Bruins thus far has been David Krejci ’s line. Beleskey hasn’t been anything to write home about through two games, and he was the victim of a bad illegal check to the head call Saturday against the Habs. Krejci has been dominant at times, while Pastrnak looks more comfortable and every bit as creative as he was late last season. \nWhen used with Torey Krug's pairing with Adam McQuaid, the Krejci line is capable of lengthy stays in the offensive zone. Due to Boston's injuries, however, Julien has had to use them against better players than he'd like them to face. The trickle-down effect of not having Chara cannot be overstated. \nWith Marchand out, Pastrnak can expect to see more time on the power play after picking up an assist on Bergeron’s goal on the man advantage in the final minute of Saturday’s loss. That he was left off it early was surprising, but it appears he will play the half wall on the second power play unit going forward. He may have to split reps with Connolly in that role. \nThe Bruins’ top priority has to be tightening up defensively, but their offense won’t easily withstand the loss of Marchand. It could end up being a -- stop me if you’ve heard this before -- work in progress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:42:49.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
