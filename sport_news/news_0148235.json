T2 IS ROLLED BACK IN HANGAR STORY: The British America's Cup challenger, Land Rover BAR (Ben Ainslie Racing) has launched its latest yacht, the T2, at their base in Portsmouth, England. It is the next stage in the testing programme that the team hopes will culminate in the design and build of the final race yacht to challenge for the America's Cup in 2017. The team claims that T2 flies on foils the size of a wakeboard, while lifting the weight of a London taxi. The team principal and skipper is Ben Ainslie, four times Olympic gold medallist and who helped Oracle Team USA recover from an 8-1 deficit to beat Emirates Team New Zealand 9-8 in the previous America's Cup in 2013. BAR was launched on June 10, 2014 with the long-term aim of challenging for Britain and bringing the America's Cup back home to where it all began in 1851. Britain has never won the America's Cup. BAR have built a new headquarters in the centre of Portsmouth on the south coast of England and plans to continue test sailing in the Solent, the waters off the coast of Portsmouth, throughout the winter. Next week, the team will fly to Bermuda, the venue for the 2017 America's Cup, for the final America's Cup World Series event of the year.
