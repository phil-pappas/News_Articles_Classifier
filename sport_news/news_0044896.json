Oregon has its work cut out for it.\nDating to its appearance in the College Football Playoff semifinal on Jan. 1, Oregon is 4-4 in its last eight games, an inconsistent stretch that's left the Ducks 1-2 in Pac-12 Conference play entering Saturday's road game at Washington.\nThe Ducks hold an 11-game win streak over the Huskies, but UW has two extra days of rest to prepare after knocking off USC, on the road, on Thursday evening. Early betting lines suggest the Huskies are now two-point favorites.\nHere are Helfrich's comments from Sunday:\nWhat were you pleased with and what was disappointing when you watched the film?\nPleased with just how hard we played. We played hard in every phase, did a lot of good things that way. That's a huge deal of just, you know, first and foremost we want to be a team that plays hard, that plays physically and finishes. Then after that there's, again, a million little details, whether it's just awareness of the situation, red zone, down and distance, where can I press, where's my leverage, all those things pop up in a game like this. Whether it's the first drive, the first touchdown, the two clutch drives to end both halves -- those are things we need to close out and finish better, as coaches first and players second. A million things come up and it's one or two plays in this game that if you finish the game's over. There's one or two plays going back to the Michigan State game and everybody is singing a different tune.\nHow do you manage the psyche of the team?\nTalk about it. If everybody is on board to continue to do the things that we've done well and improve the things that we haven't done well, win, lose or draw that's the goal. ... You continue to work and you continue to count on the character of our team, the character of our coaches, the development that is taking place. That turns into experience and at some point you're off and running.\nWas safety Reggie Daniels missing for discipline or injury related reasons?\nHe wasn't available this week.\nWhat's different about bouncing back from this loss than others, if anything?\nAll you can do is commit to improvement and commit to each other. Our guys started to do that in the locker room last night. Talking to the guys today, talking to all of the people in our program, you're not happy about everything but the response is productive. There's obviously going to be some tweaks and changes from a week to week standpoint and continue to improve. We have improved and played better in a lot of areas, but not enough to get it done.\nSeveral recent teams all went 8-5 after losing the Heisman Trophy winner. Did you think this would be a rebuilding year or that you could plug in Vernon Adams and all would be well?\nI'm never, ever going to think anything but just what we control and what's next. Whether that's the next position in at a position or whatever, we expect him to be great, to play great, to prepare great. At no point ever do we sit here and go, 'We don't have A, B or C so it's OK to ... ' That just doesn't happen.\nHow do you improve the passing game?\nIn some cases, and this is all coaching based, some plays there was something there to be had. A couple times we had some route depth issues that are easily correctable. We made a couple plays, had a turnover. All those little details that are highlighted and talked about all the time, they come ablaze in a game like this to an inexperienced guy. Whether it's footwork, eye progression, all those things you have to trust and make happen in a game just like you have in training.\nThe defense played well except for allowing touchdowns on Washington State's final drive of each half. What was different on those drives?\nA couple times execution, a couple times that we could have put them in better situations, a couple times we had communication -- when I say a couple times, a couple plays -- a couple times they made a great throw and catch. We create pressure and try to put them in a hole, I called a timeout to keep the option to get the ball back. Clock would have run out on that. You bunch all that up together and you work on each facet of those things individually.\nHow do you deal with the pressures of coaching, when you see what's happening at Maryland and USC today?\nWork. And get around a bunch of guys that I totally believe in and trust. That's coaches and players and everybody in the program and you work to fine-tune it. Whether it's offense, defense, special teams, morale, you know all the things that go into this,you work. The business is the business, as you alluded to and that is completely out of our control from that standpoint but how we react to yesterday, how we react and come to work tomorrow, that matters a ton.\nWhat were your impressions of Charles Nelson's debut at safety ?\nHe did some really good things and he did some things that he'll improve. I think he ran around great, obviously had a couple big-time hits that got it going. He needs to wrap up a couple of other times. He plays so fast that a guy like is going to miss some tackles by virtue of how hard he plays. And then confidence, of the position and communication and immediately knowing what to do, whether it's based on some defenses are based on the personnel or the hashmark or the strength of the formation, just becoming second nature.\nIt appeared Vernon Adams looked better in warmups. Has he made significant progress since the Utah game?\nSince the Utah game. I think so. I think that's the magic word is significant, in quotation marks or italics or what going forward. I don't know the answer to what.\nHow do Taj Griffin and Royce Freeman complement each other in the backfield?\nJust a big-time change of pace though I think Royce can run a little bit faster than I think people give him credit for and I think Taj can be a very physical guy when the time is right. I think they complement one another very well. What I talked about last week, just learning everything â€” positionally, protections, route-running, aiming points all those things he'll continue to improve.\nWhat's it going to take to be able to sustain a winning streak?\nOne win. One win. ... One at a time. Everytime that something happens great or happens not great, that's something you need to put in your memory bank and learn from. That's experience. We're learning a lot of things we want to sustain certainly and we're building a few bullet points that we need to improve upon. Anytime we make a correction or improvement or adjustment those should last forever.\nWith safety Reggie Daniels unavailable it doesn't look like you guys have anyone who's been in the secondary more than three years. How does that affect the play?\nWell it's certainly a factor. It's one of those things where great teams have talent, experience and depth and you can't manufacture any of those things. Nobody wants to hear about time and those are excuses and it's totally understandable and that's where we have to coach them. We have to put them in a great position and they have to build confidence by what happens and if it's something not good you learn from it and flush it and if it's good you keep it with you. That's where, again, you just can't manufacture these third-and-nine and giving up a 38-yard pass, the red zone, all these things that you hammer home constantly until it happens in a game. Until it happens in a game, I don't want to say it's meaningless but getting those guys to trust those things is a process.\nSecondary coach John Neal has said he appreciates how positive you are in practices. How are you going to create that positive vibe after a loss this week?\nAgain the only thing we can concentrate on are the solutions. It's very easy to sit here and put at what's wrong and put directly at me, 100 percent, but we have to be in the solution business. When we deal with our team or our guys, however it is, is what can we do now. What's next. Because the negativity will take care of itself. As far as execution and all that, there's a million things we're absolutely not pleased with but now what. Again, our character of our team and how they've worked and all those things, I'm absolutely 100 percent confident they'll come out and prepare great.\n-- Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/andrewgreif"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:28:03.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
