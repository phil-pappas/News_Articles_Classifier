The Hornets beat the Clippers 106-94 yesterday. \nIt will be the sixth NBA preseason game to be staged in Shanghai since 2004 when its homegrown star Yao Ming led the Houston Rockets against the Sacramento Kings at home. \nThe local enthusiasm was evident as the Clippers and Hornets were mobbed by huge groups of followers waving banners upon their arrival yesterday. \nThe Hornets’ newly-signed guard Jeremy Lin, who is warmly applauded wherever he appears, has transformed the franchise’s first China adventure into a sensation. \n“I am just thankful for this. I come back to China almost every summer. Every time they have treated me very well,” said the 27-year-old who enjoys an emotional tie with Chinese fans because of his family’s roots in the country. \nJoining Lin on the Hornets roster are 2013-14 All-NBA Third Team forward Al Jefferson, rising star guard Kemba Walker and prolific forward Nicolas Batum, who was signed from the Portland Trailblazers. \nJefferson said he’s impressed by Lin’s popularity in China. “I feel like I’m around a rock star with him over here ... it’s amazing,” said the 30-year-old. \nOn the Clippers’ side, a full roster featuring All-Star guard Chris Paul, high-flying dunker Blake Griffin and top center DeAndre Jordan will return to Shanghai after their first visit during the 2012 preseason tour against the Miami Heat. \n“I am just excited to be back. I think a trip like this is always great for guys to get opportunities to know each other better,” said Paul, who embraced nine new teammates in the offseason. \nBefore the on-court action tips off on Wednesday night, the Fan Appreciation Day, a free interactive event presented by Dongfeng Nissan, will be staged at Shanghai’s Oriental Sports Center tomorrow. \nIn addition to open practices and on-court scrimmages by both teams, the event will see NBA legends Dell Curry, Ron Harper and Glen Rice take the last 10 shots of the “Shoot Two Million Hoops,” a mass fitness event initiated by the Shanghai Sports Bureau, as part of the NBA support to the bureau to promote sports participation and youth development. \nThe FAD will conclude a series of grassroots events jointly held by the NBA and the bureau, highlighted by the visit of Minnesota Timberwolves’ shooting guard Zach LaVine in the summer, to promote fitness. \nDespite the festive atmosphere, both teams approached their workouts seriously, trying to build chemistry within new rosters while increasing the intensity of physical contact. \n“We don’t want to practice contact today, but we are not going to have a sluggish workout,” said Clippers head coach Doc Rivers, who first coached in China in LA’s preseason games against Miami in 2012. \nHis Hornets counterpart Steve Clifford concurred: “Practice is not just about putting on a show — we have to get better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:46:10.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
