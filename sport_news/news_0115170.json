And Blashill expressed confidence, starting with a game tonight against the Oilers before back-to-backs Friday and Saturday against the Flames and Canucks.\n“This is a small sample size,” Blashill said. “I think we’ll be fine.\n“We’ve just got to keep getting better at it.”\nAttacking the schedule \nA lot goes into a long trip for a sports team.\nScheduling of practices and meals, sleep and conditioning and when to arrive where, and how, is important.\nAnd it all requires some consideration, especially by a coach, working with the captain and the players and his assistants, and folks in the front office.\nWill Blashill do anything differently from Mike Babcock , coach for the extended excursions of the previous decade?\n“It’s hard for me to say, exactly,” said Blashill, who traveled with Babcock and the Wings for only a season before heading to journeys on buses in the American Hockey League as coach in Grand Rapids.\n“I think those are decisions you continue to make,” he said, of becoming accustomed to his players, and vice versa. “And you hope you make more right ones than wrong ones.\n“For us, we’ll attack it. We’ll skate tomorrow, as a pregame,” he said, of scheduling a morning skate before the night game.\n“Thursday, we’ll make a decision,” he said, of the possibility of scheduling a practice on the day off before the back-to-back.\n“But those are the decisions you make as you move forward.”\nPerks of winning \nJustin Abdlekader , who is scoring big, won the award for the best costume at the team Halloween party.\nHe credited the brainstorm of dressing as an avatar, in part, to his girlfriend.\nSome of the blue paint required for the regalia remained on his side, said the former Spartans star.\nWhen a scribe suggested it might be evidence he had decided to “go blue” after all, Abdelkader smiled and did not miss a beat.\n“Yeah, well, after we won,” he said, “I figured I could.”\nThe Spartans beat the Wolverines, 27-23, last weekend.\ngregg.krupa@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/greggkrupa \n\nRed Wings at Oilers \nFaceoff: 9:30 Wednesday, Rexall Place, Edmonton, Alberta\nTV/radio: FSD/97.1\nOutlook: After consecutive losses, the Red Wings are confronting some bugaboos from last season — difficulty getting out of the zone, turnovers, faceoffs lost and too much time in the penalty box. ... The Oilers are coached by former Red Wings assistant Todd McLellan and feature Connor McDavid , 18, who had two goals and two assists in two games last weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:20:06.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
