The Lehigh defense was burned for a Patriot League record 304 yards rushing to Lafayette's Ross Scheuerman last year at Yankee Stadium where the Leopards rolled to a 27-7 win. The Lehigh defense is improved after a disappointing 2014 season. (CHRIS KNIGHT / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) Keith Groller Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Lehigh defense will need to be better against Yale \nThe Lehigh defense is better. \nThat's what everybody has been saying. \nAnd in the Mountain Hawks' victories over Central Connecticut State and Penn, there were distinctive signs of improvement from 2014 when Lehigh allowed 33.2 points and 475.6 yards per game. \nHowever, there is still a long way to go before the defense approaches the championship level of the 2010 and 2011 seasons. \nThat was made clear on Saturday night at Princeton when the Tigers erased a 13-10 deficit with two touchdowns in the final three minutes of the first half en route to a 52-36 victory that wasted a 561-yard offensive performance. \nA great test for the defense will come at 12:30 p.m. Saturday at Goodman Stadium against a Yale team that is 2-0 and averaging 31 points and 422 yards per game. \nIt's the final nonleague game of the season for the Mountain Hawks and one last gauge before league play begins at Bucknell on Oct. 10. \nColton Caslow has done his part to make the defense better. The junior linebacker leads the team with 51 tackles (Pierce Ripanti is second with 28) and said Lehigh will bring an attitude into this game. \n\"We're coming into this one confident and in high spirits,\" Caslow said. \"We're ready to play a great game and get ourselves straightened out for league play.\" \nYale was one of four teams to score 45 points or more against the Mountain Hawks in last year's dismal 3-8 season. The Bulldogs trailed 21-0 early, but roared back for a 54-43 win that included a 600-yard offensive performance by the home team at the Yale Bowl. \nTyler Varga, who is now with the Indianapolis Colts, ran for 152 yards and a touchdown in that game. \nHe's gone, but quarterback Morgan Roberts, a transfer from Clemson who threw for 356 yards and three touchdowns in New Haven, returns. \n\"That was definitely a tough one and that game reminded me of this last one against Princeton where we were fighting with them and then just kind of lost it,\" Caslow said. \"I don't like to think about last year because this is a whole new team. We're very confident in what we're capable of doing. I'm excited to see how good we can be.\" \nCaslow said that one area that still needs to get much better is takeaways. In four games, Lehigh has just two interceptions and two fumble recoveries, one of which went 72 yards for a touchdown against Princeton. Olivier Rigaud's fumble return cut Princeton's lead to 31-19 with 14:22 left, but the Tigers still scored three more touchdowns before the game ended. \nEven though Lehigh's defense has been hit hard by injuries, Caslow believes the team has enough quality athletes to fill the holes. \nLehigh coach Andy Coen said that tackle D.J. Bourgeois is the latest to be sidelined for the season, joining others such as rovers LaQuan Lambert and Joe Barrett. \nThe Mountain Hawks have had to go with many young players. On the two-deep chart, nine of the 22 defensive players are freshmen or sophomores. \n\"We've got young kids who we think are going to go be good players, and they will be,\" Coen said. \"Youth not only breeds inexperience, but it also means lack of physical development. We've got some guys playing now who will weigh 15 pounds more next year and they'll be running a little faster. All you can do is put your guys in the right position to make plays and hopefully they'll make those plays.\" \nEveryone will be tested by a Yale team that stormed back from a 19-point deficit to beat Cornell 33-26, outscoring the Big Red 20-0 in the second half. \n\"The biggest threat is their passing game,\" Caslow said. \"They have a strong quarterback and a great receiving corps. We're going to have to try to shut down their deep threats with our secondary and be great up front.\" \nCoen said it's important for his team to win at home, especially considering it's homecoming, and also the start of the school's 150 t h anniversary campaign. \nIt's also important to generate momentum for the league schedule, especially since Patriot League play starts at Bucknell, considered one of the top contenders. \nCoen talked to his team about how the season is going by quickly and it's time to seize the moment. \n\"This is already our fifth game â€¦ it's unbelievable how fast it's going, and for the seniors, I can't imagine how quick it seems,\" Coen said. \"We really want to get this one and set ourselves up for the start of the league which is really what it comes down to. Those are the most important five, six weeks of the season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:43:59.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
