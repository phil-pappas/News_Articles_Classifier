This was my main goal to actually get this down and achieve it,\" said Tyler Pynnonen. \nAfter five years of practicing in between military training, Pynnonen landed a front flip on his snow mobile 30–feet above the dirt last October. \nHe has been able to repeat the trick about six times since last year. \n\"I originally started doing this on a pedal bike into a lake and that's what led to the whole idea and then I used all the money I saved up in high school and working throughout college and built my own foam pit and started practicing into there,\" said Pynnonen. \nHe says adrenalin was pumping through his body as he drove his snowmobile down a ramp that looks like a wall. \n\"I didn't really have any fears I was just mostly hoping that I didn't disappoint everybody that was there watching it,\" said Pynnonen. \nFor those who aspire to compete in extreme freestyle sports, Pynnonen has one piece of advice. \n\"Just make sure to follow your dreams and to build your dream because otherwise someone's probably going to hire you to help build theirs.\" \nTyler Pynnonen hopes to one day be on ESPN as a top athlete and wants to break the distance jump record and achieve new freestyle tricks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:22:54.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
