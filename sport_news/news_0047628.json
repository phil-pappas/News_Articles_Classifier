(Photo: Dale G. Young/Detroit News) \nEast Lansing — To say this week is like any other would be foolish — especially in this state.\nOn Tuesday, it was Michigan State's turn to try to not create any bulletin board material for the opponent. Michigan succeeded Monday, and Michigan State was just as measured in its comments as the teams prepare for the most-anticipated installment of the rivalry in recent memory.\nAt Michigan Stadium on Saturday, No. 7 Michigan State takes on No. 12 Michigan, the first time the teams have faced each other while ranked in the top 15 since 2003, when No. 11 Michigan beat No. 9 Michigan State, 27-20.\nBoth teams had their eyes on a Big Ten championship that season — Michigan earned that title while Michigan State lost three of its last four — and the stakes are higher this time.\nEach team believes it's in position to play for a spot in the College Football Playoff. Michigan State (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) expected to all along but has battled injuries and perception while remaining unbeaten through six games, while Michigan (5-1, 2-0) has surprised many, shooting up the polls after three straight shutouts, its only loss coming at now-No. 4 Utah.\nTo reach the playoff, however, winning a conference title is a must.\nBut, as Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said Tuesday, even with as much emotion that goes into this game, it's still just one on the path to the ultimate goal.\nDETROIT NEWS\nDantonio: No reason MSU, UM can't both be great\n\"All I can tell you is this is one game of the year,\" he said. \"It's a very meaningful game, but you still have to win your other games to be successful.\n\"I think both teams can have good football teams. It's been done before, and both teams have gone to big bowls in the past, at the same time. We can co-exist.\"\nCo-existing as two powerful programs hasn't been the norm in this series. Michigan struggled for the bulk of the previous seven seasons, posting three losing records, while Michigan State has turned into a national power, winning 11 or more four of the last five seasons.\nBefore that, Michigan dominated for stretches while Michigan State struggled.\nHaving both teams fighting near the top of the national rankings heightens the rivalry.\n\"We're undefeated, they have one loss, 'GameDay' is there,\" Spartans quarterback Connor Cook said. \"There are just things that happen in a game like that where it wouldn't usually happen in a regular game. ... Certain guys rise to the occasion and more guys can emerge and stuff like that in situations like this.\"\nRanked or not, this game always has had a different feel.\nAfter defeating Rutgers last weekend, Michigan State freshman running back LJ Scott talked about the \"hate\" he was sure to experience this week as the Ohio native is indoctrinated into the series.\nFifth-year senior tackle Donavon Clark got his first career start at Michigan in 2012 — Michigan State's only loss in the series in the last seven years — and he said it's \"a different atmosphere that you feel.\"\nFor Cook, who hasn't played at Michigan Stadium, the atmosphere is something you can feel.\n\"It kinda runs through your body, runs through your veins and you kinda just get — get more pumped up than you would for any other opponent,\" he said.\nDETROIT NEWS\nGibson: With MSU on probation in '70s, UM game was everything\nAnd he can't wait to get on the field.\n\"You are going up against one of your rival teams, playing in their stadium, it's going to be a hostile environment, for how well they've played so far this season, you want to be in a situation like that,\" he said. \"You want to embrace it, and it's things you look forward to. I'm looking forward to it. I can't wait to go out there and play against them.\"\nDantonio never has shied from the intensity of the rivalry since he arrived in East Lansing. But it's also something he has relished no matter where he has coached.\nBut he did admit this week isn't quite the same as the rest. The outcome is still important in the Big Ten race, but there's a little more to it than a win over any other Big Ten team.\n\"There are certain games that you measure yourself against because you measure yourself against the past,\" Dantonio said. \"You sorta keep track of what's your record against these particular teams … and it doesn't have to be the Michigan-Michigan State game. It could be a different game at a different university, you tend to keep track of them.\n\"Not to say that the other games aren't important, but you just sort of put a little bit more emphasis on this.\"\nmcharboneau@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/mattcharboneau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:21:15.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
