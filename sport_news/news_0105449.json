Should the Royals win, they will be spraying each other with a sparkling wine called Ten Bucks from Mount Pleasant Winery in Augusta, MO.\n“We had the opportunity for the Royals to use it, so we got it over there immediately,” Mount Pleasant president Chuck Dressel said.\nDressel says the Cardinals have been using their sweet sparkler for a long time, all the way back to 1985.\nLet’s hope Ten Bucks is luckier for the Royals this year than it was for the Cardinals in ’85.\n“The Royals are our American League team. We’re so excited to be a part of this. We’re just huge baseball fans,” Dressel said.\nWith the Cardinals now out of the playoffs thanks for their rivals the Chicago Cubs, Mount Pleasant is hoping the Royals will be popping the corks on their Ten Bucks sparkler Wednesday night.\nBeyond that, Dressel said the Royals are likely in for an upgrade.\n“If they go to the American League Championship, and definitely if they get in the World Series, we’ll get them our dry sparkling wine, Brut Imperial,” Dressel shared.\nDressel said they do this because they’re huge baseballs fans, but he admits if a label or two of Ten Bucks sparkling wine happens to get on the air during the post-game celebration, well, “that doesn’t hurt either.”\nAs a bit of a sidebar, the Royals are not paying for the bubbly. It’s supplied by Mount Pleasant for free.\nAnd, Dressel said they’re happy to keep the free bubbles flowing all the way through the World Series.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
