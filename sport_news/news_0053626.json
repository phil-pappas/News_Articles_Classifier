Image 14 of 14 Mohawk Hudson event Morseman's third victory in three weeks 1  /  14 Back to Gallery Albany \nIn recent weeks, the weekend alarm clock goes off for Bryan Morseman and the 30-year-old knows what time it is. \nTime to run a marathon, another marathon. \nRunning in the Mohawk Hudson River Marathon for the second time, Morseman, the 2013 winner, successfully navigated the 26.2-mile course that started in Schenectady's Central Park and finished at the Corning Preserve, finishing in 2:24:01, the fifth-fastest time since the race's inception in 1983. \nMorseman was running his third marathon in three weeks and has added the Mohawk Hudson River title to go with his win in the Mill Race Marathon in Columbus, Ind., and last week's victory in the Wineglass Marathon in his home area of Corning. \nMore Information \nMohawk-Hudson River Marathon results \nMale overall results \n1.

It hurts, doing three in a row is tough.\"\nMorseman was on pace to eclipse Dale Keenan 's record (2:20:59 in 1984) at the halfway mark but could not continue on the record pace. \n\"I could feel the last 10 miles. Every mile it felt like there were five miles being added to my back,\" Morseman said. \"The legs started to really feel it.\"\nMorseman, who won three marathons in eight days earlier this year to help cover medical expenses for his infant son, Leeim, who was born with spina bifida, is unsure of his race schedule the rest of the year. \n\"I planned on doing another one in a couple of weeks in Cape Cod, but who knows,\" Morseman said. \"I'll plan and base that decision on how I recover.\"\nMegan Skeels of Fort Worth, Texas, made her Mohawk Hudson River Marathon debut a winning one, finishing in 2:46:40, a near-15-minute cushion over runner-up Dara Dalmata of Hopkinton, Mass. \nA chest cold forced Skeels to pull out of a marathon in Minneapolis last week, but a phone call to Elite Athlete coordinator Ed Neiles helped Skeels get into the race. \n\"The director, Ed, was so kind. He said to come and run this race,\" Skeels said. \"I don't think I was totally healthy today, but I am so grateful.\"\nSkeels, in her sixth marathon, enjoyed the scenery along her trek despite dealing with a tough wind while running through the downtown Albany portion of the race. \n\"It is probably the prettiest course, I don't think you can top this for beauty. I felt really great until we had to go downtown and handle the wind,\" Skeels said. \"Getting to break that tape was one of the most fun things I've had in years.\"\nSkeels was spurred on by the support of race spectators on hand throughout the course. \n\"The people on the course were delightful,\" Skeels said. \"For a Texas girl coming back east and having women and men yell for me like I was their own, complete strangers telling me I could make it was great because there were times I wasn't sure I could finish the race.\"\nFormer Niskayuna high standout Louis Serafini won the men's half-marathon and Grace Kahura of Katonah (Westchester County) took top honors in the female division. \nSean Martin , a local freelance writer, is a frequent contributor to the Times Union .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:58:30.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
