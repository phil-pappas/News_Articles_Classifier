Maertens finished 24 of 29, while Drew Dyer led Benton's receivers with 10 catches for 112 yards. \n\" I thought we executed well,\" Benton Coach Scott Neathery said. \"Our quarterback's percentage was good. Twenty-four for twenty-nine, I'll take that.\" \nHunter led the Panthers with 124 yards on 16 carries and had 99 yards on 4 catches. Colton Nix had 76 yards and 1 touchdown on 7 catches. \nJohnathan Buss led Lake Hamilton with 121 yards on 27 carries. \nThe Wolves managed a 44-yard filed goal by Ethan Johnson on their first possession but didn't score again until fullback Eli Jackson scored from the 4 with 4:37 to play. \nMaertens came out hot, completing 7 of 9 passes while guiding Benton to touchdowns on its first two possessions. He hit Nix with perfectly thrown 21-yard touchdown pass 1:27 seconds into the game, and his second TD toss covered 29 yards to Dyer on a skinny post route with 4:25 left in the quarter. \nLake Hamilton's offense limited the Panthers' chances by driving 30 yards after Ramar Easter's 25-yard kickoff return before settling for Johnson's field goal between Benton's touchdowns. Jackson ran 11 yards for a first down and quarterback Bryce Briggs raced for 14 yards on the next play before the drive stalled. \nSports on 10/24/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:19:02.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
