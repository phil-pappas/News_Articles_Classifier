The state-ranked Cavaliers won 70-0, setting up a District 14-6A showdown next week against Westlake, their fellow unbeaten. CREDIT: Jay Plotkin/For American-Statesman Snow had a big night for the Rangers, gaining 142 yards on the ground and throwing for 206 more as the Rangers improved to 6-1 and 3-1 in district play. Dripping Springs fell to 4-3 and 2-2.\nTyler Harris caught five passes for 121 yards and a touchdown for Vista Ridge. Running back Isaiah Vilaire had 87 all-purpose yards and a touchdown. Quarterback Collin Berzsenyi led the Tigers with 215 passing yards. Tight end Nick Bever had four catches for 99 yards.\nVista Ridge started strong, scoring on a 35-yard pass from Snow to Tyler Harris on the first series of the game. Ridge went for it on fourth down and cashed in on Snow’s strike to Harris.\nThe Rangers scored a second first-quarter touchdown on a fumble recovery in the end zone by Jamil Pittman. The Tigers answered with two touchdowns of their own as the teams went into halftime tied 14-14. Dripping Springs got on the board with a 2-yard run by Bobby Credeur and then a 10-yard pass from Berzsenyi to Keith Mitchhart.\nLake Travis 70, Austin High 0: Maleek Barkley returned the opening kickoff for a 97-yard touchdown, and the host Cavaliers (7-0, 5-0) cruised past the Maroons (4-3, 2-3) in their final game before next Friday’s District 14-6A mega-showdown at Westlake.\nBarkley fielded the kick, made a cut up the middle and ran untouched into the end zone.\n“I saw daylight and hit it,” Barkley said. “We wanted to set the tempo right from the start.”\nCharlie Brewer and Abe Willows each ran for two scores as Lake Travis used its ground attack to dominate. The Cavaliers rumbled for 400 yards rushing on 32 carries.\nWillows led the way with 92 yards on just four carries. Backup quarterback Josiah Snowden gained 84 on four carries, including a 62-yard score. Brewer gained 77 yards on four carries while completing 8 of 12 passes for 114 yards.\nLake Travis outgained Austin High 546-135.\nThe Cavaliers also got touchdown runs from Cade Green and Santiago Villegas. Michael Mast added a special-teams touchdown, returning a fumble for a score when the Maroons mishandled a kickoff.\n“We were a little out of sync with our passing game early,” Cavaliers coach Hank Carter said, “and Charlie got knocked around a little bit. We’ve got some things to fix, but I can’t complain about the performance.”\nLake Travis’ defense registered its third shutout in four games. Since Hays scored 13 points on Sept. 12, the Cavaliers have allowed just a fourth-quarter field goal to Anderson last week. Lake Travis limited Austin High to just 135 yards offense on the night.\n“We wanted to get ourselves set up for next week,” Barkley said, referring to the showdown with the Chaps. “We’re going into that game full speed.”\nBoth Lake Travis (sixth) and Westlake (eighth) are ranked in the state polls and will enter the game undefeated.\n— Jay Plotkin, AA-S correspondent\nWestlake 55, Hays 3: Sam Ehlinger connected with Chase Cokley for three of his six touchdown passes to lift the state’s eighth-ranked Chaps (7-0, 5-0 District 14-6A) over the Rebels (4-4, 3-3) in Buda. That sets up the huge showdown next Friday for the district championship.\nThe University of Texas pledge matched his career-high for TD passes while completing 21 of 25 attempts for 369 yards. He also had 55 yards on 10 carries while accounting for seven total touchdowns.\nThe Chaparrals have struggled getting started in the first quarter most of the season, but there were no signs of a sluggish start at Bob Shelton Stadium.\nEhlinger found Cokley for a 26-yard score on the Chaps’ first possession. He then had a 33-yard touchdown pass to Kylen Granson and a 14-yard toss to Reed Klubnick as the Chaps built a 20-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.\nHays punter Travis Selby converted his first of two fake punts late in the first quarter as part of a long drive that carried over into the second quarter. The Rebels capitalized and got the ball down to the Westlake 14-yard-line. Facing fourth and 1, a false start penalty on the Rebels forced Hays to settle for a 36-yard field goal by Jax Kell.\nThat would be the only points the Rebels would get as the Chaps built a 34-3 lead at halftime.\nWestlake opened the second half with pretty much the same momentum, but the Chaps had a 59-yard touchdown reception by Cokley called back due to a holding penalty. Eight plays later, however, Ehlinger found Andrew Boykin for one of two touchdown tosses to the junior.\nWestlake had two penalties negate touchdowns. In the first quarter, Elias Garcia had a pick-six called back for roughing the passer.\nAfter a 68-yard score by Boykin from Ehlinger on Westlake’s next drive, Mack Kelley returned an interception 30 yards for a touchdown three plays later, with 1:51 left in the third quarter.\n— Michael Adams, ACN\nHendrickson 22, Pflugerville 6: DJ Johnson scored three touchdowns as the host Hawks (6-1, 4-0 District 13-6A) edged the Panthers (1-6, 1-3) to capture “The Battle of the Ville” for the fourth straight season.\nJohnson capped a three-play drive with a 30-yard scoring run on the first Hendrickson possession. Then the teams settled into a fierce defensive contest that the Hawks led 7-0 after a quarter.\nPflugerville closed the margin in the start of the second quarter when Alex Shillow fielded a Hendrickson punt at the Panthers 35-yard line, cut right, ducked inside the coverage then raced 65 yards for the touchdown. The extra-point attempt failed, leaving the Panthers down 7-6.\nHendrickson’s Johnson added his second score of the night on a 12-yard run to close the second-quarter scoring, sending the Hawks into halftime with a 14-6 lead.\nJohnson’s 5-yard fourth-quarter jaunt capped the Hawks scoring in a game that saw the high-powered Hendrickson offense limited to 261 total yards while the Panthers were thwarted with 150 yards total offense.\nThe victory was a Hawk tuneup for next Friday’s showdown against Round Rock, which improved to 6-1 overall and 5-0 in district after beating Cedar Ridge (6-1, 3-1). The Hawks play host to the Raiders the following week as the titans of 13-6A square off for playoff positioning.\nPflugerville remains alive in pursuit of the fourth and final district playoff spot and is home to Westwood next Friday\n— Butch Hart, AA-S correspondent\nLBJ 41, Cedar Creek 10: The first winning streak in Cedar Creek football history ended at three games as the Jaguars (5-2, 4-0) utilized a strong rushing attack to smother the Eagles (3-4, 3-1) in a battle of District 26-5A unbeatens at Nelson Field.\nLBJ quarterback De’Andre Wytaske was the star of the evening, scoring four touchdowns – three on offense, one on special teams – and racking up 241 yards total offense. Wytaske helped the Jaguars accrue 403 yards, while the LBJ defense held Cedar Creek to 178.\n“We were both 3-0 in the district, so I knew I had to come out here and make big plays,” said Wytaske. “We want to be back where we were last year. We want to be district champions again.”\nLBJ scored on its third play from scrimmage. With the Jaguars deep in their own territory, Wytaske picked up a fumble near the goal line and sprinted 98 yards for a touchdown. Two Cedar Creek defenders had good angles on Wytaske, but neither could run him down.\nWytaske added another clip to his highlight reel at the end of the first half. The 5-foot-6-inch, 155-pound speedster fielded a punt at the LBJ 45 and dashed up the home sideline, crossing the goal line with no time left on the clock. The score extended the LBJ lead to 21-3 heading into the break.\nThe Jaguars scored three more rushing touchdowns in the third quarter to take a commanding 41-3 lead. The Cedar Creek offense scored its only touchdown of the game in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter. LBJ’s defense was stout from the onset, holding the Eagles to 3.3 yards per carry.\nStill, it was Wytaske who stole the show.\n“We’re moving closer to where we want to be,” he said. “Tonight was another step in the right direction.”\n— Mike Schoeffel, AA-S correspondent\nReagan 64, Travis 0: Mulbah Car rushed for 173 yards on 17 carries, scoring four touchdowns, as Reagan moved into a second-place tie in District 26-5A.\nA University of Houston recruit, Car unofficially needs 43 more yards to break the career rushing record by an Austin school district running back. Former Crockett standout Justin Miller set the mark of 4,256 yards last season. Reagan (4-3, 3-1) will face McCallum (3-4, 2-2) next week.\nThe Raiders led Travis 57-0 at halftime as Car scored on carries of 2, 8, 73 and 32 yards. Reagan quarterback Amado Aguilera completed 11 of 15 passes overall for 222 yards and three touchdowns while Jeremy Bell recorded all three TD receptions, finishing with four catches for 76 yards.\nReagan also scored a pair of defensive touchdowns, one on a fumble return by Jose Jaimes and the other on an interception return by defensive end Lamonte Simms.\nTravis slipped to 0-7.\nBowie 48, Akins 7: Two weeks after suffering its first loss of the season, Bowie (6-1, 4-1 in 14-6A) rebounded to defeat Akins in a dominant fashion.\nThanks to a bye week, the Bulldogs had to endure the bad taste of a 24-9 loss to Westlake on Oct. 2 longer than usual, but they jumped ahead quickly against Akins (4-4, 2-4). Brandon Ramos connected with Josh Wainwright for a 62 yard touchdown just 92 seconds into the game to open the scoring, and the Bulldogs led 34-0 by halftime.\nMatthew Wheeler hit Reagan Shaw for a 14-yard touchdown pass before Ramos found Wainwright again for a 7-yard TD. After Dalynn Threadgill scored on a 1-yard run, Ramos found Shaw for a 7-yard TD pass to close the first-half scoring.\nRamos threw for 224 yards and three touchdowns while platooning with Wheeler, who rushed for 74 yards.\nWainwright finished with 113 yards receiving, as Bowie rolled up more than 500 yards of offense.\nThe Eagles (4-4, 2-4), also coming off a loss to Westlake, scored late in the fourth quarter, when quarterback Mike Gonzales raced 58 yards to the end zone.\n— Chris Allman, AA-S correspondent\nStony Point 10, Westwood 0: Stony Point picked up its first District 13-6A victory of the season, blanking Westwood at Dragon Stadium.\nStony Point (4-3, 1-3) limited Westwood to 137 yards, forced seven punts and recovered a fumble in the fourth quarter as Westwood was driving into Stony Point territory. The Tigers recorded their second shutout of the season while snapping a three-game losing streak.\nWestwood’s defense allowed 352 total yards, but the Warriors also forced two turnovers and blocked a field-goal attempt in the fourth quarter.\nDom Williams scored Stony Point’s only touchdown on his first carry of the game, a 25-yard scamper down the left sideline that came late in the second quarter. Santiago Maya added a 28-yard field goal in the third quarter.\nMichael Scroggins finished with 71 yards on 10 carries for the Tigers while Tanner Aenchbacher completed 10 of 13 passes for 155 yards.\nJack Swensen completed 13 of 23 passes for 91 yards for Westwood (0-7, 0-4).\n— Sean Shapiro, AA-S correspondent\nGeorgetown 59, East View 27: After missing last week’s win over Marble Falls, Dakota Cahill rolled up five touchdowns as the Eagles (5-2, 2-2 District 25-5A) flew past the Patriots (3-4, 0-4) in Georgetown.\nCahill scored on runs of 1, 3, 10 and 51 yards, as well as hauling in a 7-yard TD pass from Chandler Herman. The senior finished with a game-high 117 yards on 14 carries.\nGeorgetown lost four fumbles, but the Eagles amassed 593 yards offense and kept their playoff hopes alive. Herman accounted for 302 total yards as he finished 17 of 25 passing for 209 yards and two touchdowns while tacking on 93 yards on the ground.\nJo’Vonta Grimble paced the Eagles receivers with six grabs for a team-high 103 yards and a score.\nThe Patriots’ Torrie Davis rumbled for 116 hard-earned yards on 18 carries. He scored on a 42-yard carry in the second quarter. East View’s Michael Distad led all receivers with 10 catches for 109 yards, including a 28-yard score from Austin Moreno.\nThe Eagles visit Vista Ridge next Friday in an important game for each team’s postseason chances.\n—Mark Champ, AA-S correspondent\nLeander 42, Marble Falls 28: To have any shot at the playoffs, the host Lions faced basically a must-win situation against the Mustangs. It didn’t come easily, but eventually they picked up a victory.\nBehind a big-play passing game, Leander steadily pulled away for a victory that squares the 3-4 Lions at 2-2 in District 25-5A. Though games against East View, Vista Ridge and Dripping Springs are still to come, Leander at least kept itself in the postseason conversation.\nThe first half was filled with big plays by both teams on both sides of the ball.\nLeander’s Matthew Long opened the scoring with a 67-yard fumble return. Marble Falls (2-5, 0-4) answered with a 40-yard touchdown pass from Robert Atkinson to Eric Cauble, which was then answered with a Leander score on a 65-yard pass from Parker McNeil to Dalton Flowers. The Lions started to take control of the game late in the second half when Ty Worthy scored on a tipped pass from 8 yards out with only 15 seconds remaining in the half to push the lead to 28-14.\nMarble Falls fought hard throughout the game but was unable to overcome five turnovers. The last one, an interception returned 24 yards for a touchdown by Alex Williams, put the game away for Leander.\n— Mark Swanson, AA-S correspondent\nBastrop 40, McCallum 16: Jovahn Jones rushed for 112 yards and two touchdowns as Bastrop rallied for a victory in a District 26-5A matchup.\nThe Bears (4-3, 2-2) fell behind 6-0 when McCallum’s Andre Blakemore caught a 9-yard touchdown pass from TylerPage in the first quarter. Bastrop pulled ahead on Adonis Davis’ 9-yard touchdown run, but McCallum’s Jonah Smith added a 28-yard field goal for the Knights (3-4, 2-2) early in the second quarter.\nTrailing 9-7, Bastrop closed the first half with 21 unanswered points, as Jones scored on runs of 4 and 16 yards before Ben Flores tossed a 36-yard touchdown pass to Noe Salazar.\nAnderson 17, Del Valle 13: Running back Kenneth Robertson accounted for 121 total yards and two touchdowns as Anderson claimed its first District 14-6A victory.\nThe Trojans’ win snapped a five-game losing streak in which they were outscored by an average of 35.3 points per game. Del Valle (2-5, 2-3) committed four turnovers while Anderson (3-5, 1-5) lost the football twice.\nAnderson opened the game with 10 unanswered points before Del Valle’s Luis Escalante kicked a 28-yard field goal.\nOn his first pass of the game, Elijah Duran found La’Thaniel Washington in the back of the end zone for a 26-yard touchdown in the third quarter, trimming the Cardinals’ deficit to three points. Washington recorded a game-high 118 yards receiving on six catches, but his scoring catch was Del Valle’s only touchdown of the game.\nWith Del Valle driving late in the third quarter, Duran threw an interception that was returned 51 yards by Eric Slatter. Robertson tacked on his second touchdown of the game — a 25-yard run — on Anderson’s first play of the ensuing drive.\n— Quixem Ramirez, AA-S\nTemple 54, Hutto 7: The powerful Wildcats (7-1, 4-0) rushed for 407 yards and their defense stifled the high-octane attack of the host Hippos (4-3, 1-2) for all but one play in this District 17-5A mismatch.\nTemple was up just 6-0 after one quarter but outscored Hutto 28-7 in the second period to take command.\nDe’Vonte Nealy scored on runs of 55 and 9 yards in that outburst, and Nealy finished with 218 yards on 18 carries.\nTrailing 27-0, quarterback Tyler Herrick provided the Hippos’ one moment with a 90-yard touchdown run with 3:45 to play in the half. But Herrick, normally a prodigious passer, was held to 11 of 19 for 102 yards. He ran 12 times for 95 yards, gaining just five yards in his other 11 carries beyond the long-distance TD. Tristen Bayless had four catches for 72 yards for Hutto.\nThe Wildcats’ Jemiyah Franklin closed the first-half scoring with a 43-yard touchdown run, and quarterback Reid Hesse opened the third quarter with his second and third TD tosses. Hesse finished 13 of 16 for 207 yards.\nTemple gained 641 yards to Hutto’s 227.\nLockhart 42, S.A. Kennedy 7: The Lions (7-1, 5-1 District 27-5A) turned loose a crunching ground game on the Rockets (1-6, 0-5), rushing for 432 yards in an easy win in San Antonio.\nStephon Houston ran for touchdowns of 42 and 10 yards to get Lockhart rolling, and D.J. Ellison added a pair of scores on short runs. They each went over 100 yards. Ellison piled up 183 on 20 carries, and Houston produced 124 yards on 12 trips.\nQuarterback Nick Sanchez only had to throw one pass, completing it, in a game the Lions led 21-7 at the break.\nLiberty Hill 51, Taylor 21: The host Panthers (5-2, 2-0 District 14-4A, Division I) unleashed three 100-yard rushers and amassed 575 yards total offense — every one of them on the ground — in taking down the Ducks (2-5, 1-1).\nJon Shannon opened the scoring with a 72-yard run early in the first quarter for Liberty Hill and was the game’s leading rusher with 171 yards on 16 carries. Caleb Guerin tacked on 155 yards on 13 trips and Justin Burkett, who nailed down the Panthers’ last three touchdowns, had 108 yards on 15 hauls. QB Garrett Wright only threw one pass.\nTaylor, which trailed 27-7 at the half, had an explosive scoring play in the third period when Malik Jackson nabbed a 43-yard pass from Terrell Reynolds to cut the Ducks’ deficit to 30-14. The Panthers put up the next 21 points.\nGatesville 23, Lampasas 21: The host Badgers (2-5, 0-2 District 13-4A, Division I) had a fourth-quarter burst to get close and missed a two-point conversion for a tie against the Hornets (2-5, 1-1).\nDown 23-7, Lampasas QB Cohen Cockburn ran 8 yards for a TD and passed to Jason Murphy for the conversion to make it 23-15. With time running out, Cockburn hit Harrison Gillespie with a 79-yard scoring strike, but a two-point conversion run failed.\nLampasas outgained Gatesville 408-271 as Cockburn passed for 151 yards and ran for 110.\nConnally 21, Elgin 8: The Cougars defense ruled the night as Connally (3-5, 1-3) stonewalled the visiting Wildcats (1-6, 1-2), and dual-threat QB Robert Patterson provided enough offense to secure the District 17-5A win.\nConnally held Elgin to 29 yards rushing, 154 yards total and seven first downs.\nPatterson ran for 101 yards on 10 carries with a touchdown and threw for a second score, completing 12 of 20 for 110 yards.\nBurnet 40, Waco Robinson 35: Joel Johnson caught a 95-yard touchdown pass from Austin Moore with 6:42 remaining in the game, and that proved to be the winner as the host Bulldogs (5-2, 1-1 District 13-4A, Division I) outlasted the Rockets (1-6, 1-1).\nIt was Johnson’s third scoring reception of the night and gave Burnet a 40-28 lead, shielding his team from a last-minute score by Robinson. Johnson also had TD grabs of 19 and 23 yards and finished with one of the area’s best totals for a receiver all season: 180 yards on seven catches.\nMoore, who’s been putting up huge numbers on a weekly basis, completed 25 of 36 passes for 392 yards with five touchdowns and one interception.\nSteven Gallardo helped give Burnet a 20-14 halftime edge with TD hauls of 18 and 46 yards from Moore. Gallardo finished with nine receptions for 136 yards.\nRockdale 34, Lago Vista 21: Jaquayln Crawford caught two touchdown passes and returned an interception for a third score as the Tigers (5-2, 1-1 District 10-3A, Division I) handled the visiting Vikings (2-5, 1-1).\nDavid Franklin hit Crawford for 19- and 30-yard TD tosses to give Rockdale a 13-0 lead after one quarter. Crawford had eight catches for 99 yards. His pick-six closed the Tigers’ scoring in the fourth quarter.\nLago Vista came to life in the second period. Jacob Carpeno raced 67 yards to get the Vikings on the board at 20-7. Bryce Hardway hauled in a 23-yard pass from Austin Polk to cut the deficit to 20-14 at halftime. That was as close as Lago Vista came.\nThe Vikings hung around much of the night because of four fumble recoveries.\nHyde Park 35, S.A. Cornerstone 0: Running back Seth DeVries had another huge night, and the visiting Panthers (7-0, 3-0) picked off five passes to remain unbeaten by shutting out the Warriors (4-3, 2-1) in San Antonio.\nDeVries rushed for 236 yards on 25 carries and scored touchdowns from 59 and 30 yards out.\nHyde Park jumped to a 14-0 first-quarter lead on Bo Stewart’s 10-yard TD pass to Charles Larkam and DeVries’ 59-yard jaunt.\nThat was more than enough for a defense that held Cornerstone to 179 yards. Brooks Benkendorfer had seven unassisted tackles and an interception. Taylor Faber added two sacks for the Panthers.\nSt. Michael’s 49, S.A. Christian 0: Gabriel Vondrak hit on three scoring passes, and seven different St. Michael’s players found the end zone as the host Crusaders (4-3, 2-0) crushed the Lions (1-7, 0-2).\nVondrak threw for 240 yards, and Connor Gjerset was his favorite target, catching six for 125 yards and a TD.
