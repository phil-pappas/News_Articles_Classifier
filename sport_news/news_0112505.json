The fourth-seeded Sounders will host the fifth-seeded and defending champion Los Angeles Galaxy on Wednesday at CenturyLink Field, but that matchup didn’t become clear until the dying minutes of Sunday’s match or guaranteed until the final whistle blew in Kansas City.\nFor the first time in MLS history, each of the regular-season finales in each conference kicked off simultaneously – with the exception of Red Bulls-Fire, which was pushed back with the Western Conference kickoffs to keep the Supporters’ Shield drama between New York and Dallas alive.\nFor their part, the Sounders players say they were focused on taking care of their own business on Sunday. They needed a win to ensure qualification – otherwise, results elsewhere could conspire to knock them into seventh place and out of the postseason.\n“It’s best to focus on what you can control,” Sounders substitute Chad Barrett said, though he did cop to sneaking occasional glances up at the boards flashing out-of-town scores. “You can’t control what those other teams are doing. They’re fighting for their lives and we’re doing the same thing.”\nSeattle (15-13-6) certainly didn’t play like a team caught in two minds. \nThe opening goal was simple, Dempsey tapping in Obafemi Martins’ pinpoint cross. No. 2 was impressive both for the effort and the skill involved – and underlined how much more potent the Sounders attack is when everybody is at full strength. Dempsey says he feels as healthy as he’s been since injuring his hamstring in early August. He looked like it as he hustled onto the rebound of Martins’ initial shot, using a ninja kick to keep on top of the ball and the shot under the crossbar.\n“I felt sharp and in the game felt good,” Dempsey said. “It took me a while coming back from that hamstring injury I was dealing with. … Now, I feel like I’m getting my legs back and able to make those runs behind the back line.”\nWhen Dempsey’s shot splashed into the back of the net, the Sounders had already climbed to third place in the up-to-the-second league standings with an outside shot at a first-round bye.\nBy the numbers 55,435 Attendance at CenturyLink for Sunday’s game.\n44,245 Average home attendance for the Sounders this season, an MLS record. Seattle held the previous record with an average of 44,038 in 2013.\nThe only post-match critique of MLS’ new final-day format is that the league so long to implement it.\nBranded “Decision Day,” Sunday’s slate of games was an emotional rollercoaster, results flooding in from elsewhere and changing the playoff picture by the minute. A few Sounders gave into the temptation to sneak a peek even if most of their teammates preferred blissful ignorance.\n“At halftime, I think I was pretty much the only one to ask what the other results were and how they landed,” Seattle captain Brad Evans said.\nAt one point in the first half, the Sounders rose within a Rapids goal against the Timbers of second place and a first-round bye, then quickly settled back into fourth with word of Robbie Keane’s tally for Los Angeles in Kansas City.\n“I’ve never seen it this close, in any year and in any kind of a race,” said Barrett, a 12-year MLS veteran. “Any team could have gotten second and any team could have gotten seventh. It was nuts.”\nDarlington Nagbe scored twice in Portland to calm Timbers nerves. Up Interstate 5 at BC Place, Vancouver struggled to find its rhythm against Houston until Kekuta Manneh struck in the second half to drop Seattle down another rung. Benny Feilhaber came off the bench and delivered in Kansas City, giving Sporting the lead on the Galaxy.\nAt CenturyLink, Luis Gil blew the Sounder shutout, but Salt Lake never really threatened any more damage than that. The whistle blew in Seattle just seconds before it did at Sporting Park to confirm Kansas City’s win and finalize the bracket.\n“We would have loved to have gotten in with a few more ties or wins, but this is how it happened,” Barrett said. “We have L.A. here. It’s what everybody wants to see.”\nMatt Pentz: 206-464-3184 or mpentz@seattletimes.com .
