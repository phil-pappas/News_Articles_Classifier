Okay, so Washington had a legitimate excuse with a rash of injuries, but the group that Jay Gruden had to work with on Sunday was highly suspect. The Jets sputtered out of the gate before pouring it in the second half. Bowles’ team scored 24 consecutive points after intermission to turn this one onto a laugher.\nRELATED: JETS BEAT UP ON WASHINGTON, IMPROVE TO 4-1\nGame ball: We might have to rename this category the Chris Ivory Trophy. The bruising running back topped 100 rushing yards in back-to-back games for the first time in his career. One game after Ivory ran for a career-high 166 yards, he set a new career mark for total yards, carving up Washington on the ground and through the air.\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News Chris Ivory tops the 100-yard rushing mark in back-to-back games to lead Jets to win.\nWhat this means: The Jets had no post bye-week hangover even though they practically sleepwalked through the first half. A 17-point third quarter eruption ensured that Bowles wouldn’t feel the same pain that Rex Ryan typically felt after byes. The Jets were 1-5 after the bye under Ryan.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nGood sign: Eric Decker and Brandon Marshall bounced back from a pair of first-half turnovers in style. Marshall’s shoe-string catch for a 35-yard score in the third quarter highlighted another 100-yard day. Decker has scored in each of the four games that he’s played with Ryan Fitzpatrick this season.\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News Jets wide receiver Eric Decker's fumble in the first half is recovered by Washington.\nBad Sign: The Jets might have had a season high in points, but three first-half turnovers will get them buried by a competent opponent. Marshall and Decker, two of Chan Gailey’s most reliable options, each fumbled to set up Washington scores. Fitzpatrick’s interception with 36 seconds left in the first half also led to Washington points. Washington scored all 13 first-half points off turnovers after having scored just three off of opponents’ miscues in the first five games.\nNext week: Bowles made it clear all week that he didn’t believe in “trap games” with the Patriots on the horizon. Apparently, that wasn’t just coach-speak. The Jets ultimately feasted on a poor team. What awaits is an entirely different beast. Bowles & Co. travel to Foxborough next week in easily their most difficult challenge so far.\nRelated Stories Jets Insider: Sheldon Richardson picks up half a sack Mehta: Jets' Geno may have better shot at comeback than RG3 Tags: chris ivory , eric decker , brandon marshall , washington nfl team", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js", "http://images.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:30:37.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
