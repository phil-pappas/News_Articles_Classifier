Powell converted a pass from Dylan Carthy to help Nantucket improve to 6-0, 5-0 in the Cape & Islands League. St. John Paul II (4-2-2, 2-1-1 C&I) took a 1-0 lead early on after a Oliver Dyche tally. The Whalers tied things up roughly three minutes later on goal by Luis Terragno, off an Oscar Guerra assist, with the sides going to the half knotted at 1-all. The Lions had their opportunities down the stretch but could not capitalize. Dyche’s goal was just the second allowed by Nantucket this season. Sawyer Horan was strong at central midfield for St. John Paul II while Brendan Smith was key on defense and Trevor Miliken played well in net. Sturgis West 1, Cape Cod Academy 0: The Navigators put together a strong team effort, backing Alex Grant’s early second half goal, en route to a Cape & Islands win at Old Townhouse Field in Yarmouth. Grant headed home a nifty pass from fellow co-captain Charlie Thomas 10:28 after the half for the game’s lone goal. John Ryan was little tested in net for Sturgis West (3-1-3 overall and C&I) but made plays when he had to. Ryan got strong support from his defense while Rohan Kansagara, Thomas McCormick, Vail Cote, John Avis and Andrew Barrera were all key for the Navigators. Cape Cod Academy is 3-5-1, 1-4-1 in the league. Sturgis East 3, Cape Tech 0: The Storm scored three goals in the second half en route to a Cape & Islands League win over the Crusaders in Harwich. Jake LaMotte broke the ice 1:04 after the half on an assist from Ahmad Akkawi, with Aiden Smith and Kelly Britton adding goals later in the half for the 3-0 final. Nick Pinard earned the shutout for Sturgis East (4-1-4, 3-1-1 C&I) while Julia Alvarez was also strong in goal for Cape Tech (1-5). The Storm also got strong play from freshman Will Furtado. Martha’s Vineyard 3, Bishop Feehan 2: Jason Lages scored twice, including the game winner, as the Vineyarders beat the Shamrocks in Eastern Athletic Conference action in Oak Bluffs. Miles Jordi also scored for Martha’s Vineyard (5-3, 2-1). Bishop Feehan is 5-2-1, 3-1 in the league.
