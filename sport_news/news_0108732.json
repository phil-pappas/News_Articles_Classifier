Alie has long had a strong sense of his place in the game of football, even when it seemed like he might not have a place in the game.\nOn Saturday at Autzen Stadium, less than five miles from the home where he was raised and where his parents still live, Alie might get his first start as a college quarterback. He's almost guaranteed to take snaps for the Ducks in the game against the Cougars (6 p.m. ET, Pac-12 Network), making it today's only FBS matchup pitting walk-on quarterbacks against each other.\nWashington State is led by sophomore Luke Falk, whose transfer during his junior year of high school led to him being lost in the recruiting shuffle before coach Mike Leach offered him a place on the Cougars' roster but not a scholarship (the Cougars were at their 85-grant limit at the time). \"I thought that Luke got overlooked,\" Leach said this week. \"I thought he was a Division I player from the beginning.\"\nUSA TODAY\nRoad Map to Week 6's most intriguing college football games\nWith that in mind, Leach fully intended to offer Falk a scholarship as soon as he could, and Falk had been on campus barely more than a year when he got one.\nWashington State also happened to be Alie's other walk-on offer, and he remains without a scholarship in his third year on Oregon's campus. But that doesn't trouble him in the least.\n\"Internally at Oregon the walk-ons are no different,\" said his father, Jeff Alie. \"The only difference between this guy and that guy is that guy has to write a check for tuition.\"\n***\nThere are many reasons why Alie is unfazed by his lack of a scholarship. For one, he says the benefits of being a part of the team at Oregon are countless. For another, his long honed self-awareness leaves his mind devoid of animosity.\n► When Alie was a neophyte quarterback in eighth grade, his father Jeff asked him to size up another player competing for the position. Jeff Alie recalled him answering, \"Dad, I have enough to work on myself.\"\n► After his senior high school season, when he had quarterbacked nearby Sheldon High School to an Oregon 6A championship, Alie and his parents were invited to visit the Ducks' football offices and talk with the coaching staff about an offer to walk on the next fall. Before they left campus, Jeff Alie said to his son, \"Hey buddy, do you think — \" and Taylor cut him off.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. \"You were going to ask me if I thought I was ever going to take a live snap in Autzen Stadium,\" Alie said to his father. \"Yes.\"\n► When Alie engaged in his first spring practice in 2013, it wasn't long before he said to himself, \"I know I can play with these guys.\"\n\"When I first got here, it was testing the waters, can I compete at this level?\" Alie said this week. \"And I found that out my freshman year. I kind of realized nothing was out of reach.\"\n► Earlier this season, when it became apparent Alie would begin seeing playing time at quarterback, his father asked him, \"Hey, are you nervous?\"\nAlie responded, \"If I was nervous, I shouldn't be doing this. Nervous is for the unprepared.\"\nAlie credits early study of the Oregon playbook in 2012, his time as a scout team quarterback in 2013, and the constant throwing that every Ducks quarterback — regardless of pedigree, recruiting reputation and scholarship status — does in practice as preparing him for live game action.\nUSA TODAY\nThe Football Four Podcast breaks down Week 6's best matchups\nHe acted like a potential starting quarterback because Oregon looks at every quarterback on its roster as a potential starter. \"When a guy shows up, he doesn't wear a different jersey, he doesn't wear different shoes, he's on our team,\" Oregon coach Mark Helfrich said.\nFor better or worse, the possibilities for the position seem endless in the first year post-Marcus Mariota at Oregon. Preseason camp began with Lockie looking like the most likely starter, Adams trying to complete his graduate transfer requirements and Alie making sure that whenever, however or whatever reason why his number might be called, he would answer.\nThough neither Alie nor Lockie expected to be sharing snaps based on gameplans that change by the week, an arrangement that on Monday Lockie said is not ideal, they agree that the atmosphere in the Oregon quarterbacks meeting room has been marked by encouragement, not competition.\n\"We're all positive toward each other, because we know at any point one of us could be out there,\" Alie said. \"And so to have animosity between us would ultimately tear down our group and our team.\n\"It's so easy for us to be discouraged, without knowing the rotation and not knowing the starter, but we don't look at it that way, and that's for the betterment of the team.\"\n***\nTo Helfrich, no quarterback in the preseason was more comfortable in Oregon's wide array of packages than Alie. \"Taylor had a fantastic camp,\" he said.\nAnd even though Alie has not been flawless in his intermittent opportunities during the regular season, he has had his moments, particular in contributing the kind of explosive plays that have been an Oregon trademark in recent years.\nOregon sophomore Taylor Alie (12) had just three fewer scholarship offers than Marcus Mariota (8) did when they each chose Oregon. (Photo: Scott Olmos, USA TODAY Sports)\nAn 87-yard touchdown run against Georgia State in the Ducks' second game, a 14-yard TD run in the Ducks' horrendous loss to Utah and a 43-yard touchdown pass last week at Colorado have brought him far more attention in his hometown than any of his 20 games as Oregon's holder have. They also are some of the reasons the Oregon staff is weighing Alie as a real option at quarterback while Adams recovers from a broken right index finger.\nIt adds a thrilling dimension to his parents' longtime relationship with the school and football program — Jeff and Robyn Alie are Oregon graduates and 25-year season ticketholders — that they could hardly have imagined.\nIn a way, Helfrich could hardly imagine it, too.\n\"I couldn't believe he came here,\" he said. \"I really couldn't. I couldn't believe he didn't get a scholarship somewhere else. And it was one of those deals where we're sitting around watching his film and you start to put in your mind, That guy's going to end up at wherever. And then for whatever reason, doesn't end up getting a scholarship.\n\"Marcus Mariota had one scholarship offer when we offered him a scholarship. So that's one scholarship away from being a walk-on in some ways.\n\"Taylor was a guy who ran around really well, he's tough, he's smart, he's got great intangibles, and we have very high expectations of him.\"\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM WEEK 6 IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL\nOhio offensive lineman Mike McQueen takes the field prior to the game against Miami, Ohio.
