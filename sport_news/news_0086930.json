Sophomore goalie Madison Mikula earned the shutout with a six-save effort, including a diving stop to the right post to preserve the shutout with just over three minutes left. \n\"We actually played really good team defense,\" T-burg coach Scott Stewart said. \"Our outside midfielders did a good job of carrying the ball down the side and crossing it in. Our center mids played really well, too, they kept the ball at their feet and controlled the pace of the game. I think that was the difference in the game, really.\" \nThe Bobcats (9-7-1), who got a yeoman 20-save effort from sophomore keeper Megan Palmatier, didn't get off the bus till around 3 p.m. for a 3:30 start, and Stewart thought that played a role in the visitors' slow start. \n\"That first score really made a difference, and it looked like B-G wasn't really into the game,\" he said. \"They got here late, and I think they were a little flat when they came out. And then once they got behind 3-0, that was kind of hard for them. And having a two-hour bus ride, that didn't help.\" \nThe Blue Raiders extended their win streak to three games since losing back-to-back games to sectional powers Dryden and Lansing, and are primed for a rematch with top-seeded Elmira Notre Dame, who advanced on Friday with a 7-0 victory over Sidney. The 15th-ranked Crusaders topped T-burg in the final of the Lady Crusader Tournament in mid-September, and Stewart relishes the opportunity for another shot at them. \n\"We're coming at a good time,\" he said. \"We really want to get back to playing (Notre Dame) again and showing them what we can do. I respect Steve (Weber, END coach) and the program over there tremendously, they have a really good program. To go over there and give them some hell, so to speak, that's our goal.\" \nLansing 2, Groton 0: At Lansing, Megan Dean and Liz Barre scored first-half goals and the Bobcat defense neutralized Indians leading scorer Sidney Reeves to advance to Tuesday's Class C semifinals. \nKassie Riemer assisted on both goals for Lansing (12-4-1), which outshot Groton, 18-2, and had a 6-3 edge in corners. Lena Gisler stopped both shots she saw for the winners, while Paige Graham had 14 saves for Groton.

And the Reeves sisters (Sidney and Lauren) gave us fits.\" \nSidney Reeves nearly cut the deficit to one goal for the Indians (10-6) with a free kick in the late going, from about 20 yards out, but she put the ball over the crossbar. \"I thought it was going to be 2-1.\" \nLansing, the defending sectional champ and last year's state Class C runner-up, will take on either third seed Unadilla Valley or sixth seed Marathon at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in Lansing. The championship game is next Friday in Norwich.
