(AP Photo/Clint Hughes) more > By STEVE DOUGLAS - Associated Press - Thursday, October 22, 2015 \nMANCHESTER, England (AP) - Louis van Gaal was careful to downplay talk of a permanent power shift in Manchester after United’s 4-2 victory over City in the most recent derby game. \nOld Trafford was rocking that evening in April. After four straight losses to its neighbor, United finally owned local bragging rights. City was on a downward spiral - behind its neighbor in the standings, its title defense in tatters and with manager Manuel Pellegrini’s job under serious pressure. \nBut Van Gaal wasn’t getting carried away, and he was right. \nSince that painful loss six months ago, the blue half of Manchester has recovered to remain the dominant force in the city - as they have been since the end of Alex Ferguson’s 26-year tenure at United in 2013. \nCity won six straight games after that derby to finish the Premier League nine points above United and in second place. \nAfter two months of this season, City is in first place, the top scorer in the division and the favorite to capture the title for the third time in five years. \nThe derby mauling in April seems a distant memory now as City heads back to Old Trafford on Sunday for the 161st Manchester derby, the headline game in the 10th round of Premier League fixtures. \nThe momentum seems to be with Pellegrini’s men, who have won their last two league games 6-1 and 5-1. City also had the advantage of playing at home in the Champions League on Wednesday - beating Sevilla 2-1 - while United had to travel back from a game in Moscow on the same night. \nHowever, United is at home - where it is unbeaten this season and has won seven of eight games - and has the incentive of potentially going top of the league with a win. United is third, tied for points with second-place Arsenal but behind on goal difference. \nArsenal is at home to Everton on Saturday. \nHere are some things to know ahead of this weekend’s games: \n___ \n‘PERFECT’ DE BRUYNE \nThe absence of striker Sergio Aguero and playmaker David Silva, who were injured during the recent international break, has robbed City of its two most influential attacking players for the derby. But in Kevin Bruyne, City has one of the most in-form players in the league, proving so far that he’s worth the 55 million pounds ($85 million) the club spent to make him its record signing. \nPellegrini even called him the “perfect” signing after De Bruyne scored an injury-time winner against Sevilla on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:17:04.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
