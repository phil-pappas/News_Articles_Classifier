Robyn Gabel; Michael Anthony, the chief diversity officer at Oakton Community College; and Maria Hadden, project manager for the Participatory Budgeting Project.\nLincolnwood, bring back the global flag display Angie Leventis Lourgos Five dozen flags representing the ethnicities and nationalities of my hometown used to wave from its streetlights in August, an annual tribute to the rich multiculturalism of north suburban Lincolnwood.\nBut this summer, those symbols of heritage remain in a storage room in the village public works...\nFive dozen flags representing the ethnicities and nationalities of my hometown used to wave from its streetlights in August, an annual tribute to the rich multiculturalism of north suburban Lincolnwood.\nBut this summer, those symbols of heritage remain in a storage room in the village public works...\n(Angie Leventis Lourgos) Some of the ideas posed during the conference were to hold casual coffee sessions to help residents feel more open to sharing their ideas with village officials and to consider the \"Participatory Budgeting Project,\" a budgeting process used in some Wards in Chicago that gives citizens a direct voice in allocating public money.\nSponsored by Winnetka-based Open Communities—an organization that advocates for social injustice and fair housing opportunities, the goal of the conference was to provide North Shore communities with ideas for embracing diversity.\nParticipatory budgeting allows citizens to decide where and how to spend public funds—allowing residents to get a bigger stake in local spending by voting on which projects public money should be spent on.\nAt the end of the conference, communities were divided into breakout sessions to start planning the details of their campaigns for embracing diversity.\nThe consensus for Skokie and Lincolnwood, according to Gayle Schecter, executive director for Open Communities, was to encourage leaders to get to know the diverse groups of people who live in the communities they represent.\nLincolnwood suspends controversial diversity celebration Natalie Hayes For the first time in 11 years, Lincolnwood officials have suspended the village's annual diversity month.\nThe village's tradition of displaying flags each August during diversity month along Lincoln Avenue had come under fire last summer when some residents claimed they were offended by the Palestinian...\nFor the first time in 11 years, Lincolnwood officials have suspended the village's annual diversity month.\nThe village's tradition of displaying flags each August during diversity month along Lincoln Avenue had come under fire last summer when some residents claimed they were offended by the Palestinian...\n(Natalie Hayes) \"The bottom line for Lincolnwood and Skokie is that they're diverse,\" Schecter said. \"People don't always know each other, so their prejudices are built on ignorance and a lack of opportunities to meet each other.\"\nTurry said he and Kohn would bring some ideas from the Justice Summit back to the Human Relations Commission to help build a multifaceted program for addressing diversity in the community.\nLincolnwood's long-running tradition of displaying a row of about 60 flags along Lincoln Avenue each August in honor of the village's \"Diversity Month\" came under fire last year when some residents took offense to the presence of the Palestinian flag.\nRelations between Palestine and Israel were at a boiling point in late 2014, and the village defended the right of the Palestinian flag to continue flying after a handful of residents sounded off against it being included in the display during a public meeting attended by hundreds of residents.\nThe August 2014 meeting grew so heated at one point that accusations of discrimination and even terrorism flew between angry community members, prompting Lincolnwood Mayor Jerry Turry to threaten to throw people out of village hall.\nThe flag display was absent from Lincoln Avenue this past August due to a public works project, but Lincolnwood officials have not said whether the tradition would continue again next year or whether new activities to celebrate the community's diversity would begin.\nNatalie Hayes is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.\n Lincolnwood Robyn Gabel", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-553ba4a8/turbine/ct-lwr-flag-canceled-tl-0430-20150424", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55cec817/turbine/ct-palestinian-flag-lincolnwood-met-20150813", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d1f7f/turbine/ct-lwr-diversity-month-tl-1015-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:28:55.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
