This will enable pan-India real-time transmission of imagery and enemy targets. The work on both is underway and is running concurrently. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshall Arup Raha, addressing a press conference in the National Capital yesterday, explained the contours of this technology leap that is underway. “We will have enough satellites for communication, navigation, targeting and imagery. Four of the IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) have been launched and a total of seven will be launched,” he said. The IRNSS is an independent regional navigation satellite system run by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and will provide encrypted service. The space-based system will be implemented in phases and all are running concurrently, the IAF chief said. On being asked if the space-based system will have an offensive capability, the IAF chief said “that I am not able to tell you as of now”. China has an offensive space-based technology and the US has red-flagged this issue. Raha listed out the second aspect of the network capabilities. “In 2-3 years time, we will be fully networked. The government has approved the IACCCS (integrated air command, control and communications system)”. The IACCS, which was functioning on the western front, would soon cover the air space over the entire country and island territories by integrating all resources, said Raha. Sources said the system was a combination of surveillance platforms and integrated the ability to use data and images in real-time across many battlefields. This is an IAF-owned, operated, fully secure, reliable network that will use the AF-Net an optic-fibre based network created in collaboration with US-based Cisco Systems, HCL Infosystems Ltd and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. The IACCS, by using the AFNet, will receive at a central place, direct real-time feeds from existing space-based overhead reconnaissance satellites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:35:43.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
