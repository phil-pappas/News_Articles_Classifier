That’s not like us. We’ve got to get that fixed. We probably gave up 15 points on special teams.”\nThankfully, what Utah’s special teams gave away, the Ute defense wrestled back.\n“Our defense didn’t let them into the end zone,” Whittingham said. “Bottom line, our defense gave up nothing. Proud of them. They were collectively the player of the game for us.”\nThe trouble began when Utes gave up a 100-yard kickoff return to Tim White just four seconds after they scored their first touchdown.\nWhen the subsequent drive stalled, Tom Hackett booted a punt 56 yards, but a holding penalty forced him to make the kick again. ASU’s De’Chavon Hayes looked like he was going to get all the way into the end zone until Hackett brought him down on the 13-yard line. That led to Zane Gonzalez' first of three field goals, and ASU’s first lead, 10-7.\nThe worst of the disappointing plays came in the third quarter right after Utah’s defense forced ASU to settle for a field goal. With a 14-13 lead, freshman Britain Covey caught the kickoff deep in the end zone and then turned and threw what was later ruled an illegal forward pass that fell short of its intended receiver, Bubba Poole. It was ruled a safety, and the Sun Devils took a 15-14 lead.\n“The plan was, I catch it deep, fake like I’m going to run up, stop right before the goal line and then throw a backwards pass to Bubba and he goes,” Covey said. “It worked in practice; that was a really bad throw.”\nCovey said he was relieved his teammates rallied from the mistake.\n“I really am overwhelmed,” he said. “Not as much for me and how we finished, but it’s when I came off the sideline after that stupid play, I didn’t hear one negative thing from any one of my teammates. I just appreciated that.” Linebacker and team captain Gionni Paul said earlier in the postgame press conference that Saturday night’s victory was a team effort.\n“It’s a little frustrating for sure, because (special teams) is something we pride ourselves on here at Utah,” Covey said. “It’s nothing we can’t fix. I know we’re going to evaluate things. It was tough tonight to have that be the weakness.”\nEmail: adonaldson@deseretnews.com\nTwitter: adonsports", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639307%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445212449", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639307%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445212449", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639307%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445212450", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639307%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445212450"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:04:29.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
