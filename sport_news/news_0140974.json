(Image Source: Brett Carlsen/Getty Images) \nHere’s a look at what we learned in Week 4: \n1) Leonard Fournette Is Your 2015 Heisman Trophy Winner \nA week after rushing for 228 yards against Auburn, LSU RB Leonard Fournette put up 244 yards in the Carrier Dome. If not for an illegal formation penalty (WR was lined up behind the line of scrimmage) that wiped out an 87-yard TD run, the super sophomore could have gone for over 300 yards. The kid has it all…vision, power, breakaway speed, wiggle in the open field and patience. The only thing that could stop him from going for 2,000 yards this season is carries, or lack thereof, against inferior foes. \n2) But…I Still Don’t Believe in Brandon Harris \nAs good as Leonard Fournette is, LSU will need better quarterback play if they are going to win the SEC West and I’m don’t trust Brandon Harris with that task. He is way too inconsistent and inaccurate with his throws. Despite his talented WRs, Harris was just 8 of 16 passing in the Dome and is averaging a mere 100.3 yards per game through the air. That won’t work in today’s football. They’ll be 7-0 but that’s not good enough to beat Alabama or Ole Miss, maybe not even Texas A&M or Arkansas. Just as poor QB play has held back talented LSU teams in the past—see Jordan Jefferson and Jarrett Lee —more talented LSU teams by the way, so will the QB play this season. \n3) TCU Isn’t the Third-Best Team the Country \nTechnically, in the Coaches Poll they are—they’re 4 th in the AP Poll—but it says here they are not one of the three or four best teams in the country. Not with that defense, regardless of how Gary Patterson wants to spin things. I’m sorry Fort Worth. QB Trevone Boykin (485 yards, 4 TDs) may win the Heisman. WR Josh Doctson may win the Biletnikoff Award. They’re special, no one is debating that, but the Horned Frogs aren’t winning a national championship. Not with a defense that allowed 52 points and 607 yards to Texas Tech on Saturday. They’ve simply lost too many players on D, so there really isn’t much hope that they will improve significantly, not enough to be among the top three or even five teams in the country. Between Texas (yeah, I said Texas), Kansas State, West Virginia, Oklahoma State, Oklahoma and Baylor, I see multiple losses in TCU’s future. \n4) Either Arkansas or Auburn Will Not Go Bowling (Maybe Neither) \nWhen the season started Auburn was No. 6 in the AP Poll, No. 7 in the Coaches Poll and the SEC media’s pick to win the conference, while Arkansas was a trendy team to make a major leap, starting the year ranked No. 18 in the AP Poll and No. 20 in the Coaches Poll. One month into the season and Auburn is 2-2, Arkansas is 1-3 and have you looked at the schedules? \nNeeding five wins to become bowl eligible, the Razorbacks still have to play at Tennessee (10/3), at No. 13 Alabama (10/10), vs. Auburn (10/24), at No. 3 Ole Miss (11/7), at No. 9 LSU (11/14), vs. No. 21 Mississippi State (11/21) and vs. defending SEC East champ Missouri (11/27). Assuming they beat Tennessee Martin, do you really see four wins in the seven aforementioned games? I don’t. \nAuburn has two wins and will probably need to win at Arkansas to have a chance to reach six. With games against San Jose State and Idaho remaining the Tigers will get at least two more Ws. But their other games come at 3-1 Kentucky (10/15), at Arkansas (10/24), vs. No. 3 Ole Miss (10/31), at No. 14 Texas A&M (11/7), vs. No. 8 Georgia (11/14) and vs. No. 13 Alabama (11/28). Unless they upset the Razorbacks at Arkansas I don’t believe Auburn is getting to six wins either, which could mean both teams will see their seasons—ones that had so much promise four weeks ago—end prematurely. \n5) The Afternoon Docket Needs to Get Better \nCollege football needs to do better than UMass at Notre Dame on NBC and Western Michigan @ Ohio State on ABC at 3:30. Sure, Tennessee @ Florida, TCU @ Texas Tech (4:45 start on FOX) and Oklahoma State @ Texas were barnburners. There will always be exciting games. But what I want is some exciting matchups that get fans pumped up when they check the guide. It was even worse at noon when the only game approaching a “marquee matchup” was BYU @ Michigan, but sadly that has come to be expected. Hopefully, when conference play starts it will improve. The best games on Saturday afternoon were all conference games after all. How about some big games on during the day for my single buddies out there who like to go out on Saturday night? \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
