(lehighvalleylive.com file photo) By Kyle Craig | For lehighvalleylive.com on September 30, 2015 11:30 AM View/Post Comments \nBoston University was at the top of Mackenzie Miers ’ wish list before the Easton Area High School junior was on the Terriers’ radar. \nThe girls basketball player circled the school while researching possible destinations early this past summer. Boston University targeted Miers a few weeks later at an AAU tournament in Chicago. \nTuesday night, Miers’ wish list turned into a checklist as she verbally committed to the Division I program. \nThe root of the 6-foot-3 post player’s choice doesn’t come from the hardwood; it comes from the classroom. Mackenzie Miers (lehighvalleylive.com file photo) \n“Academics, that was kind of the main part of my decision,” said Miers, who wants to study communication and journalism. “I wanted to go to a place that was going to give me the best opportunity for what I want to do … Being in Boston, being in the city, will just open so many doors for me.” \nBoston University, which plays in the Patriot League with Lafayette and Lehigh, gives Miers an opportunity to play college games in the Lehigh Valley while still getting a chance to set out on her own. \n“I’ll be able to play in the area, but I’ll still go away from home and get an opportunity to grow up a little bit … and be independent,” she said. \nThe Terriers staff took notice of the Easton junior while she played with the Lehigh Valley Fever in the Nike National Invitational Tournament in July. The Fever went 6-0 during that trip to Chicago. \nRELATED : Lehigh Valley Fever AAU girls basketball team has perfect Chicago trip \nMiers, who also considered William & Mary and Lehigh, was impressed with the effort the BU coaches made to connect with her. \n“(Head coach Katy Stedling) has been amazing though this entire process,” she said. “I already feel like, in some ways, she’s become like a mom to me.” \nThe Red Rover’s path to a Division I commitment was hardly traditional. Miers, who averaged about six points per game as a sophomore, has only been playing basketball for three years – starting the sport in eighth grade after giving up swimming. \nWith her physical attributes and relatively small amount of experience, “upside” could probably be one of the first words on Miers’ recruiting bio. \nBefore BU can continue her development, of course, Miers still has plenty of work to put in with Easton and the Fever. She indicated that, while she enjoyed the recruiting process, her mind is clear to focus on school and the basketball immediately ahead of her. \n“Now that I’ve decided where I’d like to go 100 percent, and I’ve actually made that commitment, there’s so much pressure released off my shoulders,” the junior said. \nMiers, who is part of a talented Class of 2017 at Easton, including Gabby Bloshuk, Shelby Stocker and Olivia George, was adamant about deflecting the credit for her commitment to the people around her. \n“I want my team to be in the spotlight,” she said. “I want this to be all about my team … I would not be in the position that I am without them.” \nAnd it’s just the position that Mackenzie Miers wished for. Proud to say that I'll still be wearing red and white in college because I've just committed to Boston University🐾🏀 pic.twitter.com/1q90cPpSJg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:33:36.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
