She ran with the Syriza dissidents of Popular Unity, which failed to enter Parliament.\nAwaiting the new Parliament is an intense legislative activity to pass reforms required by the 86-billion-euro ($96 billion) third bailout.\nVoutsis, Interior minister in the first Tsipras government from January to August 2015, is expected to adhere closer to the speaker's traditional role, in contrast to Konstantopoulou, who commented, often disapprovingly, on almost every lawmaker's contribution and whose long speeches resembled political manifestos.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
