When the council approved the agreement, however, it added language committing the county to pick up part of the pay raise package. On Sept. 11, the county pulled language related to the pay raises from the latest version of the agreement. Since then, the city has declined to act on the revised document, citing uncertainty about the county’s willingness to participate in the raises.\nTo try to bring an end to the stalemate earlier this month, commission Chairman Al Scott attended a meeting of the City Council, where he assured Savannah officials he was in support of the pay increases and agreed to convene the policy committee to discuss the matter.\nBy this week, Scott said, his staff had determined that the county’s true share of the costs for 2015 — a figure he said incorporated each government’s share of the police department’s costs and the average vacancies from July to December — was $246,515.99.\nSavannah City Manager Stephanie Cutter, however, countered that his proposal double-counted the vacancies, and the true cost to the county for the second half of 2015 is just more than $279,000.\nScott, showing political maturity, quickly agreed to the revised figure presented by Cutter. He said the difference didn’t matter because the cost figures will be reconciled at the end of the year, which is only proper. He said the county commission would vote on the recommended agreement as early as next week.\nAlthough the City Council had been waiting for the county to show interest in the pay increases prior to approving the police merger agreement, the council did not take up the merger agreement when it met Thursday.\nWhy not? The agreement has been studied to death by council and commission members since they first reached a framework for the agreement in May, five months ago. Neither side has shined during these negotiations. A reasonable person might think the city council would want to get this behind them as soon as possible.\nOr are some city officials playing election year politics?\nThe council has only one more opportunity to vote on the agreement. Their last meeting before the Nov. 3 election is on Oct. 29. Are they punting their decision-making down the road? Or could it be the council is playing a game of chicken, to see if the county will approve the agreement? City voters have the right to know whether their elected leaders value their public safety, and who will pay for it. The council should vote for this agreement Oct. 29, regardless of the county’s vote.\nAs we’ve said before, this entire mess is one more argument in favor of consolidating city and county governments, which other similarly sized communities in Georgia have already done. In fact, Savannah and Chatham County are conspicuously alone in maintaining their dual, expensive and uncoordinated governments. Even Macon and Bibb County junked the old way of supporting two bureaucracies and two subsets of ego-centric politicians and consolidating. Yet the leadership in Chatham and Savannah is so awful, they spend more than a year negotiating a public safety contract while violent crime skyrockets in both the city and unincorporated areas of the county.
