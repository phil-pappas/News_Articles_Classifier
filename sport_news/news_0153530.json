Heard was rushed into duty when Tyrone Swoopes struggled to start the season and Heard is definitely an upgrade for the Longhorns. The freshman has passed for 661 yards, two touchdowns and an interception this season. He has added 318 yards and three touchdowns with his feet.\nD'Onta Foreman, sophomore running back. Foreman is the biggest running threat outside of Heard on this Longhorns' roster. The redshirt sophomore is averaging just under five yards per carry for a total of 211 yards and two touchdowns this season.\nDaje Johnson, senior wide receiver. In addition to leading Texas with 14 receptions, Johnson is dangerous as a punt returner. He averages 17.6 yards per return including his 85-yard touchdown return against Rice. He returns kickoffs as well so look for him all over the field on Saturday for Texas. All his duties make Johnson the clear leader for Texas with 574 all-purpose yards.\nMalik Jefferson, freshman linebacker. A highly-touted recruit out of high school, Jefferson enrolled at Texas in January and is already having an impact on the field for the Longhorns. Jefferson already has 31 tackles on the season, including 3.5 tackles for loss. He is still trying to break through with his first collegiate sack but with five quarterback hurries under his belt that sack cannot be far away for Jefferson.\nDylan Haines, junior safety. Haines led Texas in interceptions and was second on the team in pass breakups as a sophomore and is following up that performance nicely. He already has two interceptions and another pass breakup in 2015. Haines is a strong tackler and also is capable of getting after the quarterback and recording a sack.\nPeter Jinkens, senior linebacker. Jinkens, a former Dallas Skyline product, is putting together his best collegiate season yet as a senior. He was just a part-time starter as a sophomore and a junior but this season Jinkens is leading Texas in total tackles (40) and tackles for loss (four). Jinkens is strong in the run game and can put pressure on the quarterback, too.\nJohn Burt, freshman wide receiver. Burt is a pleasant surprise this season for Charlie Strong and staff as he was not expected to contribute right away as a freshman. But Burt is not only contributing but leading the Longhorns in receiving yards with 222. His 69-yard touchdown catch against Rice showed that Burt can be a deep-ball threat.\nHassan Ridgeway, junior defensive tackle. Originally a defensive end, Ridgeway converted to tackle after his redshirt season and is starting to break through as a junior. After starting the season on the bench Ridgeway has started the past two games for Texas and is putting together a solid season with 19 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and a fumble recovery.\nJohnathan Gray, senior running back. Gray is a strong runner with 204 yards on the ground and three rushing touchdowns to his name this season. But the senior is also a threat to catch the ball out of the backfield with five receptions for 79 yards in 2015.\nDuke Thomas, senior cornerback. Thomas is in his second full season as a starter. He is an able tackler even in the run game and is one of Texas' better cover corners, though you wouldn't know it by watching him go up against TCU's Josh Doctson last weekend .\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-10-06T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:23:54.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
