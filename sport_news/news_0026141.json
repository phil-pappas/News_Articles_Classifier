Reigning Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson had three assists.\nJoffrey Lupul, Tyler Bozak, Peter Holland and Daniel Winnik had the Leafs goals as they made good on their vow to be better after falling behind.\nToronto goaltender James Reimer, vying to replace Jonathan Bernier as the starter, stopped 29 of the 33 shots he faced.\nAfter the Leafs dominated the play in a scoreless first period, Turris opened the scoring 46 seconds into the second. As four Toronto penalty killers converged on the boards, Karlsson found Turris wide open in the slot for a goal in his 400th NHL game.\nChiasson scored a less-traditional power-play goal 3:38 in, stepping out of the penalty box to score on a breakaway and make it 2-0 Ottawa.\nThe Senators made it 3 for their first 3 on the power play at 4:56 when Michalek corralled a rebound of a shot by Karlsson and beat Reimer in front.\nWith Winnik pressuring, Ottawa defenceman Patrick Wiercioch turned the puck over right to Lupul at 7:05 as the Leafs scored their first even-strength goal of the season.\nBozak made it two when captain Dion Phaneuf made a perfect stretch pass up the middle of the ice at 14:33 of the second.\nAfter Holland tied it with some nifty stick work in front on the power play 3:18 into the third, Stone deflected Mike Hoffman's shot past Reimer at 8:59 to restore Ottawa's lead.\nBut the Leafs weren't done, as Winnik scored at 16:21 to tie the score again. Referee Kevin Pollack waved it off when it first happened, but the situation room looked at it, asked for the horn to blow to stop play and ruled the puck went in.\nNotes â€” Roman Polak and Michael Grabner made their Leafs debuts, replacing Scott Harrington and Shawn Matthias. The team announced Matthias was day-to-day with an upper-body injury. ... The Senators play host to the Montreal Canadiens on Sunday.\n---\nFollow @SWhyno on Twitter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:10:44.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
