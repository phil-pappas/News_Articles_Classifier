And they may been cleaning the floors this week, dealing with insurance all week,\" said Erick Hedrick, owner of Bengals and Bandits. \"Maybe their house was impacted, so when I lay my head on the pillow Saturday I want to feel good about what I've done. So we're going to allocate some sort of percentage from our sales that day to a family owned store like ours up in Columbia.\"\nThe spirit of why this game is happening here is clearly not lost on the people of Baton Rouge. It is one reason why the Tiger faithful will undoubtedly support Gamecock nation this weekend.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
