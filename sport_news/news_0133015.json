I’ve just been telling everybody I feel really good about the way we came out and jumped on this team and played great almost every snap.”\nCameron Holmes scored three touchdowns and the Burke County defense surrendered only 89 yards as the Bears moved to 6-2 overall and 1-1 in Region 3-AAAA.\nBoth the offensive and defensive lines controlled the game.\nThe Bears met few if any obstacles in the romp, winning the yard battle 272-20 at the half and the score 34-0 to bring a running clock for the entire second half.\nOnly one week after falling seven yards short of the end zone in a just-missed rally from 14 down at Liberty County, Burke County scored on five of six first-half possessions.\nWhen Windsor Forest (1-6, 0-2) had the ball, it didn’t keep it long. Burke County clogged the lanes and stepped forward to stuff runs.\nThe Knights didn’t pick up a first down until 3:39 remained in the first half. They also had the same amount of penalty yards as offensive yards (20) in the opening two quarters.\n— Wayne Staats, Morris News Service\nWF 0 0 0 0 — 0\nBC 13 21 7 7 — 48\nBC—Cameron Holmes 1 run (Jeremy Tinley kick)\nBC—Holmes 2 run (kick failed)\nBC—Holmes 33 pass from Caleeb Roberson (Tinley kick)\nBC—Marcello Snelling 21 run (Tinley kick)\nBC—Damari Kelly 20 run (Tinley kick)\nBC—Quan Wilson 20 pass from Kelly (Tinley kick)\nBC—Fumble return (Tinley kick)", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:17:10.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
