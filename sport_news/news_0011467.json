Palakasan na lang. That’s not basketball to me. Play the ball and not the man,” said Narvasa.\nProof of Narvasa’s plan to be hands on in overseeing the training of the referees is his decision not to hire a new technical supervisor.\n“Yung mga referees kasi noon madalas napapagalitan at nasisigawan. Minsan namumura pa so yung mga referees hindi masyado gumagaling. Ako binabaligtad ko. I’ll be the one to do it. I want them to learn from the point of view of the coaches and the players,” said Narvasa.\nNarvasa, however, is asking for patience from the players and coaches as it will take time before they get to meet their common objective.\n“The commissioner and the referees are not your adversaries. Help us improve the quality of the ballgames as we try to improve the efficiency of the calls of the referees,” said Narvasa.\nNarvasa said players and coaches will be given evaluation sheets to help the PBA office assess the referees.\nMeantime, Narvasa revealed they will now include a “Referee’s Corner” segment in their website to make people understand and be informed about changes in officiating.\n“If there’s any controversial call or any need for explanation for certain rule changes we will put it there. It’s not going to be any kind of debate. Just a clarification what the rules are,” said Narvasa.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:26:40.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
