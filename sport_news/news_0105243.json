The Cowboys visit MetLife Stadium on Sunday and Flowers is expected to see a lot of star defensive end Greg Hardy, who was suspended and did not play when the teams met in the regular-season opener.\nHardy spent the final 15 games on the commissioner’s exempt list last season with the Panthers, and served a four-game suspension to begin this season related to a May 2014 domestic violence incident.\nHe has played one game with the Cowboys and made his presence felt, albeit in a losing effort, by sacking Tom Brady twice, including a blind-side hit just six defensive snaps into the game two weeks ago.\nHardy was asked by reporters in Dallas after practice Wednesday how the Cowboys plan to disrupt Manning’s rhythm.\n\"Hit him in the mouth,\" Hardy said. \"The best thing for any defense is to make the quarterback feel pain. You’ve got to be respectful of the rules of the game, and honestly you don’t want to hurt anybody, but to make him feel you is to bring his eyes down.\n\"You don’t want a quarterback like Eli Manning looking down the field, ever. Ever, ever, ever.\"\nManning was sacked four times in the first five games, but just once by the Hardy-less Cowboys. He was sacked three times by the Eagles and was under constant duress in Philadelphia on Monday night, twice earning penalties for intentional grounding.\n\"They’ve got a good defensive front, so we’ve got to do a good job mixing up our protections, getting the ball out quick, some play-action, run the ball well,\" said Manning, who was sacked three times by Hardy when the Giants lost to Carolina in the 2013 season. \"I think we’ll be in good shape. If we’re moving the ball and getting first downs, getting completions, you get hit sometimes playing this game.\"\nThe Giants have struggled with speed rushers off the edge, when opponents can take aim at Manning without the threat of a running game. Cowboys rookie defensive end Randy Gregory and Hardy certainly possess that and then some.\nGregory is expected to return after missing the last four games because of a high-ankle sprain suffered against the Giants. In that game, he had three quarterback pressures.\nThe Giants own the distinction of being the last team in the NFL without a 100-yard rusher in a game this season.\n\"You know what? We’ve got to pick ourselves up and get back on track and recognize the strength of their defensive front,\" Giants coach Tom Coughlin said.\nWas it easy for Flowers to speak up despite his inexperience?\n\"Just when needed,\" he said.\nThe Giants need even more come Sunday, and they’re counting on their first-round pick to step up again.\nSaid Flowers: \"We’ve got a lot of hungry dudes right now going into this game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:01:03.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
