It was a wild, back-and-forth game that PSU didn't clinch until a 27-yard field by Jonathan Gonzales with 33 seconds left.\nThe Vikings play at home this Saturday -- 2:05 p.m., Providence Park -- against traditional Big Sky powerhouse Montana. The Grizzlies usually bring a big group of fans along with them. It will be interesting to see how many PSU fans turn out for what should be critical game for the Vikings' postseason hopes.\n-- The Oregon State Beavers lost their most winnable remaining game Saturday at home to Colorado, 17-13.\nI actually thought the OSU defense played pretty well. But the Beavers' offense remains a work in progress. Neither Seth Collins nor Nick Mitchell looks like the kind of complete, dual-threat quarterback that coach Gary Andersen wants to have running his offense.\nI think it's clear that the remainder of Oregon State's 2015 season will be more about setting the table for 2016 than anything else.\n-- The Pac-12 might be the country's strongest, overall conference. But it's light at the top, and that could shut the Pac-12 out of the College Football Playoff.\nIt didn't help the conference's playoff hopes for Utah get blown out by USC. Now, I think Stanford probably needs to run the table if the Pac-12 is to receive one of the four berths. I don't think that will be easy.\nThis, of course, is one of many reasons I believe the playoff field should be expanded.\n -- Ken Goe\nkgoe@oregonian.com\n503-221-8040 | @KenGoe", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KenGoe"], "published": "2015-10-26T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:23:02.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
