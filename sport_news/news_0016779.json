While Smith was lamenting coming up five yards short of a pick-six, QB Bo Levi Mitchell finished the job on the very next play by finding Marquay McDaniel for the touchdown and an early lead. \nDown goes Tim Brown \nAfter returning from a right knee injury last week, the kick-return sparkplug went down again Saturday in the first half. Originally, trainers were looking at Brown's left knee, but then they also took a look at his back. The 5-foot-8, 190-pounder didn't return to the game and could be a question mark heading into the Stamps next game on Oct. 31. \"I'm not quite sure how extensive the injury is,\" Stamps GM/head coach John Hufnagel said. \"He has a little bit of a back problem and a knee problem, so I'm not sure.\" \nAnthony Parker fumbles punt \nWith Brown down, Anthony Parker got the first crack at punt-return duties and it did not go well. Parker fumbled his first opportunity in the second half, allowing Argos defensive back Matt Black to fall on the football at the Stamps' 30-yard line. A few plays later, a 17-0 lead for the Red & White was shaved to just 10 points and the Argos finally had a little bit of momentum. \nGlenn Love's first-career interception \nThat momentum was short-lived, however, as Love, who is filling in for injured captain Juwan Simpson, stepped in front of a Harris pass as the Argos were driving to take points off the board and preserve the cushion. A 17-14 game would've made things much more hairy for the Stamps down the stretch. \nTory Harrison provides the dagger \nFive minutes in to the fourth quarter, Harrison put on a show. After producing 17 rushing yards on a pair of touches to start the drive, Mitchell found Harrison out of the backfield and the former Indoor Football League star with the Iowa Barnstormers made Argos linebacker Thomas Miles whiff with a left trigger juke move and then dove for the pylon and the touchdown. Harrison is proving be a nice change-of-pace weapon for the Stampeders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:09:17.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
