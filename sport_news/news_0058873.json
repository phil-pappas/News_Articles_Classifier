The trust threatened to file a contempt petition if the orders were not implemented within two weeks. A Division Bench comprising Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan had, on June 4, 2015, passed the orders on a public interest litigation petition, directing the state universities -- Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Solan, Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla, and CSK Agriculture University, Palampur, to provide free education to physically challenged persons within six weeks. Even after two-and-half months, the university in Solan has not implemented the orders,\" said chairman of Umang Foundation Ajai Srivastav. \"Himachal Pradesh University had issued a notification in compliance with the orders on July 25 last while Agriculture University, Palampur, has proposed a full fee waiver and is in the process of issuing the notification but Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry was moving in a different direction and in case, the fresh notification was not issued, it would have to face contempt of court,\" Srivastav said. Terming it a glaring example of deliberate defiance of the High Court orders, Srivastav said the university had gone to the extent of saying that no tuition fee should be charged from those physically challenged students who were admitted under 3 per cent reservation quota.\" \"The tuition fee waiver has been there for years and the fresh notification mentioning free education to them has only reiterated the old rules, which is contempt of court,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:24:11.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
