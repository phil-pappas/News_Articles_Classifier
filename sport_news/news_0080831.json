Heading into the bottom of the sixth, Waynesville led 8-4, but a sacrifice hit, a RBI single by Kailyn Hazlewood and an error cut that lead to 8-7. The bottom of the seventh started out with a strikeout, but an error put the tying run on base. Things got worse when a throwing error on a sacrifice bunt attempt put the tying run on third and the winning run on first. As Cally Blattel came up to bat, Waynesville coach Kelly Jackson came out to talk with pitcher Macalah Danielsen. \"That was their key hitter,\" Jackson said.\"She strokes the ball so there was no other choice to put her on and make somebody else beat us.\" So, an intentional walk loaded the bases. Danielsen had one word to describe her feeling on the mound at that point. \"Dread.\" Then, the next batter hit a dribbler to her and the runners took off. \"I'm like, oh, crap, I have to make a good throw and do this again, start over with another count,\" Danielsen said. She made the toss to catcher Morgan Loggins and that's when Loggins decided to risk it and rifle the throw to first. And beat the runner by a step. Game ends with a 1-2-3 double play. Waynesville gets the top-seeded Camdenton Lady Lakers (21-4) Thursday at 4:30 p.m. The two teams played once during the regular season, on Sept. 21, and the Lakers took that one 6-1, but Jackson still believes anything can happen Thursday. \"We put runs on the board,\" she said. \"If we can play error-free ball, we're tough to beat. I think, right now, this district is up in the air. I think it's who can come out and play error-free ball and put the bat on the ball.\" The Lady Tigers did that Wednesday. Loggins got things started with a double to center to plate Emily Lucitt in the top of the first. Lebanon came back to tie the game in the bottom of the frame on an error. The Yellowjackets had an error of their own in the top of the second that scored Waynesville's Briauna Nave. Lucitt scored Danielsen on a single to the shortstop later in the inning to make it 3-1. Jordan Thormeyer continued to struggle on the mound in the bottom of the second for the Lady Tigers, walking a runner in after she had walked a pair and an error loaded the bases. That's when Jackson sent Danielsen out to pitch. Page 2 of 2 - \"Jordan Thormeyer came off an outstanding game against Joplin,\" Jackson said. \"She came out tonight and just couldn't find it. \"I'm looking to come back strong with her tomorrow. If she's on, it's a totally different game for us.\" A single and sacrifice fly pushed Lebanon ahead 4-3. The lead only lasted two batters as Jordan Kane smashed a home run to left center. Two innings later Afatia Poinsette and Nave had RBI singles and a throwing error that saw the ball airmailed over first scored two for the Lady Tigers to give them their 8-4 lead. Waynesville will likely have to score a lot of runs tomorrow night too, as the Lakers average nearly seven runs a game. \"Camdenton's a tough team,\" Jackson said. \"Kickapoo beat them Monday night (by 2-0). We beat Kickapoo pretty bad (10-4) and Kickapoo has beaten us (9-3). Like I said, it's who's going to show up to play.\" Danielsen thinks her team will be up for the challenge. \"We know it's going to be tough, but I think we're ready,\" Danielsen said. \"We need to be, all around, on top of our game. This is districts. I don't want to go home.\" By Derek Dueker   Derek Dueker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:29:07.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
