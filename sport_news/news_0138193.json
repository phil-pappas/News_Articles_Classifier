The winner of the game will represent CONCACAF at the 2017 Confederation’s Cup in Russia. The tournament is known to be a critical tune up for the 2018 World Cup also taking place in Russia, and will feature the best teams in the world.\nHere are three things to watch for in the do or die game against Mexico on Saturday night.\n1. The USMNT backline must be both cohesive and effective on Saturday night.\nUSMNT head coach Jurgen Klinsmann has released his roster (see bottom) for the game against Mexico. There are some surprise omissions, but the biggest task for the U.S. skipper is putting together an effective backline. Often times it’s not the best four defenders that leads to success, but the four defenders that play the best as a unit. That said, the likely choice for Klinsmann will be Geoff Cameron, Matt Besler, Fabian Johnson, and either Tim Ream or DaMarcus Beasley. There is also the issue of who will start in net on Saturday. Klinsmann has said Brad Guzan will be the guy, but it’s hard to forget what Tim Howard did in the World Cup, and is currently doing in the English Premiere League so far for Everton.\n2. Substitutes from Jurgen Klinsmann will be key factor in game.\nDepending on the formation that Klinsmann throws out on Saturday night, it will most likely be Clint Dempsey and Jozy Altidore up top in a 4-4-2. If that’s the case, two key players who have looked good in recent months, DeAndre Yedlin and Gyasi Zardes, could be on the bench to start. It’s imperative that Klinsmann gets either one or both in the game if the U.S. trail at halftime, with more than just 10 minutes left in regulation. On the other hand, if the U.S. hold a lead late, look for defensive substitutions in Beasley or Kyle Beckerman to enter the midfield.\n3. With a loss, what’s next for the USMNT?\nA loss here can be incredibly devastating to U.S. soccer and the “progress” it is supposed to be making since the hire of Klinsmann. Some might see a loss on Saturday night as a third strike for the German coach, who inexplicably left off Landon Donovan in the 2014 World Cup roster, along with a recent loss to Jamaica in a Gold Cup semifinal. Remember, former USMNT head coach Bob Bradley was relieved of his duties after a Gold Cup final loss to Mexico in 2011.\nUSMNT Roster\nGoalies: Brad Guzan (Aston Villa), Tim Howard (Everton), Nick Rimando (Real Salt Lake).\nDefenders: Ventura Alvarado (Club América), DaMarcus Beasley (Houston Dynamo), Matt Besler (Sporting Kansas City), Geoff Cameron (Stoke City), Brad Evans (Seattle Sounders), Fabian Johnson (Borussia Mönchengladbach), Michael Orozco (Club Tijuana), Tim Ream (Fulham), Jonathan Spector (Birmingham City).\nMidfielders: Kyle Beckerman (Real Salt Lake), Alejandro Bedoya (Nantes), Michael Bradley (Toronto FC), Jermaine Jones (New England Revolution), Danny Williams (Reading), DeAndre Yedlin (Sunderland), Graham Zusi (Sporting Kansas City)\nForwards: Jozy Altidore (Toronto FC), Clint Dempsey (Seattle Sounders), Chris Wondolowski (San Jose Earthquakes), Gyasi Zardes (LA Galaxy)\nStaff Writer: Chris Parker cparker@gannettnj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:26:45.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
