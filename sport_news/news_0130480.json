And the agony of defeat. Related Links: Talk about it in V. I. P. - 'MEMBERS ONLY' CLUB Longtime announcer Jim McKay profoundly declared that during ABC's Wide World of Sports. Oscar Smith's Tigers experienced the exhilaration of one, while Indian River's Braves felt the pain of the other. Down 12 late in the fourth quarter, the Tigers stormed back for a pair of touchdowns - the most dramatic coming on sophomore Deangelo White 's improbable 51-yard punt return with 24.7 seconds left to play - to edge Indian River 15-14 in front of a packed crowd at Hickory's Linda J. Byrd Stadium on Saturday afternoon in Chesapeake. \"I prayed before the kick and I felt it coming,\" White said afterwards. \"I saw it all game, but I just didn't take it until the end. We never quit until the clock says zero. That's what Coach teaches us all day long.\" When Indian River's Jalen Williams , who pinned two punts inside the 20-yard line earlier in the game including a 57-yarder to tilt field position, booted the ball to White along the sideline, Tigers Head Coach Rich Morgan knew his team had a chance. \"Well, if we were going to score, he's the fastest guy on the field on both sides and he was fresh,\" Morgan pointed out. \"We practice these situations. They come up once in a lifetime and today was once in a lifetime. He got it and he scored.\" A successful extra point by senior kicker Cameron Luster gave the Tigers the lead following White's touchdown. Brandon Delbridge 's interception shortly thereafter completed the comeback, one that football fans in Hampton Roads won't soon forget. The rivalry showdown that has been anticipated long since the summer delivered a memorable finish that met all the hype. Oscar Smith's Southeastern District winning streak is now 79 games as the Tigers moved to 5-0 overall. \"It was a great game. I was proud to be a part of it,\" Morgan continued. \"They've got a really, really good team. They've got an excellent shot to win the Division 5 region and state [titles]. And we've got an awesome chance to win the Division 6 region and state [titles]. Let's end all the Oscar Smith-Indian River talk. Can we just celebrate the fact that two teams went at it, had a great game, somebody had to come out on top and someone's season is not going to die today?\" Indian River, which was looking to secure its first victory over Oscar Smith since 1998, took the lead with 2:35 to go in the second quarter on Tyain Smith 's 39-yard touchdown. They went to half-time with a 7-2 lead. In fact, the Braves remarkably Oscar Smith without a touchdown for over three quarters of play. Their lead was extended to 14-2 on a 40-yard touchdown pass from Tyre Givers-Wilson to Kyren Best on third-and-6 with 2:12 remaining in the third period. Team Scoring Play (Oscar Smith vs. Indian River at Hickory) Game Score Jahmeek Jones blocked punt, Safety 2-0 Smith 39-yard run, PAT Dafoe good 7-2 Givers-Wilson 40-yard pass to Best, PAT Dafoe good 14-2 Hussey 4-yard pass to Mitchell, 2-point pass failed 14-8 White 59-yard punt return, PAT Luster good 15-14 While the Indian River defense held Oscar Smith to a season-low 44 yards rushing and stopped the Tigers twice on fourth down, they were unable to put the game away due to some costly mistakes. Twice, the Braves had would-be touchdowns called back on penalties. The first came on junior safety Devon Hunter 's interception midway through the second quarter. Senior Tavante Beckett , a Virginia Tech commit that transferred to the Braves from Oscar Smith in the off-season, hauled in what would've been a 55-yard touchdown pass to increase the lead to 20-2 with 5:56 remaining when an ineligible man downfield call brought it back. Moments after the second touchdown was called back on a penalty, a bad snap on a punt attempt for Indian River gave the Tigers the ball on the 16-yard line of the Braves with 4:56 remaining when the wheels were put in motion for the rally. \"It's a special win,\" White commented. \"They've been talking for nine months. We just had to find a way to get it done.\" When the game concluded, Morgan was visibly emotional, way more than usual after a win, something he's now done 156 times in 175 tries at Oscar Smith. He even sprinted on to the field in celebration with his team. \"I ran a 4.5 in college. I think I'm back to that today . . . in boots,\" Morgan joked. \"I'm just happy for the kids because they've worked so hard and needed a game like this to validate that, 'hey, you guys are good.' I don't care how young you are or how many kids transferred. None of that matters. You're still a good team. I think today gave them the confidence that now they can move forward.\" Gadget Works: Junior quarterback Shon Mitchell of Oscar Smith has thrown plenty of touchdowns, 78 to be exact, in his Tigers career. Until Saturday, he had never caught one. With Mitchell having been picked off twice, once each by Hunter and Isaiah Hyman , and the offense struggling to run the ball - finishing with 44 yards on 26 attempts - the offense needed to figure out a way to get in the end zone. \"In the first half, I thought he was holding the ball too long and wasn't throwing to receivers [or] making the reads. We talked about it at half-time,\" Morgan said. \"We focused on the short passing game in the second half. That helped him get a rhythm. He had some drops [and] that set us back. In the end, it comes down to who's going to execute at the very end, and we did.\" Faced with a third-and-goal from the Indian River four-yard line and time not on the Tigers' side, they pulled a play out of the trick bag with tailback Kourtney Johnson receiving the direct snap, then handing it off to sophomore receiver Shy'Keem Hussey on a reverse. Hussey then managed to find Mitchell in the end zone for a touchdown pass, which proved to be their only offensive touchdown of the day. \"We've been working on that play since the summer time. We said we're going to use that one time all year. \"It didn't win the game, but it certainly put us in position to. They were tough in the middle. We couldn't run our power set to get it in there. Making Special Teams Special: Besides White's game-altering score in the closing seconds, the Tigers got a key play early in the contest when junior Jahmeek Jones blocked a punt that rolled out of the end zone for a safety. ookending the game's scoring with two critical special teams plays certainly proved pivotal, perhaps more than usual given the narrow final margin. \"We practice special teams more than anybody in the state I think. We're at it all the time,\" noted Morgan. \"It paid off today because offense sputtered, defense was great and gave us some big plays.But special teams I think won the game for us.\" Beckett, who has earned a reputation of being one of the premier special teams performers in the state going back to when he played at Oscar Smith a year ago, came close on a couple of occasions to blocking a punt. Defense Holds the Fort Down: Speaking of Beckett, he made a momentum-changing play for his new team at the end of the first quarter, stopping Johnson on fourth-and-goal for a loss of a yard.Neither offense A lot of that was because of the hard-hitting and physical nature of the game from both sides. Oscar Smith's defense, less ballyhooed in terms of name recognition coming in, performed at a high level, even minus star prospects. Junior linebacker Dekireon Turner had a game-high 10 total tackles with a pair of sacks. Jones was in on seven tackles. Wilfred Long made his presence felt early in the contest by registering three tackles for loss, two on sacks. \"They were lock down. There wasn't one kid that played bad,\" stated Morgan of his defense. \"We had two breakdowns. We ran into a blitz and we didn't cover on a post route. So I was happy with them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:13:37.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
