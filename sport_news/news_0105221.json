No other division could say the same, nor boast anywhere near the same kind of top-to-bottom talent that resides in the toughest group within the toughest conference. Whichever team best survives it (and the four regular season matchups against every other Southwest Division team) will be battle tested in their own way and ready for whatever the postseason brings.\nThe best team in the league could easily be among them and the NBA's best player, too, might come from within this division. For Houston, San Antonio, and Memphis, those season-long prospects could yield a chance at a title. All are well worthy—stacked with proven talent employed in smart ways by veteran coaches. New Orleans and Dallas are competing on a different scale, though the former is stepping forward and the latter, when healthy, is capable enough to dig in and lock up a playoff spot. There are no pushovers. There are no schedule wins. To win the Southwest Division means something, no matter the structural irrelevance of divisions, on the grounds of competition alone. Let the battle royal commence.\n• More Division previews: Atlantic | Central | Northwest | Southeast 1. Houston Rockets\n2014–15 results: 56–26 | Lost in conference finals\nHouston is a team of luxury. The presence of James Harden alone denotes great fortune; only a few teams could claim to have a player so impactful, much less one who takes well to dominating the ball and playing off of it. Of those teams lucky enough to have a superstar, even fewer boast a power-finishing, rim-protecting, bulk-rebounding big of Dwight Howard 's caliber. And then, from that very select group, none at all could match Houston's depth. While some teams scrap for one point guard worthy to start, the Rockets have two. Their wings are stocked with complementary talent ideal for the way Houston wants to play. Behind Howard, too, is all kinds of insurance against injury: A quality post threat in Donatas Motiejunas and an energetic, rotation-ready roll man in Clint Capela .\nThe rest of the roster is populated by athletes who do more than play into Houston's preferred style—they feed it. Corey Brewer and K.J. McDaniels make the kinds of transition-triggering defensive plays that will get the Rockets out on the break. Trevor Ariza denies an opponent its best option and nudges them toward desperation—the kind which can be seized upon with a forced turnover or rushed shot. All of the pieces seem to fit together just so in a way that appears quite formidable, assuming all involved are willing to play their part in making this the best Rockets team possible.\nBest case: Houston runs even the best teams in the West ragged, wearing them down with their relentless energy. A Finals berth (or more) could be in the cards.\nWorst case: Lawson doesn’t get a handle on a very real, very concerning problem. The ripples disrupt the Rockets from within, compromising the structural unity that acts as the team’s strength.\nPhoto: Christian Petersen/Getty Images • MORE NBA: Open Floor: The next step in James Harden's career 2. San Antonio Spurs 2014–15 results: 55–27 | Lost in conference quarterfinals\nThe Spurs sacrificed to clear the space necessary to sign LaMarcus Aldridge , as one does when bracing for the possibility of adding an All-NBA-caliber big man outright. That in itself will force San Antonio to adapt. Gone are Tiago Splitter and Cory Joseph , both integral to Spurs teams past. In their place are the likes of Aldridge and David West —neither an outright replacement but both very useful to the Spurs in their own distinct way. Gregg Popovich will again need to adapt his designs, just as he's done through the last several iterations of Spurs basketball.\nIt helps to have so many balanced, effective weapons at his disposal. The best player on the roster might be Kawhi Leonard , though on the right night some would stump for Aldridge or even 39-year-old Tim Duncan . Danny Green plays off of Leonard perfectly as a lockdown collaborator and ace shooter—together forming one of the most potent wing combinations in the league. Popovich has this and more with which to build lineups and tailor strategies. Once all involved are acclimated to the necessary adjustments, the rest of the league will be faced with a loaded, intelligent team capable of making full use of its terrifying resources.\nBest case: San Antonio assimilates its new pieces without issue, finds way to compensate for its losses, and executes to precision.\nWorst case: Deviation from their previous model leaves the Spurs lacking—and vulnerable—in certain key areas. A run through the Western Conference playoffs exposes them.\n3. Memphis Grizzlies 2014–15 record: 55–27 | Lost in conference semifinals\nThe Grizzlies, as usual, are the quietest of the West's championship contenders. They made no Aldridge-like addition, opting instead for the more moderate improvements of Brandan Wright and Matt Barnes . They don't make the fuss that teams like the Clippers and Warriors are prone to, preferring to focus on their own game. The result is a sturdy, impressive case for title contention—the kind that could overcome the challenge of higher-seeded teams over the course of a playoff run.\nNBA 2015–16 NBA entertainment rankings by Ben Golliver", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/RobMahoney"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:20:28.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
