Sent into bat, Maharashtra lost Swapnil Gugale (2) with only three runs on the board in the fourth over to Suryakant Pradhan, who ended with 2 for 65 in 21 overs. \n\nSkipper Rohit Motwani was out for 22 off 45 balls, having hit five boundaries. The experienced Kedar Jadhav (2), who has an ODI hundred to his name, was the next to go as the visitors slumped to 62 for three. \n\nA 91-run for the fourth wicket between Khadiwale and Bawne revived Maharashtra, but both of them fell after doing all the hard work. While Khadiwale hit 10 fours in his 164-ball knock, Bawne found the fence seven times while facing 146 deliveries.
