We’re always racing against the clock,” she said. “Last race, eight girls had personal bests and were pumped for lowering their times but – even though the regular season is finished – we’re still not where we want to be.” \nThe Green Sea Floyds girls team ended the regular season with a 23-11 record, while the Trojans’ boys team – which was outlasted by Marion in the five-team meet Thursday against Latta – finished at 18-17. \n“I just want them to enjoy running,” Elvington said. “We’re gonna do our best for the region meet and come into the Lower State [meet] strong.” \nGirls \nTeam scores: Green Sea Floyds 15, Marion 69, Loris 87, Latta inc., Hannah-Pamplico inc. \nTop 5: 1.

These are two even teams.” \nThe scores reflected that. Both matches came down to one set each. \n“It was intense,” Kienast said. \nThe Trojans still have one match to go, and it very well may come down to a tiebreaker between Green Sea Floyds and East Clarendon for the Region VIII-A title. \n“We talked about that after the match. We have one left, they have one left. One of us will get it and we just have to take care of our match, not worry about theirs and see how things fall. We need to worry about what we can control.” \n▪ Singles: Kaylee Jordan (GSF) d. Heather Knowltin 6-4, 6-1; Courtnee Faulk (GSF) d. Ashlee Lineberger 3-6, 6-4 (10-7); Lauren Bingham (EC) d.
