Guns will be gathering at shoots across the South West like this one, in South... Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance 1 \nPheasant shooting is important to the South West economically, socially and environmentally. Tim Bonner chief executive of the Countryside Alliance sets out why, as the season begins. \nToday marks an important day in the calendar of the Westcountry – the start of the game shooting season proper. From first light this morning until 1 February groups of “guns” will be out at the thousands of shoots across the county, hoping to bag themselves pheasant, as well as other game that is already in season. \nThere are many reasons why people shoot, among them is the benefit of getting out into the countryside with friends and family and spending a day in the outdoors. \nIn the South West it is estimated that there are 10,000 providers of shooting in the region – from casual DIY shoots to bigger affairs – that attract big money to the county. Related content Country sports fans' big day out falls victim to a changing world \nGiven the large number of places to shoot it is not surprising that shooting is of significant economic importance to the region. If you include all the people who shoot clay pigeons, live quarry and targets, around 170,000 shoot in the South West alone, and their sport ploughs some £250m into the local economy. Then there are the considerable economic benefits to hotels, pubs and restaurants where guns and their partners stay and eat, the specialist shops and outfitters where they buy their equipment, not to mention those employed by the industry as beaters, loaders, gamekeepers and other staff. And as some of the areas where shooting takes place are wilder landscapes where there is little farming, the shoots are often the major economic driver. \nShoots are also of considerable importance to conservation. Across the UK, shoot providers are making improvements like sowing headlands and grass strips around fields, creating and maintaining hedgerows, planting cover crops, thinning and coppicing woodland, creating ponds, maintaining rivers and streams, controlling bracken – the activities go on and on. This work has shaped the countryside which draws the hundreds of millions of visitors to the region each year. \nMany vulnerable species thrive on land maintained for shooting. Predators such as foxes, rats and crows prey on both songbirds and game birds, stealing their eggs and killing their young. But on land where wildlife management is undertaken, bird numbers increase. Research shows an average threefold increase in the breeding success of lapwing, curlew, golden plover, red grouse and meadow pipit when predator control takes place. \nIn Britain we are blessed with some of the greatest conservation organisations in the world, like the Wildlife Trusts, National Trust and RSPB, who all do important work. In addition shooting is involved in the management of some 14 million hectares – which is about two thirds of the rural land mass of the UK. Within that area, nearly two million hectares are actively managed for conservation, such as the planting of trees and hedgerows. That represents 12% of the UK’s rural land, and more than 10 times the total area of all national and local nature reserves. Some £250 million, and the equivalent of 16,000 full time jobs, are spent by shoots on that conservation each year. \nIt is because of shooting that vast amounts of our heritage are being preserved and, to quote RSPB conservation director Martin Harper, “the contribution progressive shoots can make to supporting threatened wildlife is significant”. \nAnother reason to be cheerful about shooting is that eating game makes you happy! Pheasant, partridge and venison all contain high levels of the trace element selenium, which has been proven to improve your mood. There are also other real health benefits to eating game. Pheasant and partridge contain a high level of iron, protein and vitamin B(6) and venison is high in protein, low in saturated fatty acids and contains higher levels of iron than any other red meat. In the aftermath of the horsemeat scandal, people increasingly want to know where their meat comes from, and game is a perfect example of traceable meat. The fact it is also a wild, free-range alternative to farmed meat, just adds to its attraction, and its popularity just keeps increasing. Figures from last year showed that sales of rabbit were up 20% in a year at Marks & Spencer, pheasant sales increased by 30%, while partridge sales jumped by 234%. Waitrose said that its venison sales were up by 92% year-on-year. \nSo whether you enjoy crisp, winter days out in the field, with your dog and friends, young and old, or if you want to once again enjoy fresh free-range game at its best, be thankful that the shooting season is here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:25:06.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
