Sena workers stormed BCCI chief Shashank Manohar’s office carrying placards with slogans like ‘Shahryar Khan Go Back’ and ‘Shashank Manohar Murdabad’. Waving black and saffron flags, they confronted Manohar and demanded that the BCCI snapped all ties with the PCB. After the protest, the talks on the proposed bilateral series have been rescheduled for tomorrow in New Delhi. The BCCI chief, however, was safely escorted out of the building by policemen. The attack sparked condemnation with Sena’s ally BJP saying there is no place for “hooliganism” while the Congress called it \"abominable”. The police arrested 17 Shiv Sena workers on charges of unlawful assembly and violating Police Commissioner's order to refrain from such gathering, a senior police officer said. They, however, were later granted bail by a local court on a personal bond of Rs 2,000. The Shiv Sena justified the storming of the BCCI office. “I am proud of what the Shiv Sainiks did. This was what Balasaheb would have wanted. They (Pakistanis) are killing our jawans. And these people want to talk cricket with the Pakistanis,” said Shiv Sena leader Arvind Sawant said. Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena MP and editor of party mouthpiece Saamna, also came out in support of party workers. “If we have taken law into our hands it is for a good cause. We are reflecting the mood of the nation,” Raut said.
