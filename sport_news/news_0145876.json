The two, however, will be together on the power-play. In Saturday night’s final exhibition game, the Ducks had Getzlaf skating with Carl Hagelin and Chris Stewart. That doesn’t sound too bad for owners of Getzlaf who, as we pointed out in our fantasy preview earlier in the week, had 17 points in 11 games when Perry was injured last season. Perry’s fantasy value, however, could be hurt playing with Rickard Rakell and Jiri Sekac. Ryan Kesler keeps Jakub Silfverberg on one wing and likely inherits Patrick Maroon on the other. Now nothing says this experiment is final. If we’ve learned nothing else from following fantasy hockey, it’s that lines are fluid and, we could well see Getzlaf and Perry reunited at some point.— In Dallas, the Stars seem to be doing the opposite, that is loading up their No. 1 line by putting off-season acquisition Patrick Sharp on the RW with Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn. That’s a bit of a shock on two fronts. First, it was thought trading for Sharp from the Blackhawks would finally give Jason Spezza a quality sniper on the second line. Second, most fantasy owners were expecting Valeri Nichushkin to wind up back with Seguin and Benn after missing all but a handful of games last season injured. Those three were dynamite together during Nichushkin’s rookie season the year before. But now it looks as if Spezza will be skating between Nichushkin and Ales Hemsky to begin the season. Not bad, but again don’t be surprised if they switch back to Plan A.— Jacob Josefson looks like he will be taking over as the Devils’ No. 1 centre. The talented Swede had just a goal and two assists in three pre-season games, but impressed new coach John Hynes with his competitiveness and, more importantly, his ability to maintain that every day. There’s not a lot of scoring punch around Josefson so expectations should be tempered, but he looks like a nice flyer in the final rounds.— The Blackhawks’ demotion of Marko Dano this week was something of a shock. The young winger, who was seen as the key to the off-season trade that sent Brandon Saad to Columbus, appeared ticketed to skate alongside Jonathan Toews and Marian Hossa on the top line. But now it seems fourth-year winger Andrew Shaw, who had 26 points last season, will occupy that spot. The second line is more intriguing, however. A week ago, there were any number of possible combinations being floated around for potential Patrick Kane linemates. But if Saturday’s final exhibition tilt was any indication, it will be veteran Artem Anisimov (another ex-Jacket involved in the Saad trade) and rookie Artemy Panarin, who signed as a free agent after torching the KHL for 62 points in 54 games. That leaves the highly skilled Teuvo Teravainen, who enjoyed his coming-out party during the Hawks’ Stanley Cup run this past spring, as third-line centre, though we figure that, once he gets re-acclimatized to the position after spending much of last season on the wing, will eventually replace Anisimov, whose skill-set is more in line with a third-line forward.— Brayden Schenn looks like he’s been bumped out of the top six on the Flyers. Skill-wise, the fifth overall pick in 2009 should be either the second-line centre or first-line LW with Claude Giroux and Jakub Voracek, both of which he has done in the past. But new coach Dave Hakstol is not enamoured with the defensive game of Schenn who, at times during camp, was regarded, per Flyers blogger Bill Meltzer, as a “fifth-liner.” Although injuries prevented Hakstol from cementing his forward lines, it looks like R.J. Umberger, who appears to be his old 20-goal self following hip surgery, will play with Giroux and Voracek while Couturier returns as second-line centre between Wayne Simmonds and Michael Raffl. — Lightning’s Jonathan Drouin has looked great on the wing with Steven Stamkos and appears ready to make his big leap following his worrisome four-goal rookie season. — The could be a changing of the offensive guard in Minnesota this season, where it is expected that veteran forwards such as Thomas Vanek, Mikko Koivu and Jason Pominville will be handing the proverbial torch over to the likes of Jason Zucker, Charlie Coyle, Mikael Granlund and Nino Niederreiter in terms of ice time and on-ice expectations. The line of Coyle, Zucker and Niederreiter has been dominant in the pre-season.— Think the new Maple Leafs coaches want to get an early handle on what Jake Gardiner is all about? According to CBSSports' statistics, the enigmatic young defenceman leads all NHL skaters with 143 minutes of total ice time during the pre-season. — The top of the 2015 draft class is meeting its expectations early on with four of the top five picks all expected to open the season in the NHL. Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel were no-brainers to crack their teams’ opening-night lineups, will likely be the No. 1 centres on the Oilers and Sabres, respectively, and be instant fantasy producers. Third pick Dylan Strome, by all accounts, is the most skilled of the Coyotes forwards in camp and appears to have made third-line centre with greybeard Shane Doan on his wing, while No. 5 Noah Hanifin has not looked out of place as a third-pairing defenceman on the Hurricanes. Mitch Marner, taken fourth overall by the Maple Leafs, as expected already is back in junior.
