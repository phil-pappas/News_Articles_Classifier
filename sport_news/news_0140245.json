The Mustangs are averaging 45.6 points per game and have yet to score fewer than 33 in any contest so far this year. The defending Class 2AA state champions have extended their winning streak to 21 games dating back to the beginning of 2014. So as a coach, when the sailing has been so smooth, the natural concern would be complacency setting in, of a team losing its edge. Mustangs coach Mike Byus isn’t so much concerned about that possibility, he’s just hoping when it comes, his team can fight through it. “It’s just going to happen. it doesn’t matter how many times you warn the kids about it you just hope they get in the game and if they’re not playing with full intensity they wake up in time to do something about it,” Byus said. This East Lincoln group is pretty laid back, Byus said, but so far that’s masked a willingness to work to keep this winning streak rolling. Eventually, the streak will come to an end, and Byus said he’s prepared for the possibility. “Hopefully we’ll play well this Friday and some other Fridays to come. There will be a Friday we don’t and the world won’t come to an end. It will keep spinning and their mommas will still love them in the morning,” said the Mustangs coach. East Lincoln hopes this Friday is not the one the run ends. The Mustangs will travel to rival Lincolnton, where the Wolves will hope to pick up a win after dropping two losses to East Lincoln last year – one in the regular season and one in the playoffs. Lincolnton coach Ledford Gibson, in his first year as head coach with the Wolves after spending 15 seasons as assistant, said his team was sunk in past meetings because they let a bad play or a controversial call into their heads and lost focus. Earlier this season against East Gaston, the Wolves trailed big in the first half, down 26-7. They came back to win that game, and Gibson hopes the battle through adversity is a sign that the team won’t let a poor start or poor play take them spiraling out of control. “That was good, because between me and the seniors getting in there getting after them, getting on them pretty good, they stepped it up and came back out there and played,” Gibson said. “Hopefully something like that showed them that they can step up and play through bad things, it was a learning experience for them.” East Lincoln senior quarterback Chazz Surratt comes into the game with 1,387 passing yards and 21 touchdowns already this season as he approaches the 9,000 yard mark for his career. Gibson said the Lincolnton defense’s task starts with stopping No. 12, but that’s easier said than done against the University of North Carolina commit. “In 25 years I’ve been coaching he’s as good as I’ve seen,” Gibson said. The Wolves have found a promising young quarterback themselves in Cordel Littlejohn. The sophomore has completed 58 percent of his passes this year, and gives the team some balance to go with their bull at running back, Tarus Dameron (81 carries, 616 yards). Gibson said Littlejohn’s response to the pressure of the big game may dictate the result. “How he’s able to adjust to this game, the atmosphere of this game - if he can do that well and make them have to spread out defensively and that will give Tarus some lanes to run in and free Jordon (Easter) into spots that will open up some things for us,” Gibson said. Whether it’s this week or not, Byus knows at some point his team will be involved in a close game and won’t get a bounce. He just hopes they have it in them to respond. “You’ve got to be ready for when you’re going to face that bear in the woods. We’re going to play on given weeks where people are just better than you are, whether it be individually at certain positions or as an entire team. That’s why you keep practicing and keep training, you want to be as mentally and physically ready as possible to play a game,” Byus said. “When that time comes, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes he gets you.” Sometimes the bear gets you, but East Lincoln hopes the Wolves don’t get them this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:14:30.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
