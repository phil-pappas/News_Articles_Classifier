A win next week against Waldwick/Midland Park would give Rutherford the league title outright.\nIt has been a long couple of years for the Bulldogs’ football program. They were 3-7 in 2014 and 2-7 in 2013. \n\"The past two seasons weren’t at all fun,\" Foley said. \"[Quarterback] Nick [Birchby] was hurt, we had a few more injuries, but we stepped up this year. It was frustrating, but we are all family and we knew that if we stuck together, we would win games.\"\n\"Our coaches and our players are just so excited to be playing in meaningful games,\" Rutherford coach Andrew Howell said. \"I think we have brought a lot of pride back to the Rutherford community.\"\nA healthy Birchby gives the Bulldogs a strong-armed quarterback and good athlete under center. He also has a bevy of talented weapons around him, including running back Kevin Kosakowski, who rushed for two touchdowns in the first half. \nSophomore running back Billy Finn also scored a touchdown, and junior receiver Tom Reid had a clutch fourth-down catch in the second quarter.\n\"We have a lot of athletes,\" Howell said. \"It’s great. This team doesn’t really rely on one player, we really do rely on every single one of these kids to make us click.\"\nGarfield (5-2) has loads of offensive talent as well, led by quarterback Alex Victorino and running back Aveon Irving, but the Rutherford defense, despite being outweighed up front, kept the pair bottled up much of the night.\n\"We wanted to fire off the ball and stay low,\" said Joe Mauro, Rutherford senior defensive lineman. \"Coach preaches it all the time, and I work on it in practice. We knew we had to keep those guys inside and make the tackle.\"\n\"We had to play low, it’s a game of leverage. I thought the key to our success today we just executing the fundamentals,\" Howell said. \"Swarming to the ball and getting the ball carrier down in open space.\"\nRutherford opened the scoring on its second possession, marching 55 yards in 11 plays, helped by a pass interference penalty on the Boilermakers. Kosakowski scored on 5-yard run.\nThe key drive may have been just before halftime. A good Garfield punt pushed Birchby and the Bulldogs back to their own 15 with 2:02 left, but Birchby hit Reid on a 14-yard crossing pattern and found Kosakowski on a deep pass down to the Boilermakers’ 35.\nReid made a great catch near the sideline on fourth-and-9 at the Garfield 16, and on the next play, Kosakowski rumbled in to make it 14-0.\nWith every touchdown, the fire trucks in the end zone would blare their sirens. It was a great thing to hear for Rutherford.\n\"I think it’s been two years since we have seen those fire trucks here,\" Howell said.\nGarfield scored a late touchdown to avoid the shutout.\n\"We knew their offense was explosive,\" Foley said. \"We knew we had to make open-field tackles and not allow their big plays which I think we did really well. We trusted our defensive line and our men in the box to handle the inside run game and our secondary stepped up big time.\"\nThe Bulldogs entered Friday sitting in fourth place in the North 2, Group 2 standings. Garfield, a Group 3 school, will give them a significant boost in the power points.\nHowell said he’d love a home playoff game because he feels like the atmosphere around his team is fantastic. The Bulldogs do seem to have ingredients that make up a championship team — talent and determination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:22.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
