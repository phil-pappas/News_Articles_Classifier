Gonzalez, AP) 3 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWhen : 7:30 p.m. today \nLine : OSU by 2 1/2 \nTV : PAC-12 Networks \nFour-Down Territory \nFAST START \nIn the Beavers' last two games - losses at Arizona and Washington State - they were out of the game at halftime. A better start is essential for OSU's chances. \nPAC-12 FUTILITY \nColorado is 4-35 in conference games since joining the Pac-12 in 2011 with 14 consecutive losses in conference play. The Buffaloes blew a fourth-quarter lead last week against Arizona, but the time could be right for a breakthrough. Nick Mitchell moves into backup QB role \nWHERE'S VILLAMIN? \nWide receiver Jordan Villamin is the Beavers' best deep threat, but he has been a non-factor the past two games with five catches for just 36 yards and one TD. OSU needs to incorporate him more in the offense. \nBRING THE HEAT \nThe Beavers have struggled to find a consistent pass rush this season and their eight sacks ranks last in the Pac-12. OSU needs to make quarterback SefoLiufau uncomfortable in the pocket. \nKey Matchup \nOSU CB DWAYNE WILLIAMS VS. COLORADO WR NELSON SPRUCE \nWilliams will be making his second career start and he has a difficult assignment against Nelson Spruce, the Buffaloes' leading receiver. \nWho has the edge? \nRushing offense \nSeth Collins is fourth nationally in rushing among QBs, but the Buffaloes have more balance in their running game. Edge : Colorado \nPassing offense \nSefoLiufau has thrown for 1,730 yards and eight TDs. OSU is last in the Pac-12 in passing. Edge : Colorado \nRushing defense \nNeither team excels in this area. By comparison, OSU gave up 368 yards rushing to Arizona and Colorado allowed 291. Edge : Even \nPassing defense \nThe Beavers are giving up 216.2 ypg through the air, and the Buffs are close behind at 219.3. Edge : Even \nSpecial teams \nVictor Bolden had a 100-yard kickoff return for a TD against WSU. Edge : OSU \nInjuries \nBoth teams will be missing key players. CB Larry Scott (ankle) is out for the Beavers, and WR Shay Fields is not expected to play for Colorado. Edge : Even \nCoaching \nColorado is 1-20 in Pac-12 games under Mike MacIntyre. OSU coach Gary Andersen had success at Utah State and Wisconsin. Edge : OSU \nIntangibles \nIt's homecoming at Reser Stadium. Bummer that it's another night game for the Beavers. Edge : OSU \nThe bottom line \nIn an evenly matched game between Pac-12 bottom feeders, give OSU a slight edge playing at home.
