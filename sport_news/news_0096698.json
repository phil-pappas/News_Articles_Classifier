Peters immediately crumpled to the ground, where he lay, facedown, while Bradford was sacked by Kawaan Short. \nEventually, Peters rode the cart down the tunnel, after receiving well-wishes from players on both teams. Matt Tobin, who'd seemed to be settling in at right guard, in his fourth start of the season, moved to left tackle. Dennis Kelly took over at right guard, for a team that was already in a mistake-filled 7-0 hole that probably should have been worse. Word from the locker room was a Peters back injury. He did not return; the Eagles announced \"back spasms.\" \nAs was the case Monday night, the Eagles' defense looked horrendous in giving up a first-drive touchdown, 72 yards in four plays. The team that was tied for third in the NFL for stingiest rushing-yards-per-carry was gashed for 36 yards by Jonathan Stewart, then immediately gave up a 25-yard catch to Corey \"Philly\" Brown, which took Carolina to the Eagles' 2. Mike Tolbert ran it in from there. You could feel the absence of DeMeco Ryans, who sat with the hamstring injury he suffered against the Giants. \nBefore that, on the Panthers' first snap of the game, the Eagles thought they had recovered a Stewart fumble, but the officials didn't agree and Kelly did not challenge. \nThe Eagles' offense couldn't get out of its own way early - Lane Johnson false-started on a fine third-down conversion pass to Brent Celek, then Peters was beaten for a Mario Addison sack. After the punt, Carolina was moving again. Ted Ginn Jr. seemed to have made a catch at the Birds' 5, but Nolan Carroll got his hands in and ripped the ball out, eventually. It sure seemed Ginn was down, with possession, but even with benefit of review, that was not the ruling. Interception. \nThen came the drive on which Peters was injured. \nThe Eagles got within 7-3 on a 52-yard Caleb Sturgis field goal, but Sturgis promptly ended any warm feelings by shanking the kickoff out of bounds. Given the ball on their 40, the Panthers drove 60 yards in four plays and took a 14-3 lead on a 2-yard Newton touchdown run. \n\"Drive\" doesn't really describe it. First, 2014 first-round draft pick Marcus Smith got caught inside on an end-around, Ginn rambling 43 yards, to the Eagles' 8. Then Bennie Logan jumped early. Then Bennie Logan jumped again. Then Newton scored. \nThe Eagles got three points back at the end of the half, after a Malcolm Jenkins interception, but they should have had a touchdown. First down from the Carolina 11, it went Darren Sproles drop, Jordan Matthews pushed out of the back of the end zone before he could get both feet down, and Josh Norman flicking a pass away from Zach Ertz. \nThe Eagles, who came in knowing they had to stop the run to win, gave up 118 first-half rushing yards on just 13 carries. \nIt was 21-6 after the first drive of the second half, Carolina going 80 yards in seven plays. The final snap of the drive was particularly galling; Tolbert, the Panthers' fullback, took a swing pass behind the line of scrimmage and should have been hit immediately, but Byron Maxwell seemed to throw up his arms and grab at the air. Tolbert, listed at 5-9, 245, then got his legs moving and flattened Jenkins on his way to the end zone. A couple of other Eagles were bystanders. \nBut a 63-yard Mathews touchdown run got the Eagles back in the game. Mathews didn't carry once between his 22-yard gain, on which the ball was snapped with 6:55 left in the second quarter, and the TD run, with 9:32 left in the third. \nWhen Maxwell dived to pick off a pass batted by Carolina's Devin Funchess, then ran it back to the Panthers' 18, the Eagles seemed to have seized momentum. Then they ran the ensuing series with no sign of Mathews; twice Murray ran for no gain, once he gained a couple. And on third-and-goal, Josh Huff dropped a touchdown pass, so Sturgis made it 21-16 with a 24-yarder. \nStill, after that, the Eagles were driving to take the lead, then they weren't. After a first down at the Panthers' 32, Murray gained a yard, Sproles turned the wrong way on a pass, the Eagles had to call timeout to avoid a delay penalty, then, given time to prepare a play, they went with a pass to Huff on the right side, at the line of scrimmage, that never had any chance whatsoever of gaining 9 yards. \nSturgis then missed a 50-yard field goal, and Carolina drove for a 35-yard Graham Gano field goal that made it 24-16 with 8:59 left. \nAt the end of that drive, Stewart had 104 yards on 17 carries.
