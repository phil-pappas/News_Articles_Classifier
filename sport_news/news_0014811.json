A judge said many had accepted bribes of 1 million vatu ($9,000) to help overthrow the previous government.\nBut the next day, Pipite signed a pardon for himself and the others. Because the president was away, Pipite was the acting head of state.\nHe told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. he signed the pardons out of concern for the nation's interests rather than his own.\n\"I decided to make such orders to maintain the peace, unity, in this country,\" he said.\nBut the move has angered many people in Vanuatu, who had turned out in large numbers to hear the Supreme Court verdicts. Many hoped the verdicts would mark an end to the corruption which has plagued the country's political system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:12:35.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
