Ben Bishop stopped 27 shots. \nIt was Tampa Bay's first win in Boston since March 25, 2010. \nLoui Eriksson had two power-play goals, and David Krejci also had one for Boston, which opened a season with three straight losses for the first time since 1999. \nTuukka Rask made 17 saves for the Bruins. \nBoston captain Zdeno Chara played his first game after missing most of the preseason with an undisclosed upper body injury. \nStamkos fired a slap shot from the top of the right circle for the milestone point that broke a 3-3 tie at 15:17 of the second period. Drouin and Filppula scored in the third. \nBoyle stole the puck from winger David Pastrnak near center ice at the end of a Bruins' power play, broke in alone on Rask and slipped a backhand between his pads, making it 3-2 just under five minutes into the second. \nBoston tied it with its third power-play goal when Krejci's shot from the point caromed into the net off Eriksson. \nTrailing 2-0, the Lightning scored twice in just over a minute late in the opening period. \nBoyle beat Rask with a wrister over his left shoulder at 15:42. \nWith Patrice Bergeron off for goaltender interference, Palat redirected a shot between Rask's pads from the edge of the crease. \nThe Bruins had opened a 2-0 lead midway into the first. \nEighteen seconds after Matthew Carle was whistled for hooking, Krejci one-timed a shot past Bishop. Eriksson banged in Torey Krug's pass from the edge of the crease, making it 2-0 at 11:02. \nNOTES: The Bruins signed former Boston University player Travis Roy to a one-day contract. Twenty-years ago, he suffered a spinal cord injury 11 seconds into his first shift, leaving him a paraplegic. He also dropped the ceremonial first puck, and the team made a $50,000 donation to his foundation. ...
