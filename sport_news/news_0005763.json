In addition to Menasha and Roseburg, shootings occurred at a church in Charleston, S.C.; at military facilities in Chattanooga, Tenn.; at a theater in Lafayette, La.; and at a high school in Marysville, Wash. \nREAD MORE: Fox Cities Trestle Trail Bridge Shooting \nThe entry on the Trestle Trail shooting includes photographs of victims Jonathan Stoffel, 33, and Adam Bentdahl, 31, and it mentions victim Olivia Stoffel, 11. They died on the bridge after being shot at random by Menasha gunman Sergio Valencia del Toro, who then fatally shot himself. \nErin Stoffel — Jonathan's wife and Olivia's mother — also was shot by Valencia del Toro. She survived. \nToxicology results revealed Valencia del Toro's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 percent — three times the legal limit for driving — when he opened fire on the bridge. \nPolice said Valencia del Toro had suicidal and homicidal ideas dating to 2010, according to behavioral health records obtained by the FBI. \nDuke Behnke: 920-993-7176, or dbehnke@postcrescent.com; on Twitter @DukeBehnke 1 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://post.cr/1RUE3Mo TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:23:38.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
