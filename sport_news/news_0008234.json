Villaruel   10, 2015 - 12:00am \nCEBU, Philippines - The Sacred Heart School-Ateneo de Cebu Magis Eagles and the University of Cebu Junior Webmasters will settle their unfinished business once and for all as they clash in the deciding match of their best-of-three juniors division finals in the 15th Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc. men’s basketball tournament today at the Cebu Coliseum. \nGametime is set at 3 p.m., with the Magis seeking back-to-back championships and the Junior Webmasters hoping to end a seven-year title drought. \nGauging from their past two encounters, hoop fans are expected to witness another exciting showdown between the heavily favored defending champions and their underdog challengers, but with a reputation of a giant-slayer. \nAfter prevailing over the University of the Visayas Baby Lancers and the University of San Carlos Baby Warriors that propelled them to an unexpected finals appearance, the Junior Webmasters continued their fairytale run by stunning the previously undefeated Magis Eagles to the tune of 73-63 in the opener of their race-to-2 duel. \nWith their invincibility shaken after a rousing 11-0 streak, the Magis Eagles lived and fight for another day after whipping back at the Junior Webmasters, 63-53, in Game 2 last Thursday, thanks to a brilliant performance of Eroll Pastor. \nPastor gamely stepped on the scoring plate, tossing in 11 of his topscoring 23 points in the final quarter that dealt heavy damage on the gritty Junior Webmasters. Freeman ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: \nThough his presence is intimidating, SHS-Ateneo’s star player Jed Colonia has yet to show his true element in the finals and that is something that the Junior Webmasters should be wary of. \nAside from Colonia and Pastor, the Magis Eagles of coach Rommel Rasmo could also count on Travis Mantua, Patrick Yu, Justin Javelosa, Wayne Bersaluna, Phil Calumpang and John Emmanuel Chen among others as they try to retain the crown they snared in 2013. \nThe Junior Webmasters, on the other hand, will squeeze the most from their trusted triumvirate of Froilan Mangubat, Jason Abejo and Luigi Gabisan. \nThe other aces coach Jover Samonte could lay down are John Bryl Cuyos and their small, but terrible playmaker Gemart Umpad as they hope to win their first title since 2008.
