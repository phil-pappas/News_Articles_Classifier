Peavy caught four of six passes for 44 yards in UW's 23-21 victory over Nebraska. \nThree of the catches resulted in first downs, with two coming on third down. He drew a pass-interference penalty for another first down (on a third-and-11 play) and saw a 14-yard reception on third and 9 wiped out by offensive interference. \nThe flight home from Lincoln, Neb., was satisfying. \n\"It was an exciting flight for sure,\" Peavy said, smiling. \"Back in high school was the last time I felt like was making plays and being a big part of keeping the offense rolling.\" \nPeavy had critical catches on three of UW's five scoring drives against the Cornhuskers. \nWith the game scoreless and UW facing third and 15, Peavy beat his man to the sideline and went low to make the catch for a 16-yard gain to the Nebraska 14. Several plays later, on second and goal from the 14, Peavy gained 7 yards. That led to Stave's 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Troy Fumagalli. \nWith UW trailing, 14-10, and facing third and 11 in the third quarter, Peavy drew an interference penalty. That gave UW a first down at the Nebraska 30. Five plays later, Peavy converted a third and 5 with a 9-yard reception to the Nebraska 1. He caught the ball at the 6 and eluded the first defender before being stopped short of the goal line. One play later, freshman tailback Alec Ingold scored to give UW the lead. \nPeavy's final catch was a 12-yard gain to the UW 49. Stave hit Fumagalli for 23 yards on the next play to move UW into position for Rafael Gaglianone's game-winning field goal. \n\"He has really come along,\" fellow wide receiver Alex Erickson said. \"He worked hard this summer. We're glad he is out there with us because he is definitely a playmaker for us. You see him continue to grow every week.... \n\"It is important to have another weapon out there, especially on third downs. And that is when he is out there a lot. It is important for him to make plays like that, just trust himself and play fast.\" \nErickson earned Stave's trust last season and sees Peavy doing the same this season. \n\"It starts in practice and in summer conditioning,\" Erickson said. \"But the game is when it counts and that is when you really start to build that trust. It is one of those things that has to come naturally. \n\"Their relationship has definitely grown. You can see it in his production...the big catches he is making on third downs, picking up first downs. If he continues to grow like that, it is only going to help us.\" \nPeavy has 10 catches through six games, the No. 3 mark among the wide receivers. Erickson leads the way with 33 and junior Robert Wheelwright, also experiencing a breakout season, has 19. \nPeavy's breakthrough came in the spring when avoided injury and showed the staff he could make plays. \n\"That is when I really started getting the ball rolling,\" he said. \"And the first game I started realizing I was going to be in the game and the ball would be thrown to me.\" \nHis ability to convert third-down chances in the victory over Nebraska was critical because UW was just 5 of 16 overall. That included 4 of 13 chances on pass plays. \n\"I definitely feel comfortable when it's third down,\" Peavy said. \"I know some type of play is coming up where we've got to get past that third-down marker and keep the chains moving. \n\"So I know I've got to do whatever I can to make a play on the ball.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
