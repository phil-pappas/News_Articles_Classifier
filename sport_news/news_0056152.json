Interim coach Bill Cubit had said earlier this week that he doubted Ferguson would play. Ferguson injured the shoulder early in Illinois' 14-13 victory over Nebraska and did not return. The senior has 397 yards and three touchdowns on 71 carries for the Illini (4-1, 1-0 Big Ten). Freshman Ke'Shawn Vaughn took over for Ferguson on Saturday and was the only other Illini back to carry the ball. Vaughn had 98 yards on 24 carries. Cubit has said Illinois will need junior Henry Enyenihi to help pick up the rushing load at Iowa (5-0, 1-0).
