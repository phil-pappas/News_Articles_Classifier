[sic] \nOn the same day, Cristiano shared a picture of him with Claudia, along with a host of models, writing alongside it: 'It seems the launch of my perfume went very well...!' \nCristiano is newly-single following his split from Russian model Irina Shayk, who's now dating actor Bradley Cooper, earlier this year following a five-year relationship. \nHe has full custody of his five-year-son Cristiano, who was born in the US, never publicly naming the identity of the mother. \nMeanwhile, Ronaldo has been released from the Portugal squad by manager Fernando Santos after helping his team secure their qualification for next summer's Euro 2016 tournament. \nCredit: Daily Mail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:07:35.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
