He admits a younger Jake Coker, the one who lost out to Jameis Winston in Florida State, might have let all that talk bother him. \nAt Alabama, the soft-spoken quarterback shut out the noise and focused solely on what Nick Saban tells him to do. \n\"There's been doubts the whole time,\" Coker said. \"I study the film, do what I'm told to do and we just try to win the game.\" \nHe did all that and more Saturday in Alabama's 38-10 demolition of No. 8 Georgia . He was poised, patient and almost perfect in a must-win game for the Crimson Tide. In the lead up to the game, his Alabama teammates said it was apparent Coker was more confident, more at-ease with being the starter. He got all the first-team reps at quarterbacks the last two weeks and Saturday showed the benefits of Alabama finally putting all its faith in Coker. \nFor the first time since a season-opening win against Wisconsin, the Alabama offense was in rhythm and looked very efficient. It was easily Coker's best performance in a Tide uniform and it came under the most difficult of circumstances. With rain pouring out of the skies, Coker quieted the raucous Bulldogs faithful in Sanford Stadium. He finished the game 11 of 16 for 190 yards, one passing touchdown, one rushing touchdown and no interceptions. \n\"Most people probably don't know how difficult it is to play in circumstances like that, but he managed the game well,\" Saban said. \"He got us into the right plays; he changed the protection a few times; he made a couple of really good throws.\" \nCoker's 45-yard touchdown pass to freshman Calvin Ridley was the throw Alabama fans have been waiting for since his arrival in Tuscaloosa. When Coker transferred to Alabama last summer, he came in with the reputation of having a monster arm following Jimbo Fisher's effusive praise of his time in Tallahassee. The hype had mostly been true -- he could throw the ball very far -- but he hadn't connected on a deep pass until his perfect throw to Ridley. \n\"I've had a little drought on the deep balls lately, so that was pretty nice,\" Coker said. \nThe Alabama quarterback has an aw-shucks kind of personality that serves him well in a hot takes world. His time in Tuscaloosa has been filled with ups and downs, but he's stayed even-keeled through a stretch that could destroy a player's confidence. He lost a quarterback battle to Blake Sims after being hyped as the presumed starter. He entered Year 2 as the heavy favorite to become the starter, but struggled to put away the competition during fall practice and entered the season still locked in a quarterback competition. \nIt wasn't until Coker's late rallying effort against Ole Miss that it was clear he would be the starter going forward though Saban never officially announced it. \nComing into Saturday's game, Georgia quarterback Greyson Lambert was billed as the better player. Critics looked as Coker's uneven past performances as a reason to pick against the Crimson Tide in the big SEC clash. His early season played was used as another indictment on Saban's supposed inability to develop quarterbacks. \nIt was nothing new for Coker. \n\"After awhile, whatever they say is what they're going to say,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter anymore.\" \nAfter Saturday's performance, he's right.
