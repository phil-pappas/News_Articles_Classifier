If they finish in a three-way tie, they would play either Minnesota or Houston or Tuesday.\nMonday would be Richards’ turn, but they may need to use him Sunday to get there, which would leave Heaney as the best option.\nHeaney threw 84 pitches Thursday night, allowing four runs and taking the loss.\nAlthough neither Richards nor Heaney has ever started on three days rest, Scioscia said it’s a possibility.\n“When you are talking about bringing guys back on three days, if you are going to do it three times around the rotation its more of a physical issue,” Scioscia said. “As far as where we are now, it’s more of a mental issue with your routine.”\nIf the Angels use Richards on Sunday and Heaney on Monday, that would leave Jered Weaver , also on three days rest, as their most likely starter for the wild-card game on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.\nScioscia said the Angels have all the contingencies mapped out.\n“This can change six different ways before you get to Sunday,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any more that can happen that we haven’t worked through.”\nALSO\nMatt Shoemaker played catch for the first time in about a week. He said he’s feeling better, but there is no timetable for when he may be able to pitch again. Shoemaker said he’s still holding out hope that if the Angels make the postseason he could pitch sometime. He missed nearly three weeks with forearm tightness, then came back for one start, which he said was probably too soon. He has not thrown off a mound since that Sept. 20 game in Minnesota. ...\nHuston Street , out with a strained groin, is with the team and was expected to do some light throwing this weekend. Scioscia said it's \"nothing close\" to what he would need to do to pitch, though. ...\nJohnny Giavotella has six extra base hits among his first eight hits since coming off the disabled list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:40:04.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
