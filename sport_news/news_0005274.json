Dolphins improve their record to 2-3 and play the Texans next week at Sun Life Stadium. Steve Svekis Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel \nMiami defensive end Olivier Vernon was flagged twice for personal fouls based on him contacting Titans rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota on Sunday during the Dolphins' 38-10 rout of Tennessee. \nThe first penalized play caved the second overall pick's knee. He stayed in the game but was limping. \nTennessee Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt tersely said after the game: \"I think it was B.S. ... I think it was done with the idea of trying to hurt our quarterback, and that's bulls--- football.\" \nFormer Chargers and Patriots standout safety Rodney Harrison, though, absolved the Dolphins defensive end of any ill intent, saying during NBC's Football Night in America telecast that Vernon 'slipped.' \nThe Dolphins entered the Titans game with one sack in the first four games, but piled up six sacks in Nashville, five of them in the second quarter, after the first Vernon hit. \nWhisenhunt's Titans haven't won a home game in more than a year. and he dropped to 3-18 overall there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:45:02.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
