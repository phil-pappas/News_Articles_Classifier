(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (Patrick Semansky) \nPHILADELPHIA -- When Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson crumbled to the ground after a field goal try in the second half of Sunday's loss to the Washington Redskins at FedEx Field , he thought his season was over. \n\"I felt a pop and I guess it was more my knee than my ankle, but I was scared,\" Johnson said following Tuesday's practice at the NovaCare Complex. \"Usually if I'm on the ground ... And punching the ground, I thought I was done, to be honest. Fortunately it wasn't too bad.\" \nJohnson underwent an MRI Monday that revealed a sprained left MCL and sprained left ankle, but the former first round draft choice says he'll play Sunday vs. the New Orleans Saints despite missing Tuesday's practice. \nEAGLES VS.

I'll be alright.\" \nThe Oklahoma product has been wearing a brace on his knee all season that at times looks like it could be limiting his lateral movement and ability to block stunting defenders. However, Johnson credits the brace with saving his season. \n\"If I wouldn't have had my brace on for that field goal, I think I would have blown my knee out,\" Johnson said. \"It was pretty nasty. I think I'm just going to keep on wearing it. It isn't really effecting me, too much. It's keeping my knee intact. \nDespite his competitiveness and desire to be on the field, Johnson admitted that if the Eagles were fully healthy along the offensive line that he would consider taking more time to recover.
