Less than a minute later, Frank Cetrulo scored on a 16-yard run. Just before the half, Donnelly caught a 43-yard touchdown pass from Pfefferman to give the Mustangs a 32-0 lead at the half. \nCetrulo added a 65-yard run in the third quarter. \nTate’s touchdown reception was his team-best ninth of the season for Berea. \nParis (9-0, 4-0) won the Class A, District 5 title and will be a No. 1 seed in the playoffs. Bishop Brossart finishes second, Nicholas County was third and Bracken County finished fourth. \nThe top four teams in each district make the playoffs. \nBerea will wrap up the season next week at Estill County.
