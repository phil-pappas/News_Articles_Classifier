(AP) - Derrick Henry's 14-yard touchdown run with 2:24 left lifted No. 8 Alabama to a 19-14 victory Saturday over Tennessee. Alabama's aggressive defense then recorded two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Joshua Dobbs to preserve the win and the Crimson Tide's national championship hopes. Alabama (7-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) got plenty of help, with Tennessee (3-4, 1-3) missing three long field goal attempts. The Vols took the lead on Jalen Hurd's 12-yard scoring run with 5:49 left. Alabama overwhelmed the 15-point underdogs from there. Quarterback Jake Coker moved Alabama downfield thanks to athletic catches by ArDarius Stewart and Calvin Ridley. Then he turned it over to Henry. Dobbs and Tennessee managed a first down before the sacks. Anderson jarred the ball loose and A'Shawn Robinson recovered on the second one. Alabama has won the last nine meetings, and the Vols have dropped 24 straight against Top 10 teams. ___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:13:07.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
