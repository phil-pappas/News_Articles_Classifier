Joe Rexrode, Detroit Free Press 6:21 p.m. EDT October 16, 2015 Getting right to the point with a look at MSU & U-M fans' psyche entering Saturday's showdown in Ann Arbor The scene of Saturday's showdown (Photo: Getty Images) \nLook, it's been a busy week so this is a little late, inside of 24 hours until the big one in Ann Arbor. And for this very special edition of the Contentment Curve, we will relegate the rest of the Big Ten to single-phrase descriptions. \n(Weekly disclaimer: This is not a power ranking. This is how the Big Ten teams and their fans are feeling at the moment). \n1. Michigan . Things are so great, right? So, so great. So exciting. So beautiful. The Harbaugh machine is rolling. The defense has three straight shutouts. The offense is mashing. Las Vegas is talking national championship, and the line just keeps growing for this game. It's all happening. Sparty is going to eat it. And then we're coming for you, Ohio (oh wait, we don't say that anymore). We're coming for you, Urban, after this countdown clock reads zero and we can take out some frustration on Mike D'Antoni and Spartan Bob and that stupid ref who missed Desmond being tackled and whoever else wronged us for all those other illegitimate State wins (oh wait, we don't have a countdown clock anymore). After we kill Sparty, Harbs will get all the recruits and Sparty can go back to scrapping with Iowa for the Outback Bowl and we'll start collecting nattys. Man, but can you imagine if Sparty somehow pulls off this upset of the century? What if our defense got fat on crappy offenses with young quarterbacks? What if all the mistakes we haven't been making come at once? What if Jake Rudock isn't up to this? What if Connor Cook and that defensive line are too much? What if I have to hear from my annoying freaking cousin Nick for another freaking year about this stuff? I can't lose to them again. I can't watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:52:06.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
