I don't think there was any one particular turning point. I just kept on hitting the ball and making putts. This is absolutely incredible.\"\nYang, twice a winner on the LPGA Tour, looked to have blown her chance of creating history when a wayward chip left her 15 feet past the hole on the par-five 18th but she was soon staring at the heavens in disbelief after her final putt found the cup.\nThe Korean admitted she was not really conscious of her streak until playing partner Jessica Korda reminded her at the 17th hole.\n\"She said, 'You should go for another birdie and finish with nine straight,'\" Yang said.\n\"And I was really nervous about that last birdie putt at the 18th. It wasn't for the championship but it just felt like it. I never thought about making history but it's an honor to be in the record books.\"\n(Writing by John O'Brien in Singapore; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:59:19.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
