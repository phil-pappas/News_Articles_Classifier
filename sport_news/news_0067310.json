North Carolina State won 35-17. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton) × \nWho : No. 3 Clemson (7-0, 4-0 ACC) at N.C. State (5-2, 1-2) \nWhen : Oct. 31, 3:30 p.m. \nWhere : Carter-Finley Stadium (57,600) | Raleigh, N.C. \nTV : ABC/ESPN2 \nClemson Radio : Clemson Radio Network (WQSC-AM 1340 in Charleston) | Affiliates \nOpposing beat writer to follow : Joe Giglio, Raleigh News & Observer ( @jwgiglio ) \nLine : Clemson by 10.5 \nWhat to know about N.C. State : The Wolfpack are rated No. 3 in the country in total defense and No. 61 in total offense ... they averaged 46.3 points per game in non-conference play, but only put up 13 points in each its ACC losses to Louisville and Virginia Tech, before beating Wake Forest 35-17 Saturday ... running back Matthew Dayes, replacing all-ACC back Shadrach Thornton (who was dismissed from the team in September), ranks second in the ACC in rushing behind FSU’s Dalvin Cook. Dayes has 125 carries for 793 yards and a league-high 12 touchdowns ... Dayes has broken the 100-yard mark in all five N.C. State victories, including a career-best 205 vs. the Demon Deacons, but had 68 and 66 yards in the losses ... for the second straight week, Clemson is preparing to face a veteran starting quarterback with 10 touchdowns and one interception entering the game. Jacoby Brissett hasn’t been quite as dynamic as Brad Kaaya, though; while Brissett’s completing 67 percent of his passes, he’s only completing 7.3 yards an attempt, eighth best in the conference ... the Wolfpack have only captured six giveaways, but have only turned it over four times ... head coach Dave Doeren is a former Wisconsin defensive coordinator who went on to coach two years at Northern Illinois and win more games than anybody not named Nick Saban in 2011-12 ... Dave Huxtable, is in his third year as Doeren’s defensive coordinator. He previously served short stints coaching linebackers or defensive linemen at Pitt, Wisconsin, UCF, North Carolina, Oklahoma State, East Carolina, Georgia Tech and Western Kentucky. \nWhen last they met : Clemson 41, N.C. State 0 on Oct. 4, 2014 in Clemson : It was Clemson’s widest margin of victory over an FBS opponent of the 2014 season, when Deshaun Watson – in one of just three complete games he played as a freshman quarterback – completed 17 of 29 passes for 267 yards and two touchdowns, plus rushing for 62 yards and two scores ( including this leaping TD .) Brissett completed 4 of 18 passes for 35 yards, and Clemson recorded its first shutout in 16 years. \nAll-time series : Clemson leads 54-28-1, but holds a slim 19-16 lead in Raleigh. The Tigers have taken 10 of the last 11 matchups, including a 26-13 win their last trip to Raleigh when Clemson was the newly-minted No. 3 team in the country in 2013. However, the one loss during that span is the most memorable of all the games, because N.C. State’s 37-13 upset was the last time Clemson lost to an unranked opponent – 35 such contests ago. \nWhich Clemson Tiger is licking his chops : Junior defensive end Shaq Lawson, who had two sacks of Miami’s Brad Kaaya Saturday, has 5.5 sacks this season, had 2.5 tackles for a loss his last visit to N.C. State and now faces a Wolfpack front in the bottom third in the country in allowing sacks and TFLs. \nWho ’ s keeping the Clemson coaches up at night : Senior defensive end Mike Rose, coming off a three-sack game at Wake Forest and now leading the ACC with 6.5 sacks – one more than second-place Lawson. \nExtra point : N.C. State is 11th in the country in scoring defense, but 77th in opponents’ red-zone scoring. \n-AB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:22:22.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
