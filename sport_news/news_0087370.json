The 49ers are playing the Seattle Seahawks at the same time. And the NBA champion Warriors and the Sharks also have TV games Thursday night. \nCal receiver Stephen Anderson sees reasons to be optimistic. \n\"The Giants aren't in the playoffs -- that's a big thing,\" he said. \"I know the Niners are playing, but the Niners are having a bad year. I like our chances of getting a good amount of viewers.\" California head coach Sonny Dykes reacts to a call by officials during the first half an NCAA college football game against Washington, Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015, in Seattle. Cal won 30-24.

I don't feel like we responded to it that well. \n\"I think our guys will handle this better. At least I hope they will.\" \nThis is a big game for Cal (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12), which needs one more victory to become bowl eligible and seeks a win in Southern California for the first time since 2009. The Bruins (4-2, 1-2) are coming off defeats to Stanford and Arizona State by a combined margin of 36 points and will be desperate for a change of fortune. Advertisement \nCal faced a similar scenario a year ago, opening with a 4-1 record before slamming into the challenging portion of its schedule and losing all momentum. The Bears wound up 5-7 and out of the bowl picture. \nDykes believes this team -- older, deeper and far better on defense -- is ready to alter the script. \n\"Part of our maturation as a football program,\" Dykes said, \"is just believing we're good enough to win against good football teams on the road, especially when you don't play well.\" \nThe bye week should benefit Cal. While UCLA was pounded last Thursday night at Stanford, the Bears had the chance to heal physically and emotionally after letting go a game they could have won. \nQuarterback Jared Goff, who slipped out of the Heisman Trophy conversation after a five-interception performance at Utah, said he learned from his mistakes and has moved on. Offensive coordinator Tony Franklin made sure Goff understood he wasn't the first elite quarterback to have a rough outing. \n\"I told him (Peyton) Manning threw six picks in a game. Brett Favre threw six picks in a game,\" Franklin said. \"The shame of it was it was a game we could have won if he has a good ballgame. But that's part of it. He's got to overcome it, and he will.\" \nUCLA coach Jim Mora is expecting Goff's best effort. \n\"Goff is pretty darn special,\" Mora said. \"He has that mindset that all great quarterbacks have in that they're able to put a bad play behind them and keep going. \n\"As an observer of football, it's been fun to watch him develop. As somebody who has to play him, it's not that fun.\" \nDykes is encouraged by the fact that his team -- two years removed from a 1-11 season -- has posted five victories but still has room for growth. He's also a bit antsy to see it happen. \n\"I don't feel like we've played a complete game, where we've put it all together -- offense, defense and special teams,\" he said. \"We better start doing it pretty soon. We better do it Thursday.\" For more on Cal sports, see the Bear Talk blog at ibabuzz.com/beartalk .
