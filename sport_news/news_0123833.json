Back | Next Josh Galemore/Savannah Morning News\nKalin Scott of Islands High School is tackled by Savannah High’s Taemon Jenkins.\nBy Donald Heath\nAnthony Williams won’t have any problems remembering his first start at quarterback in high school.\nThe 5-foot-9, 160-pound junior threw for two scores and ran for another Friday night to lift Savannah High past Islands 27-6 during the Blue Jackets’ homecoming at Memorial Stadium.\nThe win propelled Savannah (3-6, 2-3 Region 1-AAA (B)) to play in a region crossover game on Nov. 6 against either the No. 1 or No. 2 seed from the 1-AAA (A) side.\nIf the Jackets win that game, they will advance to the state football tournament for the first time since 1995, SHS coach Tony Welch said.\nA first-time starter at quarterback — a decision Welch said he made five minutes before kickoff — put the Jackets in the rarefied position.\n“I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s a big moment,” said Williams, who had scoring tosses of 21 and 13 yards to Marshall Barber and Rasheen Biggins, respectively.\nWilliams also ran 3 yards for a touchdown.\nRashawn Morgan scored Savannah High’s fourth touchdown.\n“It felt good,” Williams said. “We had a push from the offensive line and everyone did their job. … From where we started and where we are now, we’ve come a long way.”\nIslands averted the shutout when running back Keion Pringle (20 carries, 73 yards) scored on a 14-yard run with 55.2 seconds left.\nBut the Sharks mustered little offense against a stingy SHS defense.\nIslands had just seven first downs in nine possessions and finished with 166 yards — 53 on the final possession.\nMeanwhile, the Blue Jackets had 279 yards — 103 through the air behind Williams’ 8-for-10 passing performance.\nWelch said Williams and Dez’mond Brinson had been neck and neck for the starting quarterback job throughout the season. Welch allowed the two to compete throughout practice during the week.\n“Whoever practiced the best was going to get to start,” Welch said. “(Williams) did well.”\nIslands (1-7, 0-4 Region 1-AAA (B)) had three of its five possessions inside Blue Jackets’ territory but just couldn’t make any plays to threaten as Savannah High took a 14-0 lead at halftime.\nOnly three of the Sharks’ 21 plays gained more than four yards during the opening 24 minutes and 46 yards of penalties kept the visitors in long-yardage situations.\nSavannah High, meanwhile, did enough to be comfortable. Barber outjumped an Island defender in the end zone for a Williams’ pass and a 21-yard touchdown to make it 7-0 on the Jackets’ opening possession.\nThe 76-yard drive was aided by a roughing-the-passer call to get SHS out of a second down-and-19 hole at the 45.\nMidway through the second quarter, Ahlik Fenn’s 50-yard punt return to the Sharks’ 29 midway set up the Jackets’ second score.\nWilliams and Biggins accounted for 28 yards on a pass play to the 1 before Morgan bulled in for the touchdown to make it 14-0.\nThe Jackets expanded the lead to 21-0 on Williams’ 3-yard TD run on the first play of the fourth quarter.\nA 68-yard interception return by Barber set up Williams’ 13-yard scoring toss to Biggins on SHS’ next possession.\nSuddenly, playoffs are a possibility.\n“The kids have bought into the system. They’re doing things the right way,” Welch said. “We’re blessed to be in this situation.”\nNote\nSavannah High honored the late Mede Lewis, a Blue Jackets running back who starred in the early 1990s, by retiring his No. 20 in a pregame ceremony Friday night.\nLewis, who died in 2009, was the Savannah Morning News’ Offensive Player of the Year in 1993 after he rushed for 1,362 yards and 23 touchdowns as a junior.\nAs a sophomore, Lewis ran for 1,150 yards and earned second-team all-city honors from the newspaper.\nIslands 0 0 0 6 — 6\nSav High 7 7 0 13 — 27\nSHS — Marshall Barber 21 pass from Anthony Williams (Rashad Denmark kick)\nSHS — Rashawn Morgan 1 run (Denmark kick)\nSHS — Williams 3 run (Denmark kick)\nSHS — Rasheen Biggins 13 pass from Williams (kick failed)\nIHS — Keion Pringle 14 run (run failed)", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14836195.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14836194.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14836192.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14836196.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14836193.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14836193.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14836196.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14836192.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14836194.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14836195.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:18:52.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
