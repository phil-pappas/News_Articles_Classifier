Wishing him the best. — Brendan Kuty (@BrendanKutyNJ) October 5, 2015 Big man makes a big move for himself and his family! Good for you and best of luck CC! — John Flaherty (@flash17yes) October 5, 2015 Major, major props to CC Sabathia for taking the step today, not tomorrow, not after playoffs, to get the help he needs now ❤️ — Kerith Burke (@KerithBurke) October 5, 2015 Addiction is a horrible disease.
