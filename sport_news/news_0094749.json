(OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Rogersville Lady Wildcats closed out what was supposed to be a rebuilding year with their fourth consecutive trip to the Class 3 Quarterfinals. Rogersville knocked off Aurora in two sets in the sectional round early in the day before falling to Pleasant Hill in two sets in the quarterfinals. Pleasant Hill came into the quarterfinal match with just two losses on the season, only dropping seven total games the entire year. The young Lady Wildcats, who only had one senior in the rotation, played without fear in the first game before falling 25-21. They couldn’t get anything going in the second game and were ultimately buried under a 9-1 run by Pleasant Hill in the 25-18 deciding game, as they had no answer for Pleasant Hill sisters Logan and Morgan Gish and their strong hitting.

We got a lot of touches on things,\" Rogersville head coach Tammy Miller said. \"The second game wasn't quite that same way.\" Miller called a timeout with her team down 19-9 in the second set, and she had a simple message for her team that has fought as the underdog all year long.\"They surpassed a lot of people's expectations. I was telling them that I think at one point we were 8-9 and we finished with an 18-2 run,\" Miller said. \"They didn't quit and they did exactly what I asked them to do in the last time out. I said keep them from scoring 25, and let's outscore them in this last little bit, and that is what they did. They fought. They played great defense late in the game. They kept going at them.\" Rogersville finished the deciding game on an 8-4 run before falling. Miller now says good bye to two seniors including key hitter Olivia Johnston.\"Late in the season she (Johnston) took (leadership) on her shoulders. She set work ethic with them. She meant everything to our kids,\" Miller said. Ashley McCallister was the team’s only other senior.\"Her loyalty to this team along with her leadership constantly being at practice for four years (was important),\" Miller said. \"They will both be greatly missed.\" Rogersville finished the season with a 26-11 record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:13:11.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
