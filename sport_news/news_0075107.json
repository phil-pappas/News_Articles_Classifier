You just want to be a ballplayer, and I think there's a certain amount of respect that you've got to have.\"\nThe Texas media didn't put it so politely.\nAccording to The Dallas Morning News writer Gerry Fraley , \"the Rangers have a new certified No. 1 villain: Jose Bautista.\"\n\"Bautista's histrionics, which included a world indoor record for the bat flip after the homer during an epic seventh inning, raised the Rangers' ire,\" he said.\nFor his part, Bautista says he doesn't remember what happened after his home run.\n\"I can't really remember what was going through my mind,\" he told reporters . \"After I made contact, you know, I didn't plan anything that I did, so I still don't even know how i did it.\"\n\"The bat flip? This is a celebration. He's allowed to do whatever he wants in my book,\" Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson added.\nIt wasn't just the media in the Lone Star state that took note of Bautista's bat flip.\nThe New York Times posted a story pondering if baseball has officially entered \"a golden age of celebratory antics\" after New York Mets slugger Yoenis Cespedes' flip on Monday at Citi Field and then Bautista's on Wednesday at Rogers Centre.\n\"(Cespedes') majestic flip would be reduced to a quaint memory two nights later, when Jose Bautista of the Toronto Blue Jays performed what might have been the most ostentatious bat flip in MLB history.\"\nWho flipped it better? #OwnOctober https://t.co/jVXRdGKdvF\nâ€” MLB (@MLB) October 15, 2015 Bautista's big blast to left field may have given the Blue Jays the lead, but it was self-inflicted defensive errors that set the stage for the Rangers' downfall.\nKevin Sherrington of the Dallas Morning News called the \"mind-boggling defensive collapse\" in Game 5 \"as bad as World Series nightmare\" from 2011.\n\"Here's how devastating the bottom of the seventh was: It nearly made you forget the top half of the inning, which only included one of the craziest plays in anyone's postseason history,\" he said.\nThat crazy play came at the top half of the inning when a rule even plate umpire Dale Scott admitted to not knowing allowed the Rangers to take the lead, followed by a showering of beer cans, water bottles and anything else Blue Jays fans could get their hands on to throw on the field.\nBut it was three big errors - one by Rangers first baseman Mitch Moreland and two by shortstop Elvis Andrus - that changed everything for Texas.\nAfter Andrus told reporters he felt he should have made both plays and that he let his team down, here's how Gil Lebreton put it for the Star Telegram :\n\"They were all simple answers and reeked of contrition. But what do you say at the gates of baseball hell?\"\nThank u guys for all the support in this though moment in my career this is just the beginning of something that is bigger than today game\nâ€” Elvis Andrus (@ElvisandrusSS1) October 15, 2015 So proud of this team.

As a @Rangers fan, the 3 errors leading up to it are what gets me. Gotta make plays. Jose did.\nâ€” Nathan Lovato (@CleanSpaceInc) October 15, 2015 I love the #TexasRangers . But hey #SamDyson and the rest of the #Rangers , if you don't like the #batflip , don't give up the big home run.\nâ€” Joey Sampson (@jsampsonlaw) October 15, 2015 Dear baseball gods, I think it's time to stop with the torture of Texas Rangers fans.\nâ€” Greg Pearson (@gregspearson) October 15, 2015 One day later, while disappointed in how @Rangers season ended, still proud of the year they had.\nâ€” Chris Fox (@silentkid70) October 15, 2015 Thank you Texas Rangers fans - found on the Blue Jays Facebook comments.
