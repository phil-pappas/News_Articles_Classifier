The Barnes brothers gave the Tornadoes (6-1) sole possession of first place in Suffolk V.\nEvan's goal came off a loose ball around 30 yards from the net. The midfielder fired a shot on net, which bounced off the crossbar and past Amityville's goalkeeper to give Harborfields a 2-0 lead less than 90 seconds into the second half.\nWhen Evan saw the ball coming toward him, he just reacted.\n\"I was thinking I may as well give it a shot, the ball just came out,\" Evan said. \"It's the best that could have happened.\"\nLatest HS sports stories High school inducts 20 athletes into hall of fame Cutinella's mom runs with his heart recipient Luglio scores only goal to lift Garden City Can Dalers slow down Syosset's Hogan, Elardo? Oyster Bay field hockey gets boost from big win His brother Benjamin, a four-year varsity player and current captain, smiled in approval as his brother took the shot and after the game.\n\"That was amazing,\" Benjamin said. \"Normally he doesn't shoot too much but when he does, that was just beautiful. It was great to watch. It was great for him.\"\nThe Tornadoes also got off to a quick start in the first half. Benjamin took a free kick from the left side around 18 yards out and found fellow senior Alex Bertossi cutting toward the net for the game's first goal less than four minutes into the game.\n\"I saw Alex make the run near post,\" Benjamin said. \"I figured put it right at him, see what happens.\"\nAnd Bertossi was expecting just that. \"I knew it was coming to me the whole way,\" he said. Bertossi got a foot on the ball midair to complete the goal.\nAmityville (5-2) defeated Harborfields, 2-0, Sept. 12 in the teams' first matchup. The Tornadoes knew the importance of this game to maintain position in League V. Amityville entered the game ranked No. 16 in Class A in the state and Harborfields was No. 18. Harborfields coach DJ Greening said Amityville will \"do damage in League V.\"\n\"It's huge to split, especially both splitting on away games,\" Greening said. \"We knew coming in this was their home turf, it was going to be a physical game. They are 5-1 for a reason. It's huge to get a couple of points here and start the second half of the season off right.\"\nThe immediate and long-term success of Harborfields boys soccer will be largely dictated by the Barnes family. The Tornadoes are looking for their first League V championship since 1982 and Greening was thrilled to see Evan score in a big game in his first year on varsity.\n\"Tremendous and reassuring for the future,\" Greening said. \"His brother is a four-year starter now so it's nice to see the family keeping it alive in Harborfields, but it's always nice to see the young players step up in games like this.\"\nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s high school sports weekly newsletter for the latest stories, scores and photos about Long Island high school sports events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:52:55.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
