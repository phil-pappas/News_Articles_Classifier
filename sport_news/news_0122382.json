Yanks lose, but will host wild-card test 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Baltimore\nAs they head into the playoffs, the New York Yankees won't spend much time thinking about what occurred during the regular season.\nAll that matters now is what happens next.\nThe Yankees stumbled into home-field advantage in the AL wild-card game, falling to the Baltimore Orioles 9-4 Sunday after a loss by Houston made the outcome meaningless.\nNew York will enter Tuesday's winner-take-all game against the Astros with little positive momentum after being swept in three games by Baltimore and losing six of its final seven regular-season games.\nTo that, the Yankees say: So what?\n\"Tuesday is a new day,\" manager Joe Girardi said. \"We wake up tomorrow, and it's a new day and we're where we want to be â€” we're in the playoffs.\"\nOn Sunday, the Yankees fell behind 7-1 in the fifth inning and stranded 11 runners. New York was 4-for-31 with runners in scoring position over the weekend, including 1-for-12 in the finale.\n\"You learn in baseball, to turn the page,\" first baseman Greg Bird said. \"If anything, it will be easier because now only one thing matters: the next game. It doesn't matter what we did for the last 162 games.\"\nAfter clinching a playoff berth on Thursday, New York needed just one win at Camden Yards to assure itself a game at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday. That victory never came, but that's partly because Girardi tried to balance the importance of winning against resting his starters and relievers.\nIt all worked out perfectly for the Yankees, anyway, as Arizona's 5-3 victory over Houston ended the Astros' bid to host on Tuesday. Had New York (87-75) and the Astros (86-76) finished tied, Houston would have won the tiebreaker for home field based on head-to-head record.\n\"It's nice that we're going home,\" Girardi said. \"The big thing is we're playing and we have a shot just like the other nine teams do.\"\nYankees starter Michael Pineda (12-10) lasted only 32/3 innings, allowing four runs and six hits. The right-hander has yielded a total of 11 runs in his last two outings.\nEight relievers followed, none of whom pitched more than an inning.\nMajor league home run leader Chris Davis connected twice for Baltimore, giving him 47 for the season. He also struck out for the 208th time, fifth-most in one season in big league history.\nPlaying perhaps his final game with the Orioles, Davis hit a two-run shot off Bryan Mitchell in the fifth and a two-run drive against Caleb Cotham in the eighth. The slugger will enter free agency coming off a season in which he drove in 117 runs.\nChris Tillman (11-11) gave up two runs and seven hits over 51/3 innings.\nBaltimore finished 81-81 after winning the AL East last year with a 96-66 record. Although they missed the playoffs, the Orioles were in contention for a wild-card berth until the final week and closed with a five-game winning streak to avoid what would have been their first losing season since 2011.\nOrioles third baseman Manny Machado failed to homer in a fifth consecutive game but completed the season as the only player in the majors to participate in all 162 games.\nBaltimore went up 2-0 in the first inning when Matt Wieters hit a two-run, two-out single.\nDoubles by Bird and Didi Gregorius got New York a run in the second before the Orioles chased Pineda with a three-run fourth.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/45/8739153/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/45/8739153/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:56:49.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
