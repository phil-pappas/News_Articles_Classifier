It’s absurd.\nThere are players there just because of their name,” he added. “Gigi deserves to be on the list for what he has achieved and how he has achieved it.\nAt nearly 38 years old, he is still one of the three best goalkeepers in the world. “Ok, I accept Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich) and (Thibaut) Courtois (Chelsea), but Bravo and Ospina? Normally a team’s results are taken into account and Gigi was one of the pillars of a team that made it to the Champions League final as well as winning the Serie A title.\n“Did you see his save against Dani Alves in (the) Berlin (final)?“ The Ballon d’Or longlist will be cut to 23 names in December before the awards ceremony is held in January 2016.\nThe last goalkeeper to win the prestigious award was Russian legend Lev Yashin in 1963, and although Buffon was not considered a potential winner the impact of his absence from the list has reverberated around Italian football.\nWhen the news emerged Friday, Gazzetta’s front page included a picture of a shocked-looking Buffon with the headline ‘Buffonata’, which roughly translates to ‘farce’ or ‘blunder’.\nFormer Italy goalkeeping legend Dino Zoff, meanwhile, said: “With (Cristiano) Ronaldo, (Lionel) Messi and (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic there’s no way he would win, but with 59 names on the list he should be on it.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:04:26.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
