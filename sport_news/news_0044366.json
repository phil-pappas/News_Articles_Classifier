He did drink alcohol from our bar, and was taking some herbal sexual enhancement capsules. At his request, he spent Monday evening alone in his suite,\" the statement said.\n\"It's incredibly sad,\" Hof told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \"He just wanted to get away, have a good time and relax.\"\nOdom emerged as one of the most promising basketball talents of his generation after a difficult childhood in Queens, where his mother died of cancer when he was 12 and his father was addicted to heroin.\nHe spent most of his 14-year NBA career in Los Angeles with the Lakers and Clippers, becoming a fan favorite and a beloved teammate of Kobe Bryant .
