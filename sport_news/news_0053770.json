They pulled ahead late in the 4th quarter and were able to preserve a 38-31 victory when Brian Randolph deflected a pass intended for the Bulldogs Malcolm Mitchell in the end zone.Neyland Stadium was delirious, as were Will and Colton Jumper. The brothers played at Baylor School in high school and both are now Volunteer players. Each is a walk-on, but Colton has experienced significant playing time.In fact, he started against Bowling Green at his inside linebacker position. His playing time has dwindled, but he's still a key member of the Vols special teams.Initially, Colton was headed for the Naval Academy. But a rare kidney condition detected in a battery of tests before enrolling changed his course. He enrolled at the Hun prep school in Princeton, New Jersey. He played football there for a year, then transferred to UT as a walk-on.His parents, along with Baylor coach Phil Massey, said it's a dream fulfilled.
