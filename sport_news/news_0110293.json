Niersbach explained that he only learned about the deal when he visited Beckenbauer at his Austrian residence on Tuesday. \nThe money paid back through FIFA in early 2005 from the World Cup organizing committee had been earmarked for an opening gala that had been canceled, Niersbach told reporters. \nFIFA responding by saying \"in general the FIFA finance committee is not authorized to receive payments in any way, nor does it have its own bank account.\" \nSpiegel reported that a cover for a slush fund was created with the help of FIFA. \nFormer Adidas chief Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who died in 2009, provided the funding, according to Spiegel, and asked for the money — by then worth 6.7 million euros — back before the tournament began. Dreyfus died in 2009. \nAccording to Niersbach on Thursday, Beckenbauer was ready to use his personal funds to secure the grant but was told by his advisers not to do so and the money was finally given to FIFA's financial committee by Louis-Dreyfus. \nFIFA said it was conducting an internal investigation and that it would be asking DFB for cooperation. \n\"That financial support of FIFA World Cup Organizing Committees should be coupled to any kind of financial advance payment by the respective organizing committee or the relevant football association in no way corresponds to FIFA's standard processes and regulations,\" the global governing body said in a statement. \nDFB is also investigating the case and has also asked an outside law firm to look into the affair as well. \nBeckenbauer's management said Thursday he would testify in the DFB initiated probe and would not make public statements for the time being. \nDer Spiegel reported Friday that a slush fund of 10.3 million Swiss francs (about $6 million at that time) was set up to buy the votes of four Asian representatives on the FIFA executive committee. \nSeparately, Beckenbauer at risk of sanctions if found guilty of obstructing then-FIFA prosecutor Michael Garcia's investigation into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. \n-- Nesha Starcevic \n10-man Rubin Kazan spoil Klopp's Anfield debut with 1-1 draw \nLiverpool was applauded off the field following its 1-1 draw against 10-man Rubin Kazan in the Europa League on Thursday but it's hard to imagine new manager Juergen Klopp offering his players the same sort of praise. \nElsewhere, Italian league leader Fiorentina lost 2-1 at home to Lech Poznan, and Lazio strengthened its hold at the top of Group G following a 3-1 win over Rosenborg. \nIt was a frustrating night for Klopp in his first match at Anfield as his side toiled in vain. \n\"The team is not full of self-confidence,\" Klopp said. \nKlopp saw his side fall behind early to striker Marko Devic's impressive half-volley. However, the Russian side lost captain Oleg Kuzmin to a second yellow card in the 36th minute, and within seconds Emre Can equalized. \nDespite the man advantage, wayward passes and poor finishing meant Liverpool had to settle for its third successive draw in Group B. \n\"We our still in the group. We have a situation that we can come back in and cold Kazan is the next challenge,\" Klopp added. \nSecond-half goals from Dawid Kownacki and Maciej Gajos secured victory for Lech Poznan, leaving Fiorentina bottom of Group I. \nStriker Giuseppe Rossi scored a last-minute consolation for the Viola, whose midfielder Ante Rebic was sent off in second-half stoppage time. \nLazio's win was all the more impressive after defender Mauricio's red-card dismissal in the sixth minute. Even a man down, goals from Alessandro Matri, Felipe Anderson and Antonio Candreva moved the Italian side three points clear at the top of its group. \nSaint-Etienne moved up to second behind the Rome-based club after a surprise 1-0 away win over Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Romain Hamouma scored shortly before the interval as the French side secured its first win of the group stage against last season's runner-up. \nIn Group K, substitute Leroy Sane salvaged a 2-2 draw for Schalke at home to Sparta Prague. His strike canceled out another replacement, David Lafata's effort, which gave the Czech side a second-half lead shortly after his introduction. \nAnderlecht came from behind to beat Tottenham 2-1 in Group J. Christian Eriksen gave the English Premier League side a fourth-minute lead, then Guillaume Gillet leveled with a well-taken volley. Stefano Okaka - on loan from Fulham - won it for the Belgian side with 15 minutes remaining. \nIn Group E, Villarreal thrashed Dinamo Minsk 4-0 with Cedric Bakambu's scoring a first-half brace, and Roberto Soldado and Eric Bailly were on target for the Spanish club after the restart. \nPortugal midfielder Alan scored the winner two minutes from time as Sporting Braga beat Marseille 3-2 in Group F. \nThe French side looked to have secured a point after late goals from Romain Alessandrini and Michy Batshuayi leveled matters. However, Alan's strike opened up a five-point lead for the Portuguese club. \nIn Group A, leader Molde beat Celtic 3-1 with Ola Kamara, Vegard Forren and Mohamed Elyounoussi scoring to open up a three-point lead for the Norwegian champions at the top of the table. \nStriker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat trick as Borussia Dortmund beat Qabala 3-1 to consolidate top spot in Group C. \n-- David Gerges \nDutch football great Cruyff has lung cancer \nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch football great Johan Cruyff is battling lung cancer, his spokeswoman said Thursday. \n\"He has been in hospital this week for tests and lung cancer has been confirmed,\" said Carole Thate, a spokeswoman for the 68-year-old former Ajax and Barcelona star. \nShe gave no further comment on Cruyff's condition, saying he was undergoing further tests. \nCruyff, who personified his country's attacking Total Football in the 1970s, was a smoker during his playing days and until undergoing an emergency heart bypass in 1991. Afterward, he became the face of an anti-smoking campaign. \nHis career began at Ajax and took him to Barcelona where, as player and later coach, his footballing philosophy laid the foundations for the dominant Barca teams of recent years. He was also one of the marquee stars, along with Franz Beckenbauer and Pele, who moved to play in the United States to raise soccer's profile there. Cruyff played for the Los Angeles Aztecs and Washington Diplomats. \nBarcelona financial vice president Susana Monje sent the club's best wishes to its former player and coach. \n\"We would like from the club to give Johan Cruyff and all of his friends a very big hug after hearing today of the situation that he is living through,\" Monje said. \nWorld football's governing body, FIFA, also sent its support, tweeting: \"Wishing a speedy recovery to the incomparable JohanCruyff. This is just another challenge to conquer.\" \nThe Dutch football association and Ajax also expressed shock and wished Cruyff and his family well. Cruyff took to Twitter to express his gratitude for the messages of support in Spanish, Dutch and English. \n\"Muchas gracias, Dank jullie wel, Thank you for all your support,\" Cruyff tweeted. \nA three-time European footballer of the year, Cruyff was synonymous with the \"Clockwork Orange\" Netherlands teams of the early 1970s whose attacking style earned the team fans around the world. \nWith Cruyff on the field, Ajax won the European Championship for three consecutive years from 1971-1973 before he moved to Barcelona in 1973 and led the middle-of-the-table team to its first national title in a decade. Cruyff was a star of the 1974 World Cup, where the Netherlands lost 2-1 in the final to West Germany. \n-- Mike Corder \nBrazil brings back Neymar for World Cup qualifiers \nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Barcelona star Neymar is back in Brazil's squad for the South American World Cup qualifying matches against Argentina and Peru in November. \nHe was absent in the first two games because of a four-match ban after being sent off in the Copa America, but was back in the squad called up on Thursday. \nCoach Dunga is under heavy pressure by fans after a 2-0 loss against Chile in Santiago and an unconvincing 3-1 victory against Venezuela in Brazil's first two qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup. The only new player on Dunga's list is Corinthians goalkeeper Cassio. \nBrazil will play Argentina in Buenos Aires on Nov. 12 and then hosts Peru in Salvador, Brazil, on Nov. 17. The Argentines have only one point in the World Cup qualifiers — including a 2-0 home loss to Ecuador. The Peruvians lost both of their first games. \nUEFA charges Man City for fans booing Champs League anthem \nNYON, Switzerland (AP) — UEFA has opened a disciplinary case against Manchester City for fans booing the Champions League anthem. \nThe governing announced the charge Thursday for the \"disruption of competition anthems\" a day after City's game against Sevilla. \nThe case will be heard by UEFA's disciplinary body on Nov. 19. \nCity's ownership and fans are aggrieved with UEFA over past sanctions for breaching Financial Fair Play rules. \nThe anthem jeering also comes at a time when UEFA's standing has been battered by allegations of wrongdoing involving senior officials. \nMichel Platini can't carry out his presidential role after being provisionally suspended by FIFA, pending the outcome of a full investigation into a payment. Senior vice president Angel Maria Villar is also waiting to discover if he'll be found guilty of obstructing an investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:56:45.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
