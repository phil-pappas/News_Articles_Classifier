A couple of local radio professionals, who first started calling Galesburg Silver Streaks sports together at WGIL in 1996 are as loyal to their teams as any fans you could find. Lee, a Roseville native, grew up watching the Cubs' Dave Kingman and Bill Buckner. Rick Monday was his favorite player back in the day. Bennewitz was raised in Washington and Hopedale and recalls the Cardinals' Ted Simmons catching his interest at first, then Keith Hernandez and Ozzie Smith earned his devotion. \"Everything Ozzie did was gold in my eyes,\" said Bennewitz, play-by-play voice of the Streaks and also a teacher at Galesburg High School. But despite their loyalty to the Cubs and Cardinals, no harsh words have been spoken and no painful putdowns exchanged during all those late-night road trips to and from Streaks games for the past 20 years. â€œIt's probably because we're baseball fans more than anything,\" said Bennewitz. \"He appreciates what the Cardinals have done to be successful. I appreciate what it takes to be a Cubs fan for a long time. \"I get it.\" For Lee, the tandem's color man and sideline reporter, and Bennewitz, keeping track of the first game of the playoff series between the teams was more difficult than usual Friday night. They had to broadcast the Western Big 6 Conference showdown between Rock Island and Galesburg while the baseball game was going on. That's nothing unusual for Bennewitz, who has juggled conflicting Streaks-Cardinals schedules often in the last 20 years due to the frequent appearances of St. Louis in the postseason and WGIL being a home station for the Cardinals. \"Getting updates from Brad made it so much easier,\" said Lee. \"If the Cubs had been playing someone else, I'd probably have had my microphone in one hand and my smart phone in the other. \"He's really good at keeping up on everything,\" said Lee. \"We call him the world's greatest multi-tasker.\" The humble Bennewitz says he's just doing his job. \"I consider it my responsibility if we're not carrying the Cardinals to give listeners updates every time I can if they're tuning in and instead they're hearing a Streaks football game,\" said Bennewitz. \"I feel it's my obligation.\" As a pro, Bennewitz said he felt his main focus needed to be on a big football game the Streaks were playing and that might haven taken away from him fully enjoying the excitement of the Cubs-Cardinals series. \"There was a little banter going on up in the press box (Friday),\" he said. Page 2 of 2 - \"I think now that the game has passed, I'll get more into it,\" said Bennewitz. No matter who wins, the series will certainly provide more topics for those Streaks road trips in the seasons ahead. \"We're able to dissect our own teams more than the other guys team,\" said Lee. \"We just know where our teams are most inept.\" And that leads to a few laughs on the highway. One of their favorite topics: obscure players from days gone by. \"It's fun,\" said Bennewitz. \"It triggers a play or a team from the past for sure.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:42:58.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
