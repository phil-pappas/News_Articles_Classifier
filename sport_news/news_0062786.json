Twice, the Eagles came close to forcing Newton to fumble but couldn't knock the football out of the viselike grip of his right hand. Similarly, after back-to-back encroachment penalties by nose tackle Bennie Logan advanced the line of scrimmage to the Eagles' 2-yard line, Newton gave the Panthers a 14-3 late in the second quarter by carrying off left tackle, keeping the ball in his right hand, and stretching it across the goal line. \nLater, in the fourth quarter, Newton rushed up the middle of the Eagles' defense for a 16-yard gain as part of a drive that led to a field goal, breaking free and rumbling toward Eagles safety Walter Thurmond. Thurmond is 5-foot-11 and 190 pounds; Newton is 6-foot-5 and 245. It was, needless to say, a bit of a mismatch. \nBut the Eagles had problems both apart from and linked to Newton and the need to guard against what he could do. The Panthers pounded them for 204 rushing yards - \"We didn't do a good job holding up,\" Davis said - and gashed them for seven plays that gained at least 20 yards. And no play better illustrated the effect of a quarterback such as Newton - the kind of mobile, big-armed quarterback that Chip Kelly just can't seem to find for his own offense - than a key moment Sunday. And Newton was involved only as a decoy. \nFrom the Panthers' 49, Newton took the snap and rolled to his right, and the Eagles' defense moved like an amoeba with him, as if he were Justin Bieber and the 11 Eagles on the field were all lifelong US Weekly subscribers. Except Newton then flipped the ball to wide receiver Ted Ginn on a reverse, and when Marcus Smith (yes, he was on the field) failed to establish and maintain the backside edge, Ginn zoomed 43 yards down the empty left side of the field to the Eagles' 8-yard line. Two plays and those two Logan penalties later, Newton scored. \n\"Cam has a lot of athletic ability, and it does pose a lot of challenges,\" Thurmond said last week. \"You rely on your defensive line to get after the quarterback and make him throw from a tight pocket and, on the back end, playing tight coverage and make hard throws for him. We all work hand in hand. . . . Everyone's on a string, you know?\" \nThe Eagles did all they could Sunday night to keep that string from breaking, and if their receivers hadn't dropped so many passes, if their offense were just a little more competent, the defense's effort might have been enough. It wasn't. This was a different Cam Newton from last year's, and over those few big plays, with the way he can occupy a defense's every instinct and action, he demonstrated what he can do this year, and what the Eagles can't.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:11:06.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
