They call the newspaper with fresh numbers early every morning for that day's weather page, on the back of the sports section. The only pay is an annual gathering - sometimes a picnic hosted by the newspaper, sometimes dinner at an area restaurant - where they are honored and thanked. Necessary equipment, which the volunteers must provide themselves, are a thermometer that records the high and low temperatures of the day and a rain gauge. They must also submit snow depths and melt snow, when they get it, to include its water content with their precipitation. Volunteers are needed right now in , Tuolumne, Pinecrest and San Andreas. Anyone interested in becoming a volunteer may call Pam Orebaugh 588-4546 or e-mail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:33:42.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
