No toppling of Goliath. \nInstead, Austin Peay’s Homecoming game Saturday against STATS FCS No. 1 Jacksonville State went just as expected. \nThe Gamecocks trounced APSU (0-8, 0-5 OVC) 27-7 after limiting essentially all offensive efforts from the Governors in the first half that allowed Jacksonville State to coast for the later portion of the game. \n“We knew they were big. We knew they were fast,” sophomore Zach Stuart said. “I mean you can lose on any given day.” \nStuart had five tackles, shared a sack and had a fumble recovery during the second quarter. \nAt halftime, Austin Peay had minus-2 yards of total offense, no scores and no second downs. \n“I’ve never seen that,” said APSU football coach Kirby Cannon. \nFor the majority of the first half, Austin Peay was a no-show. Drive-after-drive ended in being forced to punt as the Govs failed to break through Jacksonville’s nationally ranked rush defense. \nThose problems were not found in the Gamecocks’ play book. Troymaine Pope ran in a 10-yard score at the 10:51 mark in the first quarter for the first touchdown of thegame. Connor Rouleau tacked on a 30-yard field goal six minutes later. \nJacksonville’s momentum continued in the second quarter with Miles Jones making a yard run for the touchdown with 12:03 on the clock. Rouleau’s 28-yard field goal boosted the Gamecocks to an easy 20-0 lead. \nOpportunity arose after Austin Peay’s Stuart recovered a fumble on its own 48-yard line, but was unable to capitalize. \nWith just 33 seconds left, Jacksonville State made another touchdown on quarterback Eli Jenkins' 1-yard run. \nAustin Peay would move quickly to near midfield, but Trey Taylor overshot his receivers three straight passes and that forced APSU to punt to end the half. \nIn what has become standard, Austin Peay returned to the field in the third quarter looking comfortable. APSU controlled Jacksonville State’s offensive attempts and even added a touchdown of its own on a Trey Taylor to Jared Beard 5-yard pass. \n“I felt like we came out with a different mentality in the second half,” said Stuart . “We didn’t care if they were the first team in the nation or the last team in the nation. We wanted to give 100 percent effort 100 percent of the time.” \nJacksonville State put the game on cruise-control with a third-string quarterback leading the offense in the fourth quarter as the Gamecocks eased into the 27-7 final after a called-back Wesley Thomas juggling-catch-touchdown. \nThe score was called back because Thomas stepped back into bounds, but he was the second one to touch the ball after a JSU defensive back tipped it first. \n“Worst call I’ve ever seen,” Cannon said. “Yes, he did go out, but the rule is pretty simple. If you come back in and are the first person to touch it, it’s a penalty. But if you are the second person … and I’m sure everybody in the stadium saw their DB tip it back to us.” \n“It’s hard to believe that seven referees didn’t see what everybody saw.” \nAustin Peay returns to the road for a Halloween bout at Tennessee State on Saturday, Oct. 31. \nReach Autumn Allison at aallison@theleafchronicle.com or 931-245-0248.
