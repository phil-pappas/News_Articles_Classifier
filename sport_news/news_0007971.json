Both teams enter the game with four wins (Hesperia Christian is 4-1, Lucerne Valley is 4-3) and both have similar ratings on calpreps.com (Lucerne at 26.1, Hesperia at 21). Lucerne Valley head coach Chris Klinger also thinks the two teams are built similarly. He’s less certain that the team’s similarities will prove to be a positive for either side. It should make for a good football game, though. Last year, in a down year for the Mustangs, the Patriots won 66-44, one of three Agape League wins. This year, Hesperia Christian features largely the same core while the Mustangs have grown into a team to be reckoned with. Last year, Lucerne Valley had just five seniors on its roster. This year that number grew to 11. That extra experience has paid dividends. Senior Zack Mejia has 19 touchdowns, already 11 more than he did a season ago. Lucerne Valley finished last season with 32 touchdowns — the Mustangs already have 39 this year. For Hesperia Christian, the core of Trevor Bragg, Austin Luton and Zach Shilling continue to deliver. 24 touchdowns are split between six players, with Shilling, Bragg and Luton accounting for 16 of those. It’s no question the game will feature offense. Hesperia Christian averages 49.2 points per game while Lucerne Valley averages 43.7. The biggest question will be how the Mustangs’ defense deal with the Patriots’ offense. Lucerne Valley is allowing an average of 39.4 points per game, albeit against tough competition. The game is set to kick off at 7 p.m. in Lucerne Valley.
