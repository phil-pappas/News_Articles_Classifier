Then there were other shots that followed,\" Rivalde said by phone.\nShe said the reservation had been made shortly before lunch for the consul general's birthday, and the group had ordered a banquet that included popular local delicacies such as tuna head, shrimps and roasted pork.\n\"They ordered a lot of food, but no liquor,\" she said.\n BULLET THROUGH THE NECK Song was shot in the neck, but his injuries were not believed to be life threatening and he was in a stable condition in hospital, regional police chief Tom Banas told AFP. \"The bullet went clear through (his neck),\" Banas said.\nPolice identified his dead staff members as Sun Shan, the deputy consul general, and Hui Li, a finance officer.\nBanas said the husband and wife were arrested without any resistance. But he said they had not immediately co-operated with police, and so the details of the shootings and the motives were not known.\n\"They claimed they can not speak English. Maybe they don't want to give a statement,\" he said, adding they had a lawyer.\nLighthouse manager Stephen John Patero said staff did not see the shooting because only the guests were in the private room at the time. But he said waiters who served them beforehand had heard the guests shouting at each other.\n\"They are all friends who apparently figured in an argument,\" he said.\nSong was born in October, 1962, according to a biography published on news website Sina News.\nHe has been a career diplomat, joining the foreign ministry in 1987 then serving in New Zealand, Japan and Hong Kong before his current posting, according to the biography.\nA spokeswoman at the Chinese embassy in Manila, Li Lingxiao, said she could not yet comment. \"Our embassy is still verifying the facts. We'll update you as soon as I have anything new,\" Li said in a text message to AFP.\nPhilippine foreign ministry spokesman Charles Jose also said he had no comment, as authorities were still determining what happened.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:07:13.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
