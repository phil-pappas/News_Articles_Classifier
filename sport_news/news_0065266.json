He broke his leg early in Sunday's 22-20 win over the Oakland Raiders, forcing the Bears to juggle an already short-handed line. \nMatt Slauson shifted from left guard and spent most of the game at center. Newly acquired Patrick Omameh came in at Slauson's regular spot. The Bears already were without starting left tackle Jermon Bushrod because of a concussion and shoulder injury. \nMontgomery has appeared in 110 games and made 75 starts — 58 at center — for Carolina (2006), the New York Jets (2007-08), Washington (2008-13), Denver (2014) and Chicago (2015). \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:17:57.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
