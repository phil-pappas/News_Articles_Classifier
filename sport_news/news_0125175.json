Both teams started out strong, keeping each other scoreless in the first quarter. In the second quarter Chaparral jumped out ahead on two touchdowns to lead 15-0. Douglass answered with Hunter Chadic running three yards into the end zone to put the Bulldogs on the board. The two-point play failed and the Bulldogs trailed 15-6 at halftime. In the third quarter Chaparral took the game. They scored 19 unanswered points to lead 34-6 going into the final quarter. Chaparral scored first in the fourth quarter. Their touchdown was followed by a 69-yard pass by Chadic to Devon Anderson for the second Bulldog touchdown of the night. The two-point play again was unsuccessful and the Bulldogs fell 41-12. kA 4=2DDlQAbQmx?
