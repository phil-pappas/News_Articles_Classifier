His other choice was Alex Wood, but Mattingly wanted his ace on the mound in a critical game.\n\"He’s pretty good,\" Mattingly said. \"I mean, we just feel like he’s that guy, no matter if we’re down 2-1 or up 2-1. We feel like he’s the right guy.\"\nKershaw, who went 16-7 with a 2.13 ERA and 301 strikeouts during the regular season, yielded three runs on four hits in 6 2/3 innings in Game 1 on Friday. He threw 113 pitches.\nStarting on three days’ rest doesn’t concern him.\n\"I think the adrenaline takes over,\" Kershaw said. \"You don’t really feel tired or anything like that.\"\nKershaw would know because he’s been in this situation twice before.\nLast season, he started Game 1 of the NLDS against the Cardinals and was rocked for eight runs in 6 2/3 innings. He then started Game 4 on three days’ rest, yielding three runs in six innings.\nIn 2013, he was on the mound for Game 1 of the NLDS against the Braves and pitched seven innings of one-run ball. Four days later in Game 4, he gave up two unearned runs in six innings.\nDespite his regular-season dominance throughout his career, Kershaw often has struggled in the postseason. He’s 1-6 in 12 playoff games (nine starts) with a 4.99 ERA.\nRegardless, the Mets aren’t looking forward to facing the lefty.\nBefore Mattingly announced his decision, Mets manager Terry Collins was asked whether he had a preference for a Los Angeles starter. Collins made it clear that he did.\n\"Would I have any preference? Yeah, I got a preference,\" Collins said amid laughs. \"Believe me, this is no slap at Alex Wood. He’s a fine pitcher, but I don’t want to see that other monster on the mound.\"\nCollins and Kershaw have known each other since 2006, when the Dodgers drafted the pitcher with the seventh overall pick. Collins was Los Angeles’ minor league director.\n\"He was tough, tough-minded,\" Kershaw said, \"but at the same time he was very honest, which I thought was pretty cool.\"\nAlthough he hadn’t been told anything official until Monday afternoon, Kershaw said the thought of possibly starting Game 4 already was in the back of his mind. After a slight adjustment to his routine between starts, the 27-year-old is ready.\nShort rest or not, he’s out to show Mattingly that he made the right choice. \n\"It’s a good feeling to know that your manager wants you out there,\" Kershaw said. \nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:23.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
