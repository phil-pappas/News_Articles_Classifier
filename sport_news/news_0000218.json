Despite circling it first on the 2015-16 calendar back in May, the Tampa Bay Lightning fell to the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-2 Tuesday night at Cambria County War Memorial Arena in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.\nAdChoices Tonight’s game was a part of a long-term promotional campaign led by Kraft Hockeyville USA. It became pretty obvious in the pregame that the 1977 film Slap Shot was a majority reason this game existed, as tonight’s venue was the primary filming location for the movie. It did at least provide some in-game entertainment between scene reenactments from NBC’s broadcasting staff as well as coach Jon Cooper and forward Ryan Callahan , who served as an alternate captain tonight along with Ondrej Palat .\nThe Lightning traveled locked and loaded with a lineup that featured Stammer, Hedman, and the Triplets, while the Penguins drove just a little over an hour east leaving Sidney Crosby , Marc-Andre Fleury , and even Phil Kessel at home.\nTonight was a test for each team’s goaltending depth. Pittsburgh’s Matt Murray is looking to solidify himself as Fluery’s every night back up, while Kristers Gudlevskis made his second preseason appearance as the Lightning still determine Ben Bishop ’s backup for the first few months of the season.\nIt was pretty much Pittsburgh’s game from puck drop, as the Penguins took the lead just 14 seconds into the game. Sergei Plotnikov , one of the Pens’ many offseason free agency signings, stole the puck from Anton Stralman in front of the crease and backhanded it over Gudlevskis.\nBrian Boyle , who appeared in his second preseason game tonight, put the Lightning on the board with a Martin St. Louis –like backhanded shot while driving toward the net. The Penguins took the upper hand going into the first intermission though from a sniper by Ian Cole in the left circle.\nThe Lightning went on an early power play in the second period after Cole tripped Nikita Kucherov rushing into Pittsburgh’s zone. The Bolts were unable to execute, and failed again five minutes later when Conor Sheary went to the box for hitting J.T. Brown from behind, causing a few exchanged shoves. Steven Stamkos had a close chance after a tic-tac-toe play from Tyler Johnson and Palat, but Murray flashed the leather.\nJonathan Drouin has continued to impress this preseason and kept the Lightning’s chances alive from a dirty deke that landed the puck right top shelf with assists from Stamkos and Callahan. Considering Drouin had a thumb injury this time last year that kept him sidelined for the first few weeks of the season, this time around has been a much better start for him. Drouin's goal, however, would be the peak of Tampa Bay’s evening.\nWhen Stralman went to the penalty box for hooking, Pittsburgh began to take advantage. During the 10-minute TV timeout, newcomer Kevin Poulin came out to replace Gudlevskis in net. He was not greeted well. Minutes in, Evgeni Malkin stayed aggressive around the Lightning net and buried the puck home on his own rebound, giving the Peguins a 3-2 lead.\nWith over a little three minutes left in the second period, Pittsburgh scored its fourth goal, until it was called off due to goaltender interference by Chris Kunitz , who was immediately sent to the box. Penguins coach Mike Johnston was visually displeased with the call, but opted not to use a coach’s challenge.\nNo worries though, because the Pens managed to get that fourth goal moments later on a fluke shot by Adam Clendening while shorthanded.The puck was fired from behind the net and deflected off Poulin’s back, very similar to Brad Richards ’ overtime goal in Game 3 vs. Montreal in the second round of the 2004 playoffs.\nThe third period was pretty dull compared to the first two, with no scoring and few power play oppourtunites for each team. Tampa Bay was unable to add to its tallies, and the Penguins fought the off Bolts to secure a 4-2 victory in front of a sold out, energized crowd of 4,000.\nWith only one win to its name this preseason, Tampa Bay will head back home to face the Dallas Stars for the second time in five days as the team looks to improve its current preseason record of 1-3-1. Opening night is ten sleeps away, and tonight's exhibition suggests the Lightning can still use some more time to work on adapting back to a consistent playing mode after an abbreviated offseason.\nGame notes :\nBecause this game was played in an unofficial NHL building, no box score was kept. Victor Hedman left tonight's game in the second period with an undisclosed minor injury and did not return. His current condition is day-to-day . Tampa Bay was 0/5 on the power play, while Pittsburgh was 0/2 but did score a shorthanded goal. Jonathan Drouin’s goal tonight puts him at five points (two goals, three assists) this preseason, leading the Lightning. Gudlevskis and Poulin both split time evenly in tonight's game and each gave up two goals. Tonight's power play unit for the Bolts consisted of the Triplets along with Stamkos and Stralman.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/152282/j-t-brown", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/198473/jonathan-drouin", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/55065/martin-st-louis", "https://twitter.com/TBTimes_JSmith/status/649051510945488896", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/54838/marc-andre-fleury", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/257866/conor-sheary", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/54562/brian-boyle", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/pittsburgh-penguins", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/55428/sidney-crosby", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/54511/chris-kunitz", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/tampa-bay-lightning", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/132337/adam-clendening", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/144071/ondrej-palat", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/129886/tyler-johnson", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/132436/nikita-kucherov", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/54905/phil-kessel", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/54828/ben-bishop", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqvnc7cdzSE", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/108054/ian-cole", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/55082/steven-stamkos", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/54197/ryan-callahan", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo46AA8OpzI", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/54306/anton-stralman", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/257584/sergei-plotnikov", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/88686/kevin-poulin", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/198477/kristers-gudlevskis", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/55425/evgeni-malkin", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/55200/brad-richards", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/157284/matthew-murray"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:43:45.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
