I don't consider Buffalo's win over Indianapolis a signature win, because the Colts are mediocre this season. But a win over a very good Cincinnati team would turn some heads, and, more important, it would put the Bills two games over .500.

Andy Dalton is having a great season, and their defense is for real, too.
