Edgar Thompson Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel \nBATON ROUGE, La. — DBU was crumbling, quarterback Treon Harris was scrambling for his life and the Florida Gators unbeaten season was hanging by a thread. \nBut with actor Tom Cruise on hand in Tiger Stadium, the No. 8 Gators nearly staged their own version of Mission Impossible on Saturday night at No. 6 LSU. \nThe Gators fought back from two 14-point deficits and eventually caught the Tigers, tying the game at 28-28. But LSU coach Les Miles — a.k.a. the Mad Hatter — had a plot twist of his own. \nA fake field goal that kicker Trent Domingue ran in for a 16-yard touchdown with 10:40 remaining proved the difference during the Tigers’ 35-28 win. \n“It was a heck of a call, a gutsy call,” Florida coach Jim McElwain said. “It’s kind of a badge of honor. They’ve got to fake one to beat us.” \nDespite their first loss during the McElwain era, the Gators (6-1-, 4-1 SEC) remain in the SEC East division driver’s seat entering the team’s bye week. Florida next will face Georgia Oct. 31 in Jacksonville.

It will really will.” \nThe Gators’ best chance to complete the upset effectively ended when LSU cornerback Dwayne Thomas broke up a pass for Antonio Callaway in the endzone, ripping the ball out of the hands of the freshman receiver. \nCallaway later came up with a 41-yard catch to move the Gators to their 49-yard line. But the game ended with four straight incomplete passes by sophomore quarterback Treon Harris, who was 2-of-10 for 40 yards on the final two drives. \nPICTURE GALLERY: Check out pictures from the NCAA football game between the Florida Gators and LSU Tigers at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, La. \nCallaway — the hero of Florida’s Sept. 26 against Tennessee — had done his best Ethan Hunt impression to keep the Gators (6-1, 4-1 SEC) in the game against the Tigers (6-0, 4-0). \nCallaway’s one-handed, 48-yard catch set up a 19-yard touchdown by tight end Jake McGee to cut LSU’s lead to 21-14. With Florida trailing 28-21, Callaway returned a punt 72 yards up the sideline for a touchdown, becoming the first Gators’ freshman to score on a punt return during an SEC game. \n“He had a heck of a game,” McElwain said. “I’m glad he’s on our team.” \nCallaway’s return silenced a sell-out crowd of 102,321 in Death Valley, where the Tigers are now 46-4 in Saturday night games under Miles. \nBut the Tigers answered behind Heisman frontrunner Leonard Fournette, quarterback Brandon Harris and Miles, whose daring play calling had flummoxed the Gators in the past. \nDuring the 11-play, 75-yard game-winning drive, Fournettte rushed for 45 yards on six carries and Harris completed a 14-yard pass on third-and-six before LSU stalled on its 16. The Tigers set up for a 16-yard field goal, but at the snap Domingue sprinted left and holder Brad Kragthorpe hit him in stride, throwing from from his knees. \nThe fact Miles and the Tigers needed a fake field goal to beat the Gators told McElwain a lot about the resilience of his team. \nThe Gators were on their heels throughout the first half as their vaunted secondary struggled against much-maligned LSU sophomore quarterback Brandon Harris. \nFocused on stopping Fournette, the Gators' defensive backfield - and claimants to the fictional title of Defensive Back University - gave up several big plays to Harris and his talented receivers. \nHarris threw two first-half touchdown passes, including a 50-yard hookup with Malachi Dupre 15 seconds before halftime to give LSU a 28-14 lead. \n“I thought we tried to do too much on defense,” McElwain said. “Guys were just a little out of sorts.” \nLSU’s Brandon Harris finished 13-of-19 passing for 202 yards, going 5 of 9 for 98 yards and two touchdowns on third down. Fournette finished with 180 rushing yards on a season-high 31 carries and two touchdowns. He averaged 5.8 yards — well below his season average of 8.6 entering the night. \nDespite his late-game struggles, Treon Harris acquitted himself well during his first start since the season opener. Harris was thrust into the starting role when starter Will Grier was suspended Monday for violating the NCAA’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. \nHarris finished 17-of-32 passing for 271 yards and two touchdowns, but he was indecisive at times and took five sacks. \n“I thought Treon played his tail off,” McElwain said. \nMcElwain felt his entire team did, even if the Gators came up short. \n“We're better than that, and our guys know it,” McElwain said. “I'm not mad at them. They played hard. \n\"There could have been a lot of reasons for everybody, oh these guys will fall apart. But no, we didn’t. And I didn’t expect we would.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:00:04.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
