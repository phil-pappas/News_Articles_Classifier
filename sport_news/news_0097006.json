He also heavily criticized Ferreira's decision not to field star playmaker Ayman Hefni in the starting line-up.\nThe controversial lawyer, who spent big in two successive summer transfer windows to bolster an underachieving squad, said he would try to force Ferreira out by appointing two assistant coaches who would have the upper hand in squad selection.\nZamalek fans took to the social media to support the former Porto boss, insisting they would not accept a rash decision to show him the door little less than a month after he led to the club to a 2-0 victory over Ahly in the Egypt Cup final, their first Cairo derby triumph since 2007.\nMansour eventually gave Ferreira a reprieve as Zamalek face Wadi Degla in their Egyptian Premier League opener on Wednesday.\n\"The board of directors had decided not to make any changes to the football team's technical staff until convening again following the Wadi Degla match,\" a club statement read, suggesting that any stumble in the league opener would not be tolerated.\nLocal media said Ferreira, 69, was furious after being attacked by Mansour but said he appreciated the support shown by the fans and players alike.\nZamalek have an embarrassment of riches in midfield, with new arrival Mahmoud Kahraba in particular wreaking havoc upfront with his pace and mesmerizing skills.\nTheir rock-solid defence, which only leaked 21goals last season, remains intact but Zamalek are still unlikely to enjoy a smooth ride after bitter foes Ahly also strengthened their squad.\nZamalek will miss right-back and skipper Hazem Emam against Wadi Degla after he was banned for two games for invading the pitch to take part in a confrontation with Ahly players during the Super Cup.\nHamoudi was also left out of the squad because of injury.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:22:31.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
