Senior QB Gage Cabalar led the Bombers’ offense with 93 yards and a TD on 19 carries. \n* Senior RB Sean Mefford scored both Butler TDs in the Bulldogs’ 14-7 overtime win against Morris Catholic. Mefford finished the game with three catches for 55 yards, including a 33-yard TD catch in the first quarter, and four carries for 44 yards, the last of which went for a 4-yard TD in OT to win the game. Junior MLB Cory Mack (10 tackles) and junior DL Alfred Battipede (nine tackles) were defensive standouts. \n* Don Bosco senior K Ethan Cordaro showed poise under pressure and a strong leg during the Ironmen’s 19-16 loss to Paramus Catholic. Cordaro drilled a 36-yard FG that would’ve been good from at least 46 yards with 2:46 left in the game. Don Bosco accepted a roughing-the-kicker penalty on that play, though, which took three points off the board and eventually left Cordaro to make another FG, a 23-yarder that gave Don Bosco a 16-13 lead with 1:42 to go. \n* Keep an eye on Glen Rock junior QB Matt Schlett. He has helped the surging Panthers to four straight wins. Schlett has thrown for 561 yards and three TDs, and rushed for 306 yards and 10 TDs in five games. \n* Lakeland senior RB Kyle Novotny made the most of his four carries in a 42-14 victory over NV/Demarest. Novotny gained 101 yards on the ground and scored two TDs. Senior CB Jake Catalioto intercepted two passes and defended three more for the Lancers. \n* Senior MLB Matt DeMarco was instrumental in Lyndhurst upsetting Garfield, 30-21. He made 14 tackles, three of which went for losses. Senior CB Leo Gonzalez recorded five tackles and returned an interception 20 yards for a fourth-quarter TD for the Golden Bears. \n* Mahwah is getting a lot of mileage out of its one-two offensive punch of senior QB James Ciliento and senior RB Zayjay Colon-Carrero. In five games, Ciliento has thrown for 399 yards and seven TDs and run for 442 yards and eight TDs. Colon-Carrero has carried 70 times for 415 yards and six TDs. \n* North Arlington senior QB Michael Manzo-Lewis rushed for 163 yards and four TDs on 22 carries and completed 15 of 27 passes for 199 yards in the Vikings’ 38-34 loss to Park Ridge. \n* Senior RB Zach DeNike continues to be a key cog in NV/Old Tappan’s offensive machine. He rushed 12 times for 130 yards and a TD in a 38-14 win over Indian Hills, giving him 528 rushing yards and six TDs on only 46 carries in five games. \n* Senior QB/DB JoJo Robinson continues to be a bright spot for Palisades Park/Leonia. In five games, he has 935 all-purpose yards, including 491 rushing yards (seven TDs) and 344 passing yards (two TDs). Robinson also has two interceptions. \n* Colin Dedrick’s chemistry with senior WR Mike Pimpinella has resulted in impressive passing numbers for the Pascack Valley senior QB. In five games, he has thrown for 872 yards and 12 TDs and has been intercepted only once, in the Indians’ opener against Hackensack. \n* Senior RB Justin Brunda rushed for three TDs and senior QB Tommy Crooks ran for two scores to lead Pequannock (4-1) to its third straight win, 35-13 at Hopatcong. \n* Junior QB Derick Suazo threw three TD passes as Queen of Peace beat Bogota, 30-14, to snap a six-game losing streak. \n* In addition to his 19-yard TD catch on fourth down, Ridgefield Park’s senior OL/DT Steve Orozco had 12 tackles, including three for losses, and 1 1/2 sacks in the Scarlets’ 24-9 win over Pascack Hills. Orozco finally is healthy after dislocating a shoulder in the season opener against Teaneck. \n* Ridgefield Park is 5-1 and in a solid position in the North 2, Group 3 playoff picture. Coach Pete Kraljic is quick to credit his assistants – who include former Westwood head coach Billy Straub (offensive coordinator), another former head coach in Dan Morris (defensive coordinator) and line coach Kurt Schwarz. \n* Ridgewood junior Austin Denise made his varsity debut as a punter in a 30-14 win over Clifton and averaged 38 yards on five kicks. Denise dropped two kicks inside the 20-yard line and two more inside the 10. He punted in the absence of the injured Zack Feagles (concussion). \n* Senior RB Kevin Kosakowski continued to produce in Rutherford’s 49-14 win over Manchester. He carried 13 times for 127 yards and two TDs to increase his season totals to 57 carries, 518 yards and 11 TDs in four games. Sophomore RB/CB Billy Finn also played well, finishing with 81 yards and two TDs on eight carries. He also intercepted a pass. \n* Senior RB Tyshaun Horton had 220 rushing yards for Wallington in a 44-14 loss to Wood-Ridge. Horton had 192 of those yards in the first half and also contributed eight tackles from his linebacker spot. He registered all five of the Panthers’ first downs in the opening half. \n* Junior Grant Ferraulio, Wayne Valley’s backup QB, played well in relief of standout senior Nick Goodwin during a 44-20 win against Tenafly. Goodwin suffered an undisclosed injury during the second quarter and his status is uncertain for the Indians’ game at Northern Highlands on Friday night. Ferraulio completed 7 of 8 passes for 103 yards and three TDs and wasn’t intercepted. \n* Wood-Ridge has won two of its last three and the catalyst has been senior TB/LB Josh Paez, During that stretch, he has rushed for 792 yards, six TDs and five two-point conversions, in addition to making 32 tackles. \n* If Wood-Ridge beats Bogota on Saturday, it’ll mark the first time the Blue Devils (2-3) are .500 this late in a season since 2007, when they finished 6-4. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:54:51.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
