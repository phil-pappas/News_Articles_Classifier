My invention enables the golfer to keep his or her eyes on the putter, the ball and the alignment line in order to improve his or her putting game.\"\nHe created a prototype for the TRAINING AID FOR PUTTING to assist with aligning the ball with the putter face. This trains the golfer to keep his or her eyes on the ball when putting. The accessory ensures that putter's face strikes the ball squarely so that the ball rolls in the intended direction. Additionally, the unit increases confidence in your putting game and leads to lower scores.\nThe original design was submitted to the Orange County office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
