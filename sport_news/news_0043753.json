(Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) (JULIE BENNETT) Comments \nA couple of new faces could have an opportunity to help boost the interior of Auburn's defensive line, which has been a major contributing factor to the SEC's worst rush defense. \nTrue freshman Jauntavius Johnson and redshirt freshman Andrew Williams are being prepped to play in Thursday night's game at Kentucky. \nThe addition of Johnson, a 323 pound true freshman who has yet to play, could be particularly helpful to plugging running lanes. \nDefensive coordinator Will Muschamp considers Johnson, who tore his ACL during his senior season at Lincoln, capable of playing as a zero technique/nose tackle or traditional defensive tackle. \n\"He's been solid,\" Muschamp said. \"When you have a bigger guy, (coming off a knee injury) takes a little longer as far as the pounding and all that. They've got to take on the double-teams and those things are sometimes a little bit more sore coming out of the practices, as opposed to some of the skill kids who had those, but I've been pleased.\" \nRELATED: AU's lone 300 pound defender, Jauntavius Johnson will fill gaps \nWilliams, a redshirt freshman, has appeared in all five games but has not recorded a stat. The former four-star recruit did take reps with the second-team defense in warm-ups prior to the San Jose State game.

(Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) \n\"They are very hard workers,\" linebacker Justin Garrett said of Johnson and Williams. \"Very explosive and powerful and willing to do whatever coach (Muschamp) says.\" \nRELATED: Muschamp: 'Hell, ain't nobody got to throw it' against Auburn \nJohnson and Williams will compete for reps against junior college transfers Devaroe Lawrence and Maurice Swain. Lawrence has nine tackle and Swain has four this season, though neither had a tackle against SJSU, which ran for 182 yards and two touchdowns on 38 carries. \n\"Last ballgame was not very good,\" Muschamp said. \"We need to improve.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:23:24.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
