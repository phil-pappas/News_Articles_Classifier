Watt after sacking Purdue quarterback David Blough for a 9-yard loss in the fourth quarter Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium. Purdue did not go over 100 yards of total offense until the fourth quarter. STEVE APPS -- State Journal \nUW's Alec Ingold scores on a 4-yard touchdown run against Purdue in the first quarter Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium. \nHaving dominated for 31/2 quarters, the University of Wisconsin football team’s defense didn’t want to leave anything to chance. \nRunning back Alec Ingold scored the game’s final points with 7 minutes, 16 seconds remaining in UW’s 24-7 victory over Purdue on Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium. \nIt was the type of score that sent fans toward the exits. For senior safety Michael Caputo and the defense, however, it made the next series all the more important. \n“At that point, we knew we had to come out and make a stop,” Caputo said. “It was a very pivotal moment. It’s good to keep the momentum on your side.” \nPurdue’s first play after the ensuing kickoff ended with UW inside linebacker T.J. Edwards punching the ball loose from running back Markell Jones — a fumble that safety Tanner McEvoy recovered for the Badgers. \nIt capped another impressive defensive effort in a season full of them and once again ensured UW (5-2 overall, 2-1 Big Ten Conference) wouldn’t need much from its inconsistent offense in order to win. \nPurdue (1-6, 0-3) managed just 191 total yards — 78 came on two meaningless drives after Edwards’ forced fumble. \n“I thought that was probably the best defense we’ve faced coming into the game on film,” Purdue coach Darrell Hazell said. “We’ve played some pretty good defenses at Michigan State and Virginia Tech, but I thought this one put as much pressure (on) teams as anybody.” \nThe only thing that kept UW from its third shutout of the season was a touchdown drive that began on the Badgers’ 29-yard line. \nQuarterback Joel Stave, who finished 30-for-39 passing for 322 yards, threw an errant pass in the red zone that Purdue safety Leroy Clark intercepted at the 5-yard line and returned 66 yards to the 29. \nEven with the short field, it took the Boilermakers nine plays and a fourth-down conversion to reach the end zone and tie the game at 7 with 12:44 left in the first half. \nThe Badgers reached the red zone on all four first-half possessions but only led 10-7 at the break. \n“We’ve just got to do a better job of executing when we’re down there,” Stave said. “I thought we did a great job moving the ball, a great job sustaining drives, converted a lot of first downs, but again, when we got down in the red zone, we didn’t come away with as many points as we needed to.” \nUW’s first two drives of the second half ended in punts from inside the Purdue 40-yard line, but the Boilermakers never threatened to take the lead. \nAlthough the Badgers only rushed for 96 yards on 37 carries (2.6 average), a pair of rushing touchdowns sealed the game. \nDare Ogunbowale’s 4-yard touchdown run on the final play of the third quarter extended UW’s lead to 17-7. \nOn the Badgers’ next possession, Ingold finished off an 11-play drive with his second touchdown of the game — a 1-yard score on fourth down in which he broke two tackles in the backfield and carried another defender into the end zone. \n“I think our consistency in the run game can hurt you,” UW coach Paul Chryst said. “And at the same time, boy, I thought Alec’s run and Dare’s touchdown — those two runs right there, it was not clean at all but great effort.” \nThrough seven games, it appears the return of Corey Clement (sports hernia) is the Badgers’ best and perhaps only chance to find the offensive production needed to win the Big Ten West. The running back dressed and warmed up but ultimately did not play. \nMeanwhile, the defense continues to do all it can to keep the Badgers’ hopes alive to repeat as division champions. \n“I’m very proud of how far we’ve come (as a defense) from the beginning of the season to now, and that’s with everybody from starters you see out there to the guys subbing in to what everyone calls second and third string,” Caputo said. “Everybody’s coming along and taking ownership of their role. \n“We’ve just got to keep playing. I think guys are becoming more comfortable with trying to be playmakers and doing their job that it’s very comfortable for me to know that I’m around a bunch of guys that just want to make plays and want to play football.” Jason Galloway \nJason Galloway covers University of Wisconsin football for the Wisconsin State Journal.
