Coach Mike Houston’s Citadel team is 4-2 overall and 3-0 in the SoCon with wins over perennial contender Wofford and the teams picked to finish second in the league by coaches (Samford) and media (Western Carolina). Fullback Isiaha Smith scored three touchdowns, and cornerback Dee Delaney scored a defensive TD and set up another score with his fifth interception of the season. The Citadel scored two touchdowns in the final minute of the first half to break the game open at 35-14, and led by 41-14 in the third quarter before easing off the gas. Quarterback Dominique Allen ran 29 times for 166 yards and a score, and The Citadel totaled 424 rushing yards while keeping Samford’s vaunted passing attack under wraps. The Citadel is tied atop the SoCon with Chattanooga (5-1, 3-0), which had to scrap Saturday for a 33-27 win over VMI. The Citadel has three games -- at Furman next week and home games with Mercer and VMI -- before what could be a huge showdown Nov. 14 at Chattanooga. Samford dropped to 3-3 overall and 1-2 in the league, and coach Chris Hatcher was forced to bench the SoCon’s top passer, Michael Eubank, in the second half. Backup quarterback Devlin Hodges hit Karel Hamilton for an 83-yard TD as Samford pulled to within 41-25 with 12:21 left in the game. And when Samford recovered an onside kick, it looked like The Citadel might be in trouble. But Delaney came through again, forcing a fumble recovered by Joe Crochet. That set up a 41-yard field goal by Eric Goins to make it 44-25 with 9:17 left. The Citadel turned in its best 30 minutes of the season in the first half, riding a 28-point outburst in the second quarter -- including two TDs in the final minute -- to a 35-14 lead at the break. Up 28-14 in the final mdinute of the half, Citadel defensive end Mark Thomas sacked Eubank, forcing a fumble that cornerback elaney picked up, racing 25 yards for a TD just 37 seconds before halftime. The Citadel executed the two-minute drill to perfection for a 28-14 lead, Allen hitting Vinny Miller for 28 yards and Cam Jackson throwing a halfback pass for 27 yards to Jorian Jordan. Smith scored the TD from one yard out with 56 seconds left in the half. Allen’s 42-yard run set up his own 1-yard TD for The Citadel’s first TD. After Eubank answered with a 32-yard touchdown run to tie the score at 7-7, Vinny Miller capped a 75-yard drive with an 8-yard TD burst to give The Citadel a 14-7 lead. Smith went 31 yards up the gut for a TD that made it 21-7 midway through the second quarter. A fake punt on fourth-and-9 and Eubank’s 32-yard pass to Karel Hamilton set up defensive tackle Michael Pierce’s 1-yard TD as Samford climbed back to within 28-14 with 3:39 left in the half.
