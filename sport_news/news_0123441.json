Charles went down without contact and immediately had to grab his knee. He was in obvious pain on the field, and was eventually helped up by trainers.\nHe couldn't put weight on the leg as he limped off the field with the help of the training staff and teammate Justin Houston. He was also helped to the locker room, again putting no weight on the injured leg. The Chiefs declared Charles out for the remainder of the game with a knee injury.\nThe immediate fear is that he suffered a torn ACL, according to Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network . There will be an MRI to confirm, but that fear is based on initial tests, according to the report. Charles sustained an ACL tear in the other knee in 2011, so he played in just two games that season.\nCharles had 12 carries for 58 yards and caught one pass for 26 yards before going down with the injury. He's Kansas City's starting running back and one of the best players on that team. Coming into the game, he had 59 carries for 306 yards and four touchdowns, and has rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of the past three seasons, and in two other seasons earlier in his career.\nCharcandrick West is the primary backup to Charles, with Knile Davis behind him on the depth chart. When Charles sustained the injury, West had two carries for 15 yards and Davis did not have a carry against the Bears.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/653291607744192512", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/chicago-bears", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/245859/jamaal-charles", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/kansas-city-chiefs", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:37:51.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
