ST. LOUIS — John Lackey outpitched former teammate Jon Lester, allowing two hits into the eighth inning, and rookies Tommy Pham and Stephen Piscotty each homered late as the St. Louis Cardinals cooled off the Chicago Cubs with a 4-0 victory Friday night in the opener of their NL Division Series.\n\"Tonight was special, for sure,\" Lackey said.\n\"The atmosphere was outstanding, the crowd was really into it, and I knew I’d have to pitch well.\"\nIn front of a standing-room-only crowd of 47,830 — the second-largest at 10-year-old Busch Stadium — thousands of Cubs faithful mixed into the red throng for the first postseason game between the two long-time rivals.\n\"Incredible. I thought his fastball was about as good as we’ve seen. Period,\" manager Mike Matheny said. \"Anything you wanted to do, he pretty much had it.\"\nLackey held the Cubs hitless for five innings, getting help from Kris Bryant’s double-play ball to end the fourth. Addison Russell ended the suspense with a solid single up the middle to open the sixth and Kyle Schwarber’s bunt hit leading off the seventh was the only other hit allowed by Lackey in 7 1/3 innings.\nGame 2 of the best-of-five series is today. The Cardinals turn to lefty Jaime Garcia (10-6), who made 20 starts coming off risky thoracic surgery. Kyle Hendricks (8-7) makes his postseason debut for the NL wild-card winners.\nMatt Holliday had an RBI single in the first, giving St. Louis a lead after just three at-bats. Pinch-hitting, Pham homered off Lester with one out in the eighth to snap a string of 13 straight outs for the lefty. Piscotty had a two-run shot off Pedro Strop in the eighth.\nThe 36-year-old Lackey outdid Lester, with whom he formed a potent 1-2 punch on the 2013 Red Sox, the team that knocked off the Cardinals in the World Series.\n\"Lester did his thing as well,\" Lackey said. \"A really fun game, and fun to be a part of.\"\nLackey is 3-0 with an 0.93 ERA in four starts against Chicago overall. Lester is 1-4, but he has a 2.79 ERA against St. Louis.\nIncluding their wild-card victory at Pittsburgh, the Cubs had won nine in a row.\nThey haven’t scored since the fifth inning of that 4-0 victory, however. Lester settled in for an impressive night after the first. Piscotty doubled with one out and scored on Holliday’s single. Lester struck out nine and gave up three runs on five hits in 7 1/3 innings.\n\"Lack made really one more pitch than I did,\" Lester said. \"I know obviously the grand total doesn’t show that, but that’s kind of the way I feel.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:33.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
