No. 22 Temple is making its first appearance since 1979. No. 19 Toledo and No. 21 Houston give the Top 25 a couple more representatives from conferences that aren't part of the Power Five.

Memphis has come from behind in each of its last five games. The only other time Memphis reached the Top 25 was in 2004.
