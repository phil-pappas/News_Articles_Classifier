For a team coming off a six-goal loss to the Florida Panthers on Saturday, with a rookie head coach in Dave Hakstol, this was hardly an encouraging sign. No one expects the Flyers to contend for a championship, but the thought that the players already needed time to sort out some problems - with Hakstol outside of earshot - hinted that the season might be even longer and harder than anticipated.\nSo after their morning skate at the Wells Fargo Center, every man downplayed the meeting's timing and importance. \"A team meeting is a talk,\" defenseman Mark Streit said. \"It wasn't an emergency meeting or anything like that. Sometimes it's early in the season, sometimes later. You never know.\" It was only after they'd dispersed for the afternoon, returning that night to beat the Panthers 1-0, that general manager Ron Hextall cut to the core of the team's real challenge. Maybe the meeting mattered, but the moment mattered more.\n\"Tonight,\" Hextall said, \"is critical.\"\nMore coverage Box score: Flyers 1, Panthers 0 VOTE: Will the Flyers make the playoffs?

Latest hockey odds To mark the third game of an 82-game season as vital might seem an overstatement. Not in this case. Not with this team. The Flyers were prone to falling into stretches of dispirited play last season, especially against equal or lesser opponents, and Monday morning both brought and promised a measure of upheaval heavy for this time of year.\nGoaltender Steve Mason missed the game because of what the team called \"a personal family matter\" - an issue so serious and sensitive that not only did neither Hextall nor Hakstol comment on it, but Hextall took the unusual step of asking those people operating television cameras not to record or broadcast his minimal remarks. Chairman Ed Snider, who revealed last year that he had cancer, didn't attend the game, either, remaining at his California home, \"resting and recharging after recent medical therapy,\" according to a Comcast-Spectacor statement.\nAll of those graver developments made it easy to forget what is ahead for the Flyers: a game Wednesday against the Chicago Blackhawks - the reigning Stanley Cup champions - and a six-day layoff. So a loss Monday could have taken one rough night in Fort Lauderdale and fast-tracked it into a full-fledged slump, one that the team would have had close to a week to stew over. If nothing else, the players-only gathering after that 7-1 rout Saturday reminded everyone what was at stake.\n\"A lot of things happen in a season, and I think the main focus was to make sure everybody stays together and stays tight,\" said team captain Claude Giroux, who had called the meeting. \"One reason I did that meeting was because of our past. We had a couple of losses [last season] where we'd get off track, and it would change the whole mind-set of the game. I think the whole thing was to just get everybody to relax and not hit the panic button right away. Guys came to the rink [Monday] ready to play.\"\nThey were much better than they'd been two nights before. They couldn't have been worse, really. Hakstol's teams at North Dakota treaded a thin line for their success, combining a sound checking system with edgy physical play, and the Flyers wobbled across that high wire Monday. They gave the Panthers six power plays, including a four-minute advantage on a Michael Raffl high stick just 77 seconds into the game. But they killed off all six, and Brayden Schenn rammed home a rebound not long after Raffl left the penalty box.\nIn Mason's stead, Michal Neuvirth made 31 saves, and the care that Giroux and his teammates had taken to make certain their season didn't spiral out of control appeared for one night to be a prudent decision.\n\"It doesn't matter that it was two games in or 20 games in,\" Hextall said. \"I would expect that. That's leadership. Think about it. We got beat 7-1. No matter how it happened, a group meeting there is a good thing. And it's not really a meeting. It's more, you close the door and talk after a game. You win a big game, and sometimes guys speak up. It's no different.\"\nAnd this was a big game for the Flyers, for a host of reasons. Three games in, a first-year coach - the questions could have started snowballing, like they often do around here. A little calm now, even this early, even if it took the sounding of sirens to achieve it, is nothing but good.\nmsielski@phillynews.com\n@MikeSielski", "external_links": ["http://philly.stats.com/nhl/boxscore.asp?gamecode=2015101215&home=15&vis=26&final=true", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNHL_Philadelphia_Flyers"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:44:00.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
