In addition, WR officials said that the Railway Board had sanctioned a plan to install electronic surveillance system (CCTV) inside 50 more ladies coaches. This would translate into around 17 rakes, said WR officials.\nThe work will be undertaken in EMU Workshop, Mahalaxmi and will be completed within a year, said a WR statement. Officials said the cameras have all been customised for use in the railway and are based on traction technology that can withstand shock and vibrations as trains often clock 80-100 kmph on the suburban section.\n\"The three suburban rakes have three ladies coaches each, making it a total of nine coaches. About four to eight surveillance cameras, with a 3 megapixel resolution, have been installed in each ladies coach to provide maximum coverage. The system records the data in a digital video recorder, which has sufficient capacity to store the data for 30 days. It can be used by investigating agencies if required,\" said an official.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:09:49.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
