The fans and media seem to have given up on the national football team due to the abysmal results at the international stage for... for, well, almost a lifetime. India last won an Asian Games medal (a bronze) in football way back in 1970. There have been a few more achievements since then, but they’re of a localised and minor nature. We’re ranked in the 160s in the world. In the Club vs Country debate over Indian football, Club seems to be winning the battle for the fans’ attention. The Indian Super League tournament, peopled with a few faded stars of the international stage, apart from India’s best, is the shiny new league that is pulling in the fans into the stadiums. The ISL’s promotion has been given a fillip by Pele’s presence. Over the last few days, we’ve seen Pele vigorously exercising his arms and hands a lot, at the airport and his hotel and the stadium in Kolkata, waving to the hysterical fans of the city. Cricketers, footballers, celebrities, reporters, millionaire patrons of sport, and a chief minister have fawned over him over the last few days. In the mindspace of the fans and media, a Pele-sized space needed to be made, and ISL needed to be prioritised over the Indian national team. Thus, since the ISL is on, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) could not organise a preparatory camp for the national footballers before they departed for the games against Turkmenistan and Oman, played on October 8 and 13. The ISL had started on October 3; the AIFF was unable and unwilling to persuade the ISL teams to release the national players early to prepare for their international assignments. It can be argued that prioritising club football over the national team was inevitable in an effort to bring a sense of hope to the sport in India; India’s international campaigns in football have been completely forlorn affairs. Indian football has been nothing but a repository of bad news for decades. The status quo of Indian football has been the status quo of mediocrity and, let’s say this, ineptitude. Pele, a month short of 75, can’t do anything for Indian football; he can only excite a few hundred fans who have the privileged access to him. But maybe some good will come out of the media tamasha, maybe more kids will take up football. And perhaps the ISL will stir things up; perhaps more kids will start playing football seriously. Perhaps football in India will be revived, hopefully as a recreational sport that the youngsters would like to play. And let’s forget international rankings and international humiliations — we need to play sport for reasons other than winning at the international stage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:35:56.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
