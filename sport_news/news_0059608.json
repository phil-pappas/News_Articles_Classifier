According to Cambridge Dictionaries Online , advocate means, “to publicly support or suggest and idea, development or way of doing something.”\nAs a parent, I became the advocate for the safety and needs of that child. Those factors were a daily priority.\nAs a volunteer for local non-profit organizations in the community, advocacy fell under numerous categories. There were in house activities, fundraising and educational opportunities.\nAs a nursing student, a registered nurse working in hospital settings and becoming a nurse educator, more opportunities for advocacy were available.\nCo-founding a now-profit organization has had an even broader horizon for advocating. This organization has offered the chance to combine all the advocacy experiences. Health and wellness programming is continually developing while allowing the ability to create outstanding experiential learning in an outdoor classroom.\nMy nursing career began the day I became a nursing student. Today, I would like to take a look at what the nursing profession has provided. First I would like to say THANK YOU to all of my professors, they provided an outstanding education.\nFrom the moment of the nursing pinning ceremony, the nursing pledge (a modification of the Hippocratic Oath) and the lighted candles during the ceremony will always remain with me. The nursing pledge was called the “ Florence Nightingale Pledge as a token of esteem for the founder of modern nursing.”\nFlorence Nightingale was called “the lady with the lamp.” When looking back into history, we will find that Florence Nightingale showed how light became a “beacon of hope” for patients and the nursing profession.\nCarrying the Olympic Torch in 1996, I was reminded of the flame that I carry in my heart “to practice my profession faithfully.\" ~~ Florence Nightingale Pledge\nBe a messenger of HOPE and let’s challenge all Nurses to Unite and Display a Light of Hope. Join the LIGHTFEST Re-ignited movement to shine light on issues faced by those living in poverty and bring hope to the impoverished by showing them the world cares.\n\"Brighten impoverished lives by displaying a Light of Hope wherever you are on November 7, 2015 at 6pm Eastern Time, It can be a porch light, candle, cell phone, or flashlight. Join others around the world in celebrating the LIGHTFEST Re-Ignited movement!\"\nSharon Cecil, RN", "external_links": ["http://www.nursingworld.org/FunctionalMenuCategories/AboutANA/WhereWeComeFrom/FlorenceNightingalePledge.aspx", "http://lightfestreignited.info/"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:07:57.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
