Henry Reimann, Hillsboro police spokesman.\nBefore police arrived, Arellano-Sanchez was transported to OHSU Hospital where he later told police that he was riding his bicycle in the area of Walnut Street Park when a car pulled up alongside him.\nRiemann said there was an exchange of hand signs and words between Arrellano-Sanchez and three men in the car. One of the men allegedly exited the car and started to fight with Arellano. A second man got out of the car and came at Arellano-Sanchez from behind, allegedly stabbing him multiple times.\nReimann said Arellano-Sanchez apparently knew one of the attackers, but refused to identify him.\nThe case is under investigation by the Washington County Inter-agency Gang Enforcement Team.\n-- Stuart Tomlinson\nstomlinson@oregonian.com\n503-221-8313\n@ORweather", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d11182.476139544184!2d-122.9653435!3d45.5177471!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x35334bf14c39ff11!2sWalnut+Street+Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1443629844872", "https://twitter.com/ORweather"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:20:07.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
