Young, Detroit News) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Matt Charboneau breaks down Saturday's Michigan State-Purdue game at Spartan Stadium (noon, WJR/ESPN2)\nBoilermakers to watch \nDavid Blough, QB: The redshirt freshman made his first career start last week in a loss to Bowling Green and was one of the bright spots for Purdue. He was 29-for-39 for 340 yards and two TDs, and added a rushing TD. He became the first Purdue freshman to pass for 300 yards since Danny Etling (485 vs. Washington State, 2001 Sun Bowl). Blough helped spark the Boilermakers offense that ranks third in the Big Ten in passing (257.2 yards).\nDanny Anthrop, WR: The senior was having an outstanding junior season before tearing the ACL in his right knee Nov. 1. He is slowly working his way back but still leads the Boilermakers with 16 catches for 124 yards and one TD. He likely will be a favorite target of David Blough. Anthrop has a history of playing well against Michigan State, catching nine passes for 133 yards last season.\nJa’Whaun Bentley, LB: The sophomore was voted a team captain, the first sophomore to earn that honor since Raheem Mostert in 2012. Bentley is the top returning tackler (76) from last season, including 3.5 for loss, three fumble recoveries and an INT. He had 10 tackles against Marshall and followed that with 11 tackles, including three for loss, against Virginia Tech. In last week’s loss to Bowling Green, Bentley had a career-high 14 tackles, giving him 40 overall.\nIntangibles \nMoving up: Purdue has had trouble getting out of the cellar of the Big Ten West, and at 1-3, confidence isn’t high it will change. But the Boilermakers have played the Spartans tough, pulling within a TD in the fourth quarter last season and staying close in a 14-0 loss in 2013.\nToo high? Michigan State has heard some outside the program say it isn’t deserving of its No. 2 ranking, and while the Spartans insist it doesn’t affect them, they admitted last weekend they must start playing like the No. 2 team. That means no emotional lulls, quick starts to each half and shoring up the pass defense.\nConnections: Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio was a graduate assistant at Purdue in 1981, and Michigan State WR coach Terrence Samuel played at Purdue from 1991-94. The connections won’t be at the forefront for either coach today, but it could add an extra layer of satisfaction following a victory.\nOpposing teammates: Purdue sophomore LB Ja’Whaun Bentley and Michigan State fifth-year senior LB Darien Harris attended DeMatha High in Maryland, one of several high school connections. Purdue redshirt freshman S Tim Cason was a teammate with Michigan State redshirt freshman OL David Beedle and true freshman OL Cole Chewins at Clarkston High; Purdue sophomore DE Antoine Miles and Michigan State junior CB Jermaine Edmondson attended McKinley High in Canton, Ohio\nWelcome home: Michigan State is playing its 100th homecoming game, and coach Mark Dantonio is 7-1. Michigan State has played Purdue three times on homecoming, winning in 1966 and 1974 and losing in 1954. The Spartans have outscored homecoming opponents 266-149 under Dantonio.\nFacts and figures \n*Michigan State QB Connor Cook is 27-3 in his career as a starter and a victory today would move him past Kirk Cousins into first place in school history. His 27 wins are tied for most by an active FBS quarterback, matching Stanford’s Kevin Hogan, while his .900 winning percentage ranks first.\n*Michigan State has won six straight in the series and Mark Dantonio is 6-0 against Purdue. The last win in the series for Purdue came in 2006 (17-15 in East Lansing).\n*The Spartans enter Saturday’s game eighth in the nation in turnover margin (plus-1.5) after ranking second in 2014. The have forced eight takeaways and have turned the ball over twice. And while they have scored 27 off forced turnovers, the Spartans have not allowed a point on their turnovers allowed.\n*Shilique Calhoun matched his career-high with 2.5 sacks last week and is sixth on Michigan State’s career list with 21 career sacks. He also has 34 career tackles for loss, which ranks him ninth in Spartans history.\n*The last time Purdue faced a Michigan State team ranked in the top five was 1999. Purdue won 52-28. Saturday’s matchup is Purdue’s first against a team ranked in the top two in the AP poll since Oct. 23, 1999, a 31-25 loss to Penn State. Purdue has not faced a top-two team on the road since 1990, when it lost at No. 1 Notre Dame, 37-11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:32:47.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
