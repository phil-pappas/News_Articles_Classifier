Continuity will again be the Grizzlies’ best friend. But there always are loose strings and I’ll attempt to tie those together in this space from time to time.

If Green leaves, it’ll probably be his decision based on not feeling like he can flourish in Memphis. Lee is a different story due to a couple of factors. The Griz may not want to reach his asking price given salaries for mid-level players will skyrocket based on the influx of billions from the NBA’s new television deal. Lee has proven to be a proficient shooter despite his unwillingness to put up shots at times in Memphis. Also, the Griz will also consider whether Jordan Adams is ready to assume the position based on how he progresses this season. Lee’s return is a tricky one because the Griz are in win-now mode but must have one eye on the future.\n@CAGrizBeat will Ryan Hollins make the team?\n— Shy (@FoxxyShyD) October 14, 2015\nI don’t have a great read on this one except to repeat that I’d be a bit surprised if he did. Why? Because Hollins’ path to a roster spot means that the Griz would likely cut ties with second-year forward Jarnell Stokes. Although the Griz only have Marc Gasol a true center on the roster, cutting Stokes and his guaranteed contract wouldn’t make sense at this point. Hollins has been a real pro in camp but he doesn’t move the needle for a team trying to contend for a title. My thinking is that you deal with the center spot only IF Gasol goes down.\n@CAGrizBeat Is there a worse shooting SF rotation in the Division than the Grizzlies #GrizzMail\n— Must-See DC (@_yepisaidit_) October 11, 2015\nHa! Jeff Green is having an indifferent training camp. Matt Barnes is 0 for 9 from 3-point range during the preseason. Vince Carter is 38 years old. Tony Allen can defend the position but clearly isn’t a perimeter threat. Good question. People mock this but the Griz will be happy if Green can at least be as good as Rudy Gay, who has a skill set that is greatly missed.\nAny word on why Jamychal Green hasn't played? @CAGrizBeat\n— Anthony Sain (@SainAsylum) October 13, 2015\nGriz coach Dave Joerger said the reasons Green didn’t play against Cleveland at The Ohio State University earlier this week were because of a sore elbow and Joerger wanted to experiment with a small lineup. The Griz are still encouraged by what the combination of JaMychal Green and Brandan Wright will mean in terms of athleticism on the second unit.\n@CAGrizBeat Any news on Beno ankle?\n— Richard (@Richard9112) October 13, 2015\nUdrih sat out the open practice on Tuesday. He says his ankle is a little swollen. But Udrih also says that he’s not experiencing the amount of pain that he suffered during the 2015 playoffs. However, the sprain is on the same right ankle that required off-season surgery.\n@CAGrizBeat hey where's Andrew Harrison? Thanks\n— Josh Tucker (@tucdaddy) October 11, 2015\nHarrison has actually been in Memphis working out with the coaching staff since training camp began. He won’t be on the Grizzlies’ roster this season but the team owns his rights. Harrison is expected to play with the Grizzlies’ NBA Development League affiliate, Iowa Energy. Simply put: Russ Smith took the third-string point guard spot with his impressive play at summer league. By comparison, Harrison was underwhelming.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/GrizzMail?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/FoxxyShyD/status/654402364158386177", "https://twitter.com/tucdaddy/status/653173937363361792", "https://twitter.com/Richard9112/status/653737103805714433", "http://www.twitter.com/CAGrizBeat", "https://twitter.com/austinperson/status/654405656368312320", "https://twitter.com/_yepisaidit_/status/653314704765534212", "https://twitter.com/SainAsylum/status/653742166418722816", "https://twitter.com/CAGrizBeat"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:38:11.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
