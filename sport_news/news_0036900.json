It was just a freak accident, with Brown twisting at the last second and LeGrand's head crashing into the returner's shoulder blade. \nThe violent collision left both players prone on the turf. Brown, who broke his collarbone on the play, was able to get up and run to Army's sideline. LeGrand remained motionless on the field. \nWhen LeGrand was carted off the field a few minutes later, it was obvious he had suffered a significant injury. Those fears were confirmed when LeGrand was diagnosed with a spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the neck down. \nA first lieutenant in the Army's 2nd brigade, 1st cavalry division, Brown is currently stationed in South Korea. The Bay Shore, N.Y., native spoke to NJ Advance Media this week about the impact the play has had on his life. \n\"It seems like it was yesterday that the hit occurred. The hit is always going to remain in my mind at all times,\" said Brown, 25. \"I was in denial for probably a good month. It almost felt like it was my fault just because he hit me and he's the one that got the worst of it. So at that point, I felt like the blame was on me. I was just questioning how did this happen and 'Oh, it could have been me' type of thing, or it should have been me, honestly. I just always have that in my mind where it's like, 'I don't know why that happened? What was God's plan for this?' \" \nRELATED: Inside a therapy session with Eric LeGrand five years after his injury \nBrown's guilt has subsided thanks to the relationship he has formed with LeGrand, who never assigned any blame for his injury. \n\"I was the one who made the tackle on him,\" LeGrand said this week, echoing the message he delivered to Brown when they first met in the summer of 2011. \"He didn't do anything wrong. There's no way I was going to blame something like that on him.\" \nAnd after watching LeGrand inspire so many through his enduring belief that he'll walk again, Brown no longer questions why the play occurred. \n\"Now I see that he's so positive and it makes me feel a lot better,\" Brown said. \"Obviously we see now that he's been able to touch more lives just through all of his motivating people to get better and not just to lay down and accept defeat.\" \nPLUS : Former Rutgers coach Greg Schiano on Eric LeGrand today: 'He's a miracle' \nTHE PLAY \nArmy had schemed to double-team LeGrand, a 270-pound force on special teams. But the plan went awry on a kickoff return after Rutgers scored the tying touchdown with 5:16 left in the game. \nBrown fielded the kickoff near the right sideline and turned upfield. LeGrand had beaten his blockers and was coming full-speed at Brown. Just before they collided, Rutgers defensive back Wayne Warren got a piece of Brown's leg, causing the returner's body to twist to the side. In an instant, LeGrand's head made contact with Brown's shoulder blade, which hadn't been the intended target. \n\"I remember I took the kickoff return and I was heading down and I saw that he was free,\" Brown said. \"At the last second I saw him and I ended up turning my shoulder a little bit and then I just remember I got hit to the ground and he was on the ground pretty much laying right next to me. I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder so I got up and ran to the sideline and I remember seeing his body was kind of stiff. I knew at that point that it wasn't a good hit. I knew something was wrong at that point.\" \nAs medical staff rushed onto the field to attend to LeGrand, Brown retreated to the Army sideline where he was evaluated by trainers. He didn't realize he had broken his collarbone until the adrenaline wore off a few minutes later. \n\"We were on a knee for a very long time,\" Brown said. \"My trainers were checking me out as I was looking on at the scene hoping and praying that Eric LeGrand — actually I didn't know it was Eric LeGrand at the time — but I was hoping that the Rutgers player would be fine and he wouldn't actually be injured severely. You could see his body, that it didn't look good at the time.\" \nBrown didn't learn the extent of LeGrand's injury until the next day when Army trainer Tim Kelly provided an update. \n\"At that moment when T.K. told me, I knew it wasn't good because he told me about what they thought was wrong with (LeGrand) and that he had been in surgery pretty much ever since the accident,\" Brown said. \"At that moment, it really hit me and I just started praying that hopefully he'd be better and he'd be able to walk away from this with no pain.\" \nBrown's injury caused him to miss the next four games before he returned for the regular season finale against rival Navy. He scored both of Army's touchdowns in a 31-17 loss to the Midshipmen. \nBrown went on to rush for a combined 1,013 yards (averaging 7.1 yards per carry) in his final two seasons at Army. But thoughts of the play, which he has only watched a handful of times over the past five years, stayed with him. \n\"It was difficult. That was always in the back of my head,\" Brown said. \"After that, I never returned a kick ever again. Not out of fear, but my coaches didn't want me to do it. I don't know. It was hard for me to get out there and kick return again. It really was.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:52:50.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
