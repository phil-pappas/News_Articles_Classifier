PETERSBURG, Fla. â€” Troy Tulowitzki is listed in the Toronto Blue Jays' starting lineup for their game against the Tampa Bay Rays.\nTulowitzki hasn't played since Sept. 12, when he cracked his scapula and bruised muscles in his upper back after colliding with teammate Kevin Pillar in a game against the New York Yankees. He is scheduled to bat seventh in Friday's game.\nHe had a homer, two doubles and walked once in six plate appearances of a simulated game against a pair of minor league pitchers before the AL East champions started a regular season-ending, three-game series against the Rays.\nDavid Price, scheduled to pitch Game 1 of the AL Division series Thursday, also took part in the simulated game and struck out Tulowitzki on a called third strike and got a fly ball to center.\nToronto obtained Tulowitzki from Colorado on July 28 in a multi-player deal. He's is hitting .232 with the Blue Jays, but they're 30-8 with him in the starting lineup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:40:06.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
