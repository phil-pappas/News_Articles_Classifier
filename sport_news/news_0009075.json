If I scribbled about all the key plays in this game, I'd run out of ink. But one big series really sticks with me. It was near the end of regulation. There was 1:53 left in the fourth quarter, Denver with a 23-20 lead. Offensive coordinator John DeFilippo has done a very good this season, but he looked like a rookie play-caller at this point in the game.\n2. The Browns had the ball on the Denver 11-yard-line. DeFilippo's first call was a short pass to rookie fullback Malcolm Johnson. Confession time: That surprised me. Hey, I never expected a pass to the fullback in that spot. Just writing \"a pass to the fullback in the red zone\" sounds like a bad idea. It didn't fool Denver, as Johnson caught the ball and was blasted for no gain.\n3. On the next play, the Browns handed off to Isaiah Crowell for a 3-yard gain. On third down on the Denver 8, they threw a short incomplete pass to Brian Hartline. Never once in three plays did they take a shot at the end zone. Was it because they didn't want to risk Josh McCown throwing an interception? I don't know. Travis Coon kicked a 26-yard field goal to tie the game at 23-23. But a touchdown could have put the Browns in position to win.\nBrownsâ€™ Josh McCown on his two interceptions in loss to Broncos Cleveland Browns quarterback Josh McCown talks about his two interceptions in the 26-23 loss in overtime to the Denver Broncos at FirstEnergy Stadium. His first interception was a pick-six. The second, at the end of regulation, ended the chance to win then. Sunday, Oct 18, 2015. Dave Andersen, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n4. Gary Barnidge had already caught two TD passes. Maybe he would have been covered. But the tight end has a knack of getting open near the goal line. He has caught TD passes in each of the last four games. Or they could have thrown to Travis Benjamin or someone else.\n5. I wanted the Browns to go for the win at that point because I didn't want to face Peyton Manning in an overtime period. Yes, he's a creaky, 39-year-old Peyton Manning. But Manning is used to winning games like this. The Browns have a long history of losing games like this. Why be so conservative and give Denver a chance to win in overtime?\n6. Maybe something bad would have happened if McCown threw into the end zone. The Browns actually got the ball back with 66 seconds left in the fourth quarter and drove to the Denver 46. Then McCown threw to Barnidge, and the ball was picked off.\n7. I admit, the pass to the fullback followed by two plays with nearly zero chance to reach the end zone shocked me.\n8. Meanwhile, the Browns defense had one of its better games. They picked off three Manning passes. The veteran was 26-of-48 passing for a poor 53.3 rating. But he led Denver on that final 13-play, 72-yard drive to set up the game-winning field goal. The Browns defense looked empty in the overtime period, as if they sensed a loss was coming.\n9. Once again, they were run over in the rushing game. Denver piled up 152 yards on the ground, a 4.6 average. So far this season, the Browns have allowed these numbers when trying to defend the run: 152-181-91-155-166-154. Other than the San Diego game (91 yards), teams run for 150 yards against the Browns. It doesn't matter if they have good running back, or just guys who run the ball. Denver entered the game ranked No. 30 in rushing. You'd never have guessed it.\n10. Travis Benjamin had a superb game receiving with nine catches. He often was tightly covered and hit hard, but hung on to the ball. Benjamin and Barnidge have combined for nine touchdown catches between them. Barnidge leads with five. A year ago, Benjamin had the most on the team with three. So the Browns are developing real threats in their wide receiver and tight end.\n11. Robert Turbin made his Browns debut with 27 yards rushing in 10 carries. Rather modest numbers, but you can see that Turbin does have the ability to pick up a couple of tough inside yards once he gets fully back into playing condition. He has been out all season with a high ankle sprain.\n12. Denver came into the game not having allowed a point in the first quarter this season. The Browns didn't change that. So it's now six games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:01:14.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
