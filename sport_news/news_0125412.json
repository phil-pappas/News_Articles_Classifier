Huh) By Staff \nThe ball hit by Middletown High School graduate Kyle Schwarber for a monstrous home run in the Cubs’ series-clinching win over the Cardinals on Tuesday landed on top of the right field video board at Wrigley Field and won’t be going anywhere soon. After retrieving and authenticating it, the Cubs returned the ball and said they will leave it there until their postseason run has concluded. The Cubs said a plexiglass case has been built to preserve the ball from the elements and that security will escort anyone going up to the top of the video board to service it so it won’t be stolen.
