After spending the last three years with Rams head coach Jeff Fisher and offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti, Davis is Cleveland’s foremost expert on what makes St. Louis tick. Fisher, one of the most experienced head coaches in the NFL, let Davis go in September. On Wednesday, Fisher was in a position to tell Browns fans a bit about Davis, who is telling the Browns everything he knows about Fisher. For Cleveland purposes, Davis is the guy who could leap into the spotlight if things go wrong with Josh McCown and Johnny Manziel. Around the league, Davis is known as the kid who came out of the blue to beat Seattle last year. Fisher spent the 2012-14 seasons coaching Davis, who now is signed through 2017 with Cleveland. “After we got him as a college free agent, he worked and worked and worked,” Fisher said in a Wednesday conversation with Ohio writers. “He was not a 9-to-5 guy. He was so committed to spending the extra time to making himself good. “He got an opportunity last year when (Sam Bradford and Shaun Hill) went down. He put together some good games and won some tough games. He beat the 49ers on the road, which is hard to do.” Davis went 3-5 in eight 2014 starts. In a 28-25 home win over eventual NFC champ Seattle, he posted a 132.3 passer rating. After a 6-10 season, the Rams cut ties with Bradford and brought in Nick Foles as the starter. Sean Mannion, a 6-foot-6 Oregon State alum in the Derek Anderson mold, was drafted in the third round. “We traded for Case (Keenum) early in the offseason and gave Austin a chance to compete for the third spot,” Fisher said. “He took every advantage. He was a great team player who understands offense. The fact that we drafted Sean … we had to make a hard decision, and we did so. “There was no doubt in my mind Austin was going to land someplace, just because he’s that type of competitor. He picks things up really fast.” Davis might be the most valuable man in Berea this week. “I’m sure he’s been debriefed the last couple of days regarding our offense and our defense,” Fisher said. McCown will make his fifth straight start for the Browns, with Manziel going through an off-field flap, and Davis waiting in the wings. Manziel and Davis are on the back burner for now, and McCown is front and center in trying to save the Browns season. The record will be 2-5 or 3-4 afterward. Page 2 of 2 - “You’re right,” McCown said to a question about urgency. “There’s a huge difference in that. “At the same time, you can’t let that be suffocating, to where you grip the ball too tight and you’re thinking, ’We gotta get to 3-4.’ “You’ve got to find a balance.“ McCown has a good idea feel for the Rams. As a Chicago Bear in 2013, in a 42-21 loss at St. Louis, McCown went 36-of-47 for 352 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception. As a Tampa Bay Buccaneer in 2014, in a 19-17 loss, McCown went 16-of-21 for 179 yards, taking four sacks and throwing an interception. This is the second year in a row he will be going against Gregg Williams, the coordinator Fisher hired in 2014. Fisher was a Bears defensive back in 1985 on a fabled defense that won a Super Bowl. “Jeff Fisher,“ McCown said, “is a heck of a coach, in my opinion.“ McCown admits it is handy to have Austin Davis picking Fisher’s brain from afar. “He knows the ins and outs of what they do,“ McCown said. “Austin will obviously be helpful.“ Reach Steve at 330-580-8347 or steve.doerschuk @cantonrep.com On Twitter: @sdoerschukREP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:11:11.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
