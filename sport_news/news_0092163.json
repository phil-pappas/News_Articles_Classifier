The Australian said he will miss the 37-year-old’s “like it or lump it” style of approaching the game. Sehwag on Tuesday announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket and Indian Premier League (IPL) with immediate effect. “Sehwag is amongst the most entertaining batsman I have ever seen. It has been many hours of pleasure watching Sehwag batting. He is a player of great mental strength. He just listens to you and then goes to the field the way he wants. And to be so successful in it was amazing,” Chappell was Quote: d as saying in a cricket website. “The specialty about him was he said ‘This is the way I play, you can say what you like about it but this is how I play. This suits me best.’ There are not many guys who are mentally strong like him,” he said. It was in Tests that Sehwag went on to establish himself as one of the very best in the game. He is still the only Indian to score a triple century, having done so twice against Pakistan (309 in Multan) and South Africa (319 in Chennai). When asked if Sehwag should have changed his style of playing and approach during the latter part of his career, the 72-year-old said: “I think players need to change their approach as they get into the latter part of the career. But Sehwag is different. He says this is not the way I play. He plays by his own style.” “Quite a few say this, but not many have become what Sehwag has achieved. He might have prolonged his career, but he might not have been Sehwag. I like it that he said, this is how I play, take it or leave it,” he said. Chappell also shared an incident when then India chief coach John Wright told Sehwag to be cautious while playing shots and Sehwag replied to it with just a smile. “I remember I met John Wright during his coaching in India. He told me that he asked Sehwag to be a bit cautious after the latter got out off a bad stroke. When I asked John what was Sehwag’s reply, John said Sehwag just smiled and did not reply. I am going to miss Sehwag, as I really enjoyed his batting,” said Chappell. —IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:14:30.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
