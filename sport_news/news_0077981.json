They don’t have anyone who has won, or even has come close to winning, the Rocket Richard or Art Ross Trophies. Not likely to anytime soon, either.\nAnd through three games this season, they’ve been, to put it kindly and mildly, imperfect.\nAnd yet …\nAnd yet.\nAnd yet the Blueshirts are a perfect 3-0 following Saturday’s Garden-opening 5-2 triumph over the Blue Jackets that completed their daunting three-games-in-four-nights getaway that began with victories in Chicago on Wednesday and in Columbus on Friday.\nThe question is, how? The question is, why?\nHow and why has this team won so often the last two years, even on nights when the final score seems an optical illusion?\nOther than Henrik Lundqvist, that is.\nLet’s let the King himself, brilliant in this one with 37 saves that included a bushel of tumbling acrobatic stops and another bushel of point-blank and rebound stops while the Rangers were as lax as could be in their own end, explain it.\n“This is a tight group now, and that helps so much,” Lundqvist told The Post. “We have been through so much together during the last couple of playoffs, and that means something when we have adversity.”\nThey’ve been through 76 playoff games since 2012 and 44 in the two tournaments for which Alain Vigneault has been behind the bench. They have played seven Games 7 the last four playoffs, and four under Vigneault. Their best nine players — Lundqvist, Ryan McDonagh, Dan Girardi, Marc Staal, Rick Nash, Derek Stepan, Derick Brassard, Chris Kreider and Mats Zuccarello — have been together since the 2013 trade deadline.\n“We have so much trust in each other,” Lundqvist said. “And we have so much trust and belief in the system.\n“The core group from last year is helping the new guys and together I think we understand what needs to be done early on,” said the steely goaltender (or is that stealy?). “When AV came in, we changed so much, but now everybody knows it and believes in it, so even if we are not at our best, the system will help out.”\nThe system helps out and so does a team-wide awareness of who they are. Former coach John Tortorella preached the importance of players being able to honestly self-evaluate their own play. This group does.\n“We have very high standards,” Marc Staal said. “When we had our meeting Friday morning, it wasn’t full of high-fiving, I can tell you that.\n“We’re honest with ourselves.”\nHonestly, there is much room for the Rangers to improve even at 3-0. After seizing a 3-0 lead within the opening 5:48 Saturday — after scoring three in the final 2:36 on Friday — the Blueshirts stopped playing attention to detail and started playing pond hockey.\nOn this night, the system was named Lundqvist.\nBut at the same time, 3-0 is no lie. And it is no tiny feat given the challenging schedule right out of the gate. Vigneault wanted a quick start. Pointed to it as far back as last June in his exit meeting with Lundqvist when he told the goaltender he needed a better start.\nThe proof of the system will come in next June’s pudding, for the objective is to go where no Ranger team has gone for 21 years — to the Canyon of Heroes. It is the only objective.\n“Sometimes you need the system to save you,” Lundqvist said. “We know what to do and take advantage of that.\n“Did we play our best? No,” he asked and answered. “But we didn’t get hurt because we know and stick to our system.”\n“You want to know the strength of our team? That’s our strength.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under alain vigneault ,  henrik lundqvist ,  new york rangers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:11:12.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
