And in many ways it’s Manning who’s been the difference between the two teams over the past decade, with the Giants winning a pair of Super Bowls and the Eagles still looking for their first championship since 1960.\nNow, with Manning coming off one of the best performances of his career in Sunday night’s dramatic comeback win over San Francisco, he once again leads the first-place Giants on the 90-mile trek down the turnpike.\nHere’s a look at Manning’s previous 10 starts in the City of Brotherly Love:\nOct. 12, 2014: Eagles 27, Giants 0 – Receiver Victor Cruz suffered a torn a patella tendon in his knee and has yet to return to the field. On plus side, it was the first game of Odell Beckham Jr.’s career and he caught his first TD pass. Overall, though, Manning simply couldn’t get anything going, getting sacked six times.\nOct. 27, 2013: Giants 15, Eagles 7 - Manning had a big advantage in this one, as quarterback Michael Vick tried to play for the Eagles but clearly wasn’t healthy. And when Matt Barkley entered the game for Vick he immediately fumbled the ball away. Manning threw for 246 yards, but the Giants only improved to 2-6.\nSept. 30, 2012: Eagles 19, Giants 17 – Throwing for 309 yards, Manning drove the Giants downfield in the fourth quarter, throwing a TD pass that put them up 17-16, and had them in position to win after the Eagles got a go-ahead field goal. But Lawrence Tyne’s 51-yard field goal try came up short with 15 seconds left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:22:43.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
