Join the Conversation Matthew Stevens , Montgomery Advertiser 9:25 p.m. CDT October 8, 2015 \nByron Cowart (Photo: File) \nAUBURN – Will Muschamp again expressed his displeasure with Auburn’s defense but the tone of Tigers defensive coordinator changed dramatically when referring to freshman Byron Cowart . \nMuschamp smiled and was happy knowing he’s seen exactly what Cowart is experiencing right now and it’s more than natural. In fact, in Muschamp’s mind, it’s actually expected. \nCowart, who some online recruiting services had ranked as the No. 1 prospect in the 2015 recruiting class, is going through something he’s likely never consistently felt on a football field – failure. \n“He is playing defensive line in the Southeastern Conference at a high level and will continue to improve and continue to get better,” Muschamp said Wednesday. “Just like every other freshman I've ever coached that played as a freshman in the Southeastern Conference. There's been a bunch and he certainly is going to be a guy who is going to play at a high level.” \nA perfect recent example of Muschamp’s slow development of highly touted freshman would how he handled Dante Fowler Jr. , in his freshman season at Florida in 2012. The five-star defensive end played the BUCK position for Muschamp as a true freshman and recorded just eight tackles, one quarterback hurry and no sacks in his first five games with the Gators. In his 32 career games at Florida, Fowler Jr., had 14.5 sacks, 32 tackles for loss and 24 quarterback hurries in route to being the No. 3 overall pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2015 NFL Draft. \n“Sometimes that I think a guy who is very hard on himself as a player certainly has high expectations for himself as any person would, whether it's in football or the business world or anything,” Muschamp said. “Especially in this day and age, it's the instant coffee society. Add water, put it in the microwave…and it's all going to work. That's really not the way it is all the time.” \nThrough five games, Cowart has recorded just four assisted tackles and two quarterback hurries but Muschamp said that he’s pleased with the freshman’s performance in the “20-something” snaps he’s received per game. \n“He's contributing…I've been very pleased with where he is and what he's doing,” Muschamp said. “He made a nice penetration (against San Jose State Saturday), a big down for us right there to get them in a negative down and distance, forced a punt a play later. I've been pleased.” Auburn DC Will Muschamp not happy with play from Tigers defense Matthew Stevens \nCowart was named the nation’s top recruit by ESPN.com after impressing scouts at the Under Armour All-American game and getting 29 career sacks at Armwood High School while leading them to the state championship game back-to-back years. \nIt was assumed because of Cowart’s domination at the high school level that production would quickly follow for the 277-pound defensive end but his position coach, Rodney Garner , tried to warn the public against high expectations for the five-star prospect from Seffner, Florida. \n“With the media stuff in recruiting, it builds them up and they come in with all this pressure now,” Garner said on Aug. 14. “It ain’t a microwave where you can throw it in for 30 seconds and it’s a done deal. We’ve got to encourage him that he’s going through a long process.” \nCowart, who is not allowed to speak to the media as a true freshman, is in the process of trying block out distractions and that included deleting his Twitter account shortly after publicly expressing first-year frustrations on the social media account in August. \nMuschamp acknowledged that the opening week injury to Carl Lawson could result in Cowart seeing more playing time in the second half of the 2015 season. Auburn (3-2, 0-2 in Southeastern Conference) is trying to use this bye week to put extra emphasis on individual player development and Cowart is at the top of their priority list. \n“Again, the game continues to slow down the more reps and the more turns and the more times you get to visualize and see things,” Muschamp said. “There's no question (the bye week) is huge for him.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RwYgHW Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:31:33.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
