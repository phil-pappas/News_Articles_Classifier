The match was her first since the Flushing tumble.\n“I thought I was physically ready, but unfortunately, the symptoms of my concussion came back,” Bouchard said after her exit. “I hope to get well soon and look forward to returning next year.”\nHer concerned opponent, Andrea Petkovic, said Bouchard told her that since sustaining the concussion, she had frequently experienced dizziness following intense physical activity.\nThe lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from the USTA and the Queens facility for negligence.\n  eugenie bouchard ,  lawsuits ,  queens ,  tennis ,  us open tennis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:20:02.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
