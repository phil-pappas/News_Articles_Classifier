Seattle defeated New Orleans 23-15. Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports The state of the Seattle Seahawks' backfield remains muddled in advance of Sunday's road game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\nAdChoices Marshawn Lynch, who last week missed only his second game since joining the Seahawks in 2010, remains day-to-day and could wind up a game-time decision despite making a lot of \"progress,\" coach Pete Carroll said Wednesday.\nPete Carroll said #Seahawks are going \"day to day\" on Marshawn Lynch's hamstring. Made a lot of \"progress\" Taking to end of week\n— Gregg Bell (@gbellseattle) October 7, 2015 Undrafted rookie Thomas Rawls replaced an injured Lynch in Week 3 and rush for 104 yards on 16 carries, but he was limited to 47 yards on 18 rushes in Monday night's victory over the Detroit Lions.\nComplicating matters for Seattle is an injury to backup running back Fred Jackson, who had to exit Monday's game due to a high ankle sprain. However, Carroll said it was a \"bit of a surprise\" how well Jackson was moving around Wednesday.\nThe Seahawks will also be without cornerback Marcus Burley, who suffered a broken thumb in Monday's game and is scheduled to undergo surgery Thursday. Defensive tackle Brandon Mebane is expected back against the Bengals.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/gbellseattle/status/651854560063959040", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Seahawks?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:51:37.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
