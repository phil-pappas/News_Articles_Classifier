The Ukrainian nailed Matthysse with a vicious right hand over a left jab that sent the Argentine to the canvas and ended the fight at the StubHub Center stadium in Los Angeles. Postol bettered his record to 28-0 with 12 knockouts. Matthysse (37-4, 34 KOs) wasn’t able to handle the taller Postol, who had a substantial height and reach advantage but was regarded as the underdog. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:59:13.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
