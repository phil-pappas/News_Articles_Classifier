Steve Spurrier: \"I sort of fired myself. That’s one way to look at it. I don’t think I’ve done a very good job this year. I really don’t.\" — Josh Kendall (@JoshatTheState) October 14, 2015 \nSitting at 2-4, the Gamecocks are on the precipice of not playing in a bowl game for the first time since 2007. Spurrier says he will not coach in college again: \"No. College football is a game of recruiting. Another reason I need to move on.\" — Stewart Mandel (@slmandel) October 13, 2015 \nPer Spurrier's press conference , he mentioned attributing factors as to why the program has fallen from where it had previously been earlier in his tenure. Spurrier's lack of drive when it comes to recruiting has been somewhat evident. South Carolina's been plagued by a lack of playable depth. As such, it's been relying upon an inordinate amount of current and former walk-on players. Spurrier: \"Yesterday I was sort of a recruiting liability. The recruits want to know he’ll be there 5-10 years from now\" — Brett McMurphy (@McMurphyESPN) October 13, 2015 \nThe lifeblood of any program sits in the realm of recruiting. While no one will ever question Spurrier's legacy or knowledge of the game, a younger option at the head coaching position may be the jolt South Carolina needs to launch itself back into SEC East Division contention.
