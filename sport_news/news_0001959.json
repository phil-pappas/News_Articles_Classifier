Nunez took over the following week and also started in a loss at Missouri. \nConnor Mitch, who began the season as the starter, remains out with a separated shoulder he sustained in a loss to Kentucky last month. \nThe Gamecocks (2-3, 0-3 Southeastern Conference) had their home game with LSU (4-0, 2-0) shifted to Louisiana because of flooding in South Carolina. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:30:14.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
