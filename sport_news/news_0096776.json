Posted: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 11:12 pm Elks double up Cadillac By JAMES COOK jcook@record-eagle.com Record-Eagle.com \nELK RAPIDS — Cadillac is almost twice as big as Elk Rapids in enrollment. \nOn Wednesday, the Elks put up twice as many goals. \nElk Rapids — with its 387 enrollment — took down 766-student Cadillac 2-1 in a non-conference soccer match. \nIt hasn't been unusual for the Elks to take on bigger teams this year. They've challenged Petoskey (972), Ludington (651), Williamston (657) and Whitehall (657), losing each time out. \n\"The record to me is not what's important,\" Elk Rapids coach Nate Plum said. \"It's are we getting better. Are we seeing what we need to see? We can play teams that won't show us that all the time, so you have to play teams to see where you've got to get better. It's nice to kind of see some of the fruits of that coming off.\" \nThe Elks are 8-9-1 this season, while Cadillac falls to 6-7. \nThe game was knotted up 0-0 at halftime, but the Elks came out and took control in the second half. \nGrayson Krakow found Rodrigo Pena Sancha in the middle of the box for a shot he buried to give the Elks a 2-1 lead with 22 minutes, 23 seconds remaining. \n\"Ball movement was huge,\" Krakow said. \"We were switching sides so quickly, it gave us a lot of chances.\" \nCadillac had tied it up 1-1 on a Brendan Shanahan goal off the foot of an Elks defender. \nElk Rapids opened up the scoring with an Eliot Huggins shot to the low left side, set up by Chris Shumate 9:29 into the second half. \n\"We've been getting more dangerous and more dangerous every game,\" Plum said. \"It's nice to see us put the ball in the net. We left a few goals out there on the field that could have made it a little more comfortable, but we'll take a win.\" \nThe Elks had several other prime opportunities to add some breathing room, as Carson Altonen and Huggins both created solid chances that either went wide or were stopped by Cadillac netminder David Greenfield. \n\"We've really worked hard on switching everything up, so we can push more guys forward,\" Plum said. \"And it's working. It's definitely working.\" \nThe Elks outshot Cadillac 13-8. Thom Derks made seven saves for Elk Rapids, while the Vikings' Greenfield had 11 stops. \n\"We were taking more shots,\" Krakow said. \"Normally, we're trying to get the perfect shot and this time we just put of lot of them on the goalie.\" \nThe Elks host Grayling in league play tonight.
