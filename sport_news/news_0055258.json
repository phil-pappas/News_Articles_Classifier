That day may be at hand.\nAt the Sept. 30 meeting, the village's plan commission unanimously endorsed a series of enhancements to the Green Bay Road shopping center put forward in a design review application submitted by the property manager, United Investors Inc.\nThe irregular-shaped property near the Glencoe-Winnetka border, which is highlighted by a 7-Eleven, a Walgreens and a Binny's Beverage Depot, has long been a source of consternation in the village given its lackluster appearance.\n\"I had some visitors visiting me from Georgia and they said, how can this be in Glencoe,\" said plan commissioner Dudley Onderdonk.\nBut the 35,000-square-foot complex, constructed in the 1950s, is now going to get a facelift as the owners, Chicago-based Giannoulias Enterprises Inc., believe it is time to improve the aesthetics.\n\"It was decided it needed to be done,\" said Michael Galanopulos, the chief financial officer for United Investors. \"The tenants have been asking us when it was going to get done and now it is a go and let's do it.\"\nOverall, the shopping center currently has 11 tenants with one vacancy, according to United officials.\nAmong the changes promised are shrubs on the planting strips near the Green Bay Road entrance with some additional shrubbery within the parking lot islands, plus a larger number of planter boxes and trash containers. United asked for outside seating in the southwest corner of the parking lot, but commissioners believed additional landscaping would be better and therefore that part of the request was withdrawn.\nOther changes include a new LED sign, replacing the existing one. Originally, it was slated to be 16 feet tall, but the village requested and United agreed to lower it to 12-13 feet.\n\"I think the facade improvements and the landscaping upgrades are a huge improvement,\" said Public Works Director David Mau.\nThe changes also call for unsigned black fabric awnings – without signage – to be placed throughout the center.\n\"This will add uniformity to the building, while also reducing the number of signs per storefront from two to one,\" said Nathan Parch, the village's planning and development administrator.\nJennifer Bishop-Jenkins, owner of Love Fur Dogs, an animal grooming business, was particularly excited about the awnings as her establishment faces west and there is a lot of glare with the afternoon sun.\n\"This is going to make our lobby much more pleasant for our customers,\" Bishop-Jenkins said.\nCommissioner Marya Morris did voice a concern about the color of the awnings.\n\"It just looks depressing,\" Morris said.\nMoving forward, the exterior of the facade will be painted gray with some white trimming.\n\"It certainly is not an obnoxious color,\" said Village Planner Lee Brown. \"This is anything but battleship.\"\nFinally, the parking lot, which Chairwoman Caren Thomas described as \"hated\" will have additional striping and better directional signage under the plan.\n\"We are going to update the 'no parking' signs and the towing signs that are on the poles,\" said Heather Smalec, a United property manager. \"They are all faded out.\"\nThe parking lot changes follow a resurfacing that was completed earlier this year.\nSmalec added that a new snow removal vendor will be in place this winter that will be charged with placing excess snow behind the 7-Eleven in the northern part of the center. United was not pleased with the work of the snow removal crews last year that allowed snow to pile up in the main parking lot.\nSmalec, who would not disclose the money that will be spent for the renovation, said the work will begin in October with a goal of completion by the end of the year, with the exception of the landscaping, which is slated for next spring.\nThe planned changes at Hubbard Woods represent a sigh of relief for village officials.\n\"I think redoing this site is long overdue,\" Onderdonk said. \"I'm really happy to see something happen.\"\nDaniel I.
