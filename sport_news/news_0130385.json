If a slouchy coat has a large shape, keep what you’re pairing with it minimalistic and slim, she says. “Very skinny jeans or leggings—it shows that you still have a feminine side and that there’s some shape under that coat,” says Ms. Dahan, who co-founded the company in 1999 with Eran Elfassy, who is also her co-creative director.\nFive Tips\nENLARGE If a slouchy coat has a large shape, keep what you’re pairing with it minimalistic and slim. Photo: Will Lew for The Wall Street Journal Make sure what you’re wearing underneath is form-fitting so you show some shape. Seek out a softer fabric, not a stiff one, so the style drapes well. Solid colors are a safer bet -- pick one with unusual detailing such as fringe or leather touches. If you’re petite, pick a short coat or a much longer one, which will elongate you. Pair a small handbag with an oversize coat. With boyfriend-style shapes—so named because you’re supposed to appear as if you’ve borrowed your boyfriend’s coat—Ms. Dahan sometimes likes to wear a miniskirt. “If you do a slouchy pant with a slouchy top and an oversized coat, you’ll suddenly look short.”\nThis is important with ponchos and capes, which have a larger, more striking silhouette, though Ms. Dahan said it’s OK to wear chunky knits or blazers underneath such outerwear. “With a poncho or capelet, you have the room to do that,” she says. “You can basically throw them over everything.”\nFabrication is key when it comes to ponchos and capes. “Knitted fabrics can make it look too casual,” Ms. Dahan says, noting that such materials might not be polished enough to wear to work. Instead, look for something in a double-faced wool, perhaps with detailing like a leather fringe. “It has that elegance but you still have that chic look to it,” she says.\nAlso, with oversize silhouettes in general, it’s best to steer clear of even slightly structured fabrics, which can make them “really dramatic and hard to wear—you don’t want a coat to stand on its own,” Ms. Dahan says. “You want your body to be the hanger so avoid anything that’s stiff, that doesn’t really move.”\nColor and patterns should be weighed carefully as well. “Solid colors are the easiest way to go—with oversized looks, you don’t want the coat to be the only thing you see,” Ms. Dahan says. “And the louder it is, the harder it is to wear every day. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have a pop of color in it.”\nENLARGE ‘Solid colors are the easiest way to go—with oversized looks, you don’t want the coat to be the only thing you see,’ says Elisa Dahan. Photo: Will Lew for The Wall Street Journal Ms. Dahan says she’s partial to oversize pieces in light gray, navy blue or off-white. “Black is always a go-to but there are ways to make it look fun—fringe details or leather details,” she adds. “You can still have little elements of surprise.”\nIf you’re petite—like the 5-foot-3 Ms. Dahan—the length of these slouchy, large styles should be navigated carefully as oversize shapes can overwhelm a small figure. “When you’re petite, the length that you choose is really important,” she says. “It’s either you go really short or really long. The long coat will elongate your silhouette.”\nFor women who feel tepid about trying this trend, Ms. Dahan suggests picking a piece that has the look of being slightly oversize but isn’t. Some styles, for example, have a fairly fitted bodice but also a blousey, drapey collar “that has a waterfall effect in the front,” she says. “So from the back, you still have some shape but from the front you have that drape. (The oversize trend) can look amazing on supermodels but not everybody is 6-feet tall and super slim so this is a different way to wear it.”\nOr, if you’re truly unsure about investing in a coat just to try the trend, there are ways to do it in smaller ways. “Buying a poncho scarf [a large scarf that drapes like a poncho] and putting it over your coat gives you that effect without breaking the bank,” Ms. Dahan says.\nIf you choose an oversize piece, there’s one more element to consider. “Pick a small handbag, which is on trend right now,” Ms. Dahan says. “Don’t wear an oversized coat with an oversized bag—it’s too much.”\nWrite to Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan at cheryl.tan@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV824_1021TO_FR_20151020153243.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV825_1021TO_M_20151020153243.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:16:35.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
