It is perhaps for the first time in independent India that so many writers from such varied backgrounds have spoken in one voice in support of the freedom of speech and expression and against threats to social harmony and cultural diversity of the country. Those in the establishment who support killer gangs for implementing their narrow political agenda will be forced to listen to the conscious-keepers of society. It is good to see writers joining hands on issues that concern all. Murmurs of protest that began individually over the killings of writers and rationalists have transformed into a strong collective voice against attempts to shrink the space for dissent and the silence of the powers-that-be. Protests by one section or one group could be explained away or dismissed as politically motivated but not when so many different literary giants — mostly apolitical and recognised and honoured by the government itself — decide to come out in public to speak up against what they feel is wrong. A Nayantara Sahgal can be targeted for her “selective outrage”. Someone can stoop to be petty and ask her to return the award money. But the critics miss the point that so many writers in Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, Kannad, Malayalam etc are trying to make by surrendering their awards and quitting Sahitya Akademi posts. The point is simple: the citizen’s fundamental right to freedom of expression cannot be subject to the whims of a mob. The mob’s objections may be to a book, a film, food, dress or a religious practice. A creative voice is usually silenced to placate a mob that threatens public order or indulges in violence. This gives mobsters an incentive to do it again — and sometimes with greater force. Failure to uphold individual freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution, or worse, pandering to crowds to violate these is unpadonable. Under no circumstances can the State abdicate its responsibility to protect the life of an individual — be it a Kalburgi, a Dabolkar or a Mohammad Akhlak.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:10:06.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
