Since he was moved from shortstop to second base, Cubby Starlin Castro has led baseball with a .426 September batting average. And Cub starter Jake Arrieta has been lights out, notching a .99 ERA since the start of July. \nThe Dodgers won all seven contests against the Amazins this season. \nBut all those games games were played between May 11 and July 2. \nAs noted by ESPN , David Wright missed the entire season series because he was rehabbing a back injury. Travis d'Arnaud was on the shelf. Michael Conforto and Steven Matz had yet to be promoted from the minors. And Yoenis Cespedes, Kelly Johnson, Tyler Clippard and Addison Reed had not yet been acquired in four separate trades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:12:49.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
