That set up a 10-yard touchdown run by McCown to get Cleveland to 21-16. \n\"The penalties were a major problem,\" Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said. \"It's too many of them.\" \nWHAT A RUSH: The Browns defense entered Sunday's game ranked 31st in the NFL in defending the run. \nIn the first half, Cleveland -- bolstered by the return of defensive end Desmond Bryant -- held the Ravens to 34 yards on 11 carries. \nAfter that, however, the Browns reverted to form. Javorius Allen broke a 44-yard run down the home sideline to the Cleveland 18-yard line in the third quarter, and the Ravens finished with 181 yards rushing, 121 of them from Justin Forsett . \nWOUNDED: Playing without injured receiver Steve Smith and starting tight end Crockett Gillmore , the Ravens still managed to ring up 377 yards in offense. But the defense yielded 505 yards, most of them on McCown passes. \nInjuries to defensive backs Lardarius Webb , Will Davis and Kyle Arrington (in overtime) didn't help. \n\"It's huge when your players go down, but it's no excuse,\" cornerback Jimmy Smith said. \nForsett hurt his right ankle late in regulation and did not return. His status for Sunday's game in San Francisco has not yet been determined. \nADJUSTMENT MADE: When the Ravens defense blitzed to try to negate Cleveland's run game, the Browns adjusted. \nSometimes Cleveland went to multiple receivers and spread out the offense; sometimes McCown looked toward running back Duke Johnson, who hauled in eight passes for 55 yards. \n\"They were blitzing the safety and trying to do whatever they could to take away the run game,\" Browns tackle Joe Thomas said. \"So after the first quarter, we said we're going to play with three wide receivers and if they're going to try and blitz the run game, we're going to just make the throws on the edges and take the ball downfield. \n\"We knew it was going to be one of those huge passing yards games.\" \nMcCown surpassed 300 yards in a third straight game, the first time that's ever been done by a Cleveland quarterback.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:09:45.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
