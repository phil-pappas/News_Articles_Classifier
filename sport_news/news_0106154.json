He was 81.\nLanphere lived to see his first company, Beaverton Honda Motorcycles, celebrate its 50th anniversary last year.\nHe bought his first motorcycle after leaving the U.S. Army in 1955, and opened the motorcycle shop at Southwest Broadway and Hall, in the heart of downtown Beaverton, in 1964.\nSince, Lanphere grew his company, renamed Lanphere Enterprises, to include multiple car dealerships and a construction company.\nThroughout its growth, the company remained family-owned: Lanphere's son, Bob Lanphere Jr., is president of Lanphere Enterprises, and his daughter Sharon Lenz and granddaughter Rachel Lenz also hold positions.\nLanphere Enterprises' corporate headquarters remains in downtown Beaverton, and the company employs more than 800 people throughout the Northwest.\nBeaverton Mayor Denny Doyle said he met Lanphere about 20 years ago, and said he's thankful for the businessman's role as a proponent for the community.\n\"The jobs that he and his company have provided to Beaverton are priceless,\" he said.\nLanphere, along with other area car dealership owners, helped make Beaverton what it is today, Doyle said.\n\"It's just amazing,\" Doyle said of the dealerships' contribution. \"They've been very faithful to this community. People like Guy Carr (former owner of Carr Chevrolet), Randy Francis (former owner of Damerow Beaverton Ford), Mike Herzog (of Herzog-Meier Volvo) â€” everybody has been involved for 40, 50 years, and [the dealerships] are all still here. They all have a lot of impact.\"\nIn addition to providing jobs, Lanphere Enterprises regularly sponsored local events, like the Beaverton Celebration Parade.\n\"He was a great guy,\" said Doyle, who occasionally played golf with Lanphere. \"I'm going to miss seeing him.\"\n-- Anna Marum\namarum@oregonian.com\n503-294-5911\n@annamarum\nOregonian reporter Laura Frazier contributed to this story.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/annamarum"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:18:29.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
