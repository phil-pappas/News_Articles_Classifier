But they share another fact. The Tigers are actually the last team to beat the Eagles. \nThat happened in the quarterfinal round of last year's playoffs. \nSince that point, Deposit/Hancock has won eight straight games, and this year grabbed the two seed instead of the seven seed in the playoff bracket. \nThe team is the only undefeated Class D team left in Section IV. \nNow, the Eagles are hoping to rely on the experience of being in the playoffs last year, but this time change the outcome against seventh-seed Groton on Friday night. \n\"We actually played better than we thought we were going to against Tioga last year and having everybody back except for two guys helps us,\" said head coach Jeremiah Johnson. \"They're experienced, they're ready to go and I think being battle tested all year. You know, we played Walton and Greene and they're pretty tough teams. That is going to help us in the playoffs, I think.\" \n\"Playoffs is a whole new world, you've got a lot more pressure,\" added senior Ronnie Ballard. \"It's crazy.\" \nThe craziness begins in Hancock on Friday night at 7 p.m. as the Eagles face Groton.
