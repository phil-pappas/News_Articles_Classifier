Dual-sport athlete John Herman ’89, two-time track and field All-American Eric Holmes ’01, baseball ace Ryan Johnson ’02 and ground-breaking women’s golfer Molly McNamara ’03 comprise the 32nd class to be inducted into the college’s athletic Hall of Fame. The 8:30 a.m. ceremony on Saturday will be held on the main concourse of the Huff Athletic Center. The four inductees will then participate in the annual Homecoming parade at 11 a.m. and in pregame festivities before the Scots’ football team hosts Illinois College in a 1 p.m. kickoff at April Zorn Memorial Stadium. John Herman ‘89 From nearby Williamsfield High School, Herman made a lasting mark on two programs. On the hardwood, the 6-foot-4 Herman showed a versatile inside-out game, physical enough to average 5.5 rebounds for his career and score big buckets in the paint, but with an accurate three-point shot, too. He also posted the only triple double in Scots history that didn’t come against Grinnell’s high-scoring style. A first team All-Midwest Conference selection in 1989, Herman finished his career with exactly 1,000 points and one conference title (1988) while playing in two NCAA tournaments. Herman showed versatility on the diamond, too, posting a 12-3 career pitching record and batting .314 with 10 homers and 79 RBI as the Scots won MWC championships his sophomore and junior seasons. Moly McNamara ‘03 The first 15 years of women’s golf at Monmouth College are impossible to discuss without mention of McNamara. She was involved with the program for all but two of those years, first as the most honored women’s golfer in Fighting Scots history and then for nine years as coach, leading the team to five upper-half finishes in the Midwest Conference. She was a vital part of Monmouth’s first league crown in 2002, earning all-conference honors with a third-place finish. It was one of three top-five, All-MWC finishes for McNamara. Until weeks before the time of her induction, her round of 81 on Monmouth’s home course of Gibson Woods was the school record, and she was second on Scots’ honor roll for season average (87.1) and third in career average (92.3). Eric Holmes ‘01 Fourteen years after he last competed for the Fighting Scots, with several championship-caliber throwers who followed him, Eric Holmes still holds the top three indoor shot put efforts in school history. His school-record 56’3-1/4 throw at the 2001 NCAA indoor meet earned Monmouth’s first-ever national runner-up finish. Page 2 of 2 - Ryan Johnson ‘02 His complete-game, 4-0 victory over the nation’s No. 3 team, Aurora, in the 2002 Midwest Regional was Johnson’s final outing during a memorable senior year that saw him go 9-0 with a 0.90 ERA in his final 60 innings. A four-time first team All-Midwest Conference selection, Johnson earned All-Midwest Region and MWC Pitcher of the Year honors as a senior. At the time of induction, Johnson was in the top five in career wins (23), ERA (2.60), shutouts (5) and strikeouts (199).
