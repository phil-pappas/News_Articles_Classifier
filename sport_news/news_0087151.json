Cedar Grove built a 14-0 lead and relied on its rushing attack and defense to keep the Tornadoes in check late in the second half. The win improves the Panthers' record to 6-1, while Orange falls to 6-1 on the season. \n\"We played very, very hard,\" senior quarterback Nick Zecchino said. \"It was a great team win. Orange was undefeated and we knew we had to play a good game and we came out on top.\" \nThe Panthers scored first after extending a drive from late in the first quarter into the second. Cedar Grove faced a fourth down at the Orange 44 when the special teams unit was called on to perform a trick play. Zecchino lined up as the long snapper and sent the ball to junior Joseph Rufo. Rufo faked a run to his right and found Zecchino open down the field. The duo connected for a 40-yard gain, which set up the Panthers inside the five heading into the second quarter. \n\"It was a great [play] call,\" Zecchino said. \"We've been working on it all year and all week. We had faith we could do it in the game and that's exactly what happened. Joe Rufo made a nice throw to me and I ran it as far as I could.\" \nHead coach Ed Sadloch said he does not deserve any credit for the successful fake punt play. \n\"That wasn't my call,\" he said. \"That was our special teams coordinator... he asked me and I said 'go ahead'. We've done it twice already [this year] and we've had success both times.\" \nJunior running back Dan DiPrenda finished the Cedar Grove drive with a two-yard touchdown run to give the Panthers a 6-0 advantage early in the second quarter. The Panthers held their six-point lead heading into the half. \nCedar Grove came out with an aggressive approach on offense to start the third quarter and looked to the passing game to move the ball down the field. Zecchino found senior Tom Greatorex running a post route up the middle of the field for a big gain. \nThe long pass set the Panthers up at the Orange 11-yard line, but a holding penalty moved the ball back to the Tornadoes' 22 on second down. That set the stage for Zecchino's touchdown pass to junior receiver Evidence Njoku. The senior quarterback tossed a jump ball into the end zone that Njoku snagged it out of the air for the score. \n\"We had [three receivers] to the right and I saw Evidence one-on-one and I love that matchup,\" Zecchino said. \"I knew he would make a play and he came through for us.\" \nThe Panthers converted a two-point pass to senior running back Matt McManus to take a 14-0 lead with 9:01 remaining in the third quarter. However, Orange would find the end zone before the end of the quarter. Faced with a fourth down deep in Panther territory, the Tornadoes elected to attempt a trick play and found the end zone through the air. \nThe Orange quarterback handed the ball to the running back, who pulled up behind the line of scrimmage and threw the ball to a receiver open in the end zone for the score. The Tornadoes converted a two-point passing play to make the score 14-8 with 3:49 remaining in the third quarter. \nBoth defenses dominated the fourth quarter of play until the final drive, when Cedar Grove managed to take the ball down the field and run out the clock. The Panthers relied on a rushing attack consisting of DiPrenda and seniors Dom Ferrara and Michael Slattery. DiPrenda received a majority of the carries on the drive and ran for three first downs, including the game-clinching fourth down run with a little less than a minute to play. \n\"Danny is a beast,\" Zecchino said. \"He doesn't go down, he runs the ball very hard and it showed at the end.\" \nCedar Grove forced Orange to use its remaining timeouts and took a knee to end the game with a victory. Sadloch said the final drive, which lasted for over five minutes, showed him a great deal about his team. \n\"I thought it was a great drive and really showed some great character to go down the field, kill the clock and win the game,\" he said. \nThe Panthers will celebrate the win Saturday, but will begin preparing for a tough two-game stretch to finish the regular season. Cedar Grove will host Shabazz Friday, Oct. 30 at 7 p.m. a week before a showdown with rival Verona to close the season Nov. 7. \n\"[The win] gives us a lot of confidence until next week when we have Shabazz,\" Sadloch said. And then we have Verona after that, so we don't really have a chance to rest.\" \nDespite a sound win against a tough Orange opponent, Sadloch said there is still work to be done. \n\"We can improve everyday. Everything has to improve.\" \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:38:56.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
