The defensive back, who rotates in at the safety position, will be fully available for the Phoenix on Saturday in its Colonial Athletic Association assignment at Richmond. Maddox was assessed the penalty, a personal foul which, by rule, results in automatic disqualification, when he unloaded a punishing blow on New Hampshire tight end Jordan Powell, the intended receiver on an incomplete pass down the middle, late in the first quarter. Relegated to the Elon locker room, Maddox missed the remainder of the game. Had that play last week occurred in the second half, he would’ve been required to sit out the first half of Saturday’s game against Richmond. It’s a situation that has become a teachable moment for Elon, an opportunity for coach Rich Skrosky and his staff to clarify and reiterate the rules while also continuing to stress proper tackling techniques. It’s also the source of some frustration when considering that the game was televised. Elon submitted video clips of the play to the league office and Jim Maconaghy, the CAA’s coordinator of officials. The league responded there was no conclusive video evidence on any camera angle that would’ve overturned the call. “I think when in doubt applies in this case and I support the call,” Skrosky said, reading the league’s reply. “When in question this is a safety foul and should be called. Receiver is defenseless. Elon player launches. High hit.” That’s fine, Skrosky said. His chief issue, though: The call wasn’t reviewed in real time by the game officials because the game, although on TV, wasn’t equipped for replay at Cowell Stadium, New Hampshire’s aged facility that is undergoing renovations. Video replay doesn’t take effect as a league-wide mandate until next season. But Elon, for example, has a replay system for the officiating crews at all of its home games. So, too, does Richmond. “My biggest beef with it, we’re in 2015 and doggone it, it’s a TV game,” Skrosky said. “If they look at it and then don’t overturn it, then it is what it is. But the fact that in today’s day and age we can’t go to the video and review it, that to me is not doing right by the kid.” Last season, Elon safety Miles Williams was penalized for targeting and thus disqualified from a game at home against the visiting Charlotte 49ers. Page 2 of 3 - Officials then went to the replay and upon further review, reversed the call. So Williams wasn’t disqualified and played on in what unfolded as Elon’s only victory of 2014. “These are the reasons you have replay,” Skrosky said. He said in his opinion, Maddox’s hit last week on Powell was clean, a shoulder to the chest that produced a resounding impact and momentarily felled the New Hampshire tight end. “It’s bang-bang and there’s a whiplash effect, so it’s going to draw the flag,” Skrosky said. “Our kids know that. We’ve trained them and we’ve got to train them better. “If it’s close, they’re going to err on the side of the kid’s safety, and we want the kids to be safe.” Maddox said when he saw the yellow flag last week, he suspected that the ensuing penalty would be for taunting. He stood over the laid-out Powell for a second or two in a showy manner after delivering the hit. “Initially, I was like, ‘I’m going to probably get 15 (yards) for taunting,’” Maddox said. “But when I heard the ref make the call and heard I was disqualified, I was a bit shocked. Just had to accept the call. “After looking at the film and seeing that I did indeed launch myself, even though I led with my shoulder, it’s something we can all learn from. I mean, they didn’t call the taunting, but I could’ve easily gotten penalized for that.” The ejection made for something of a weird experience for Maddox, a junior. The Phoenix trailed 14-0 at that juncture in the eventual 37-14 loss. There were no televisions in Elon’s visiting locker room, tucked behind the stands on the New Hampshire sideline, so he tried to gauge what was happening during the game based on the fans’ noise and reactions. He eventually helped put out water and bananas for his teammates. “It was frustrating,” Maddox said. “You want to be out there with your team, supporting your team, but you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do. I could hear the fans on top of me as I was under them (in the locker room). Just tried to still be in tune to the game.” Kickoff Who: Elon (2-3, 1-1) at No. 16 Richmond (3-1, 1-0) When: 3:30 p.m. Saturday Page 3 of 3 - Where: Robins Stadium, Richmond, Va.
