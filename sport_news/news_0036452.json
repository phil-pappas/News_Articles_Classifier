(Source: WABC/CNN) \nBEDFORD, NY (WABC/CNN) - A century old, a century wise and a century of being a Mets fan. All three are true for a New York women who is one of the team's most diehard fans. \n\"From 1936, I've been watching baseball,” says Adeline Russo, a 100-year-old Mets fan. At 100, she might be the oldest Mets fan alive, and she's definitely one of the most die-hard. \nThe Bedford woman watches every pitch, even in seasons when the Amazins are dead last. She even attended every home game of the 1986 Mets World Series! \n\"You see the TV. I enjoy TV but you gotta be there to really enjoy it,” she said. \nRusso was born in 1915. Raised in Brooklyn, she started out as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. But when the Dodgers moved to California in 1957 she made a decision. \"I had no use for them. They gave up Brooklyn for California!\" she said. \nSo when the Mets formed in 1962 she became a season ticket holder. She remembers when a seat behind first base cost only 50 cents! \nHer son Gerry says you can tell how the team is doing just by the expression on her face. \"Die-hard fan, roots like hell while the TV is on. You can hear her three rooms away,” he said. \nAnd Gerry says if you're a Yankee fan she'll throw you right out of the house. Because after all, you wouldn't be a true Mets fan unless you have a healthy dislike for that other team across town. \n\"Never had any use for them. Never. Never,” she said of the hated Yankees. \nBut why? \"Why?! Because when they beat us for the (World) Series they laughed like fools at us. Laughing like hell!\" she said. \nIn fact, on Wednesday she turned 100. But she says if the Mets beat the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday, which they did, Thursday will be the day she will always remember. \nCopyright 2015 WABC via CNN. All rights reserved.
