And he must worry about whether he will actually get the chance to race for that championship.\nThere is little debate about what Logano did on Sunday. He took Matt Kenseth out. He wrecked him for the win .\nSure, it was hard racing between two fierce competitors, but Logano made his decision, and he made it knowing what the likely outcome would be.\n“It was really cut and dry, he picked my rear tires off the ground and wrecked me, so there’s no debate about that one,” Kenseth said. “He just plain wrecked me.”\nDoes the normally mild-mannered Kenseth believe Logano wrecked him on purpose?\n“Absolutely, 100 percent.”\nTo some, that’s a credit to Logano. He’s a hard-charger, an aggressive racer, one who will do whatever it takes to win a race and a championship.\nPlenty of great drivers before him have done the same thing. Dale Earnhardt. Darrell Waltrip. Rusty Wallace. Jeff Gordon. In a sense, that hard-charging, take-no-prisoners style is what makes stock-car drivers great.\nBut there’s one big difference.\nLogano wrecked Kenseth at the absolute worst time. Wrecked him when he knew it would hurt Kenseth the most.\nPHOTOS: Must-see photos from Kansas | Jeff Gordon's final season\nLogano won last week’s race at Charlotte, which under NASCAR’s new Chase rules, guarantees him a spot in the next round. He didn’t have to win again at Kansas to advance, and doing so gave him only a slight advantage in the Chase.\nKenseth did need to win at Kansas. After having trouble at Charlotte in the first race of Round 2, he was in desperation mode, needing to win to ensure that his championship hopes remain alive.\nAnd he did everything he could to make that happen. He led 153 of 269 laps and held the lead with just three laps to go. He was on his way to Round 3 when Logano wrecked him.\nNow Kenseth is last among the 12 Chase drivers remaining and must win this week at Talladega to advance. That will be a much riskier proposition at a track where restrictor-plate racing is a complete crapshoot.\nUnless Kenseth wins Sunday, his championships hopes will be over in what has been a fabulous five-win season. And he will have Logano to blame.\nShort of injuring him, Logano could not have done Kenseth more wrong. He might as well have walked up to him after the race and slapped him in the face. That’s the kind of disrespectful insult he delivered on the track.\nNow he must live with the consequences.\nNow Logano, who made it to the final championship race last year, will have to run the final five races looking over his shoulder, wondering when Kenseth or one of his Joe Gibbs Racing teammates will retaliate or put Logano in a similar spot.\nKenseth is not above getting even. Though one of the nicest and most respected drivers in the sport, he has a temper and does not condone disrespect or being run over. After Logano teammate Brad Keselowski hit him during a critical Chase race at Charlotte last year, Kenseth chased him through the garage and attacked him, leaping on his back to ignite a scuffle between their crews.\nWhy he didn’t go to victory lane to confront Logano after Sunday’s race is a mystery. Perhaps he knows it wouldn’t have done any good. Perhaps he has something else in mind — an eye for an eye.\nKenseth made it clear he lost a lot of respect for Logano.\n“I won’t talk to Joey, I don’t have anything to talk to him about really,” he said. “You make decisions every day, you make decisions every minute behind the wheel. To me, strategically, that doesn’t seem like such a great decision for him, but it’s the one he made and that’s how he wanted to win.\n“I’m one of the only guys that I think hasn’t been into (it) yet with Joey and I’ve always raced him with a ton of respect; I’ve actually been one of his biggest fans. I’m certainly not anymore.”\nKenseth didn’t threaten to get even with Logano, but he hinted that the gloves are now off between the two and he will cut him no slack.\n“You always race people like you’d like to be raced. That’s what I try to do until that changes, and then you race them how they race you,” he said.\nLogano chalked the incident up to “hard racing,” saying Kenseth ran him into the wall twice while trying to block him. He said he was merely trying to win the race when they made contact.\n“I wanted that middle lane and so did he, and we collided there. It was hard racing,” he said. “We ran each other hard. He ran me hard and I ran him hard back. That’s the type of driver I am and the type of racer I’m gonna be, and it just comes to that point sometimes (and) unfortunately those things happen.”\nNow Logano must worry about whether it happens to him.\nIf Kenseth is eliminated from the Chase at Talladega, he will have a prime opportunity to get even Nov. 1 at Martinsville, a tight short track that lends itself to accidental and intentional contact. It would be the perfect place to take Logano out and ruin his championship hopes.\nLogano also must worry about Kenseth’s Joe Gibbs Racing teammates. Logano used to drive for Gibbs — drove Kenseth’s No. 20, in fact — and him taking out Kenseth in such a costly situation will be seen as a sign of disrespect toward his former employer and teammates. You can bet his name is mud right now at JGR.\nWhile Kenseth and Kyle Busch are both scrambling to remain alive in the Chase, JGR teammates Denny Hamlin and Carl Edwards are still in the hunt, sitting second and fourth, respectively, in the standings. Neither is likely to cut Logano any slack on the track. Neither will Kenseth nor Busch, who would have nothing to lose by getting even with Logano.\nLogano shrugged off any concern about retaliation or getting even.\n“There’s a lot of aggression there and that’s what our sport is built on,” he said. “Our sport is built on stuff like that and going forward and we’re gonna race. That’s what we do. That’s what we do every week. We go out there and race each other.\n“These things always seem to happen every now and again and you work it out. Eventually, it all comes out fine.”\nExcept it didn’t come out fine for Kenseth.\nAnd it likely won’t for Logano either.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658601-nascar-sprint-cup-chase-kansas-dale-earnhardt-junior-matt-kenseth-win", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658620-nascar-sprint-cup-chase-grid-standings-talladega-camping-world-500-gordon-harvick-kenseth-hamlin-busch", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;No", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4637689-jeff-gordon-retirement-nascar-sprint-cup-photos-2015-daytona-atlanta-talladega", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfzv21.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;With", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658628-nascar-sprint-cup-chase-hollywood-casino-400-photos-pictures-joey-logano-kyle-busch", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Who", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfBkj9.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;NASCAR", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658647-nascar-sprint-cup-dale-earnhardt-jr-kansas-speedway-hollywood-casino-finish-standings", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Logano", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658566-kyle-busch-chase-is-entertaining-not-necessarily-fair-nascar-sprint-cup", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfB2uL.img&quot;}}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;racing&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfBsnv.img&quot;}}"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:49:47.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
