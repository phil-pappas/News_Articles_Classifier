His two teams wound up on different sides of the bracket, and their opponents were switched. \nClass 7A girls state tennis tournament \nat Memorial Park, Bentonville \nTeam Scores \nSingles \nBentonville 19, Mount St. Mary 6, Rogers High 5, Fayetteville 4, Fort Smith Northside 1, Van Buren 1. \nSemifinals \nAdriana Canigova, Bentonville def. Brooke Buckner, Mount St. Mary 6-0, 6-0; Margaret Lucas, Mount St. Mary def. Katherine Tang, Rogers High 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 \nChampionship \nCanigova, Bentonville def. Lucas, Mount St. Mary 6-3, 6-3 \nDoubles \nSemifinals \nBessie Sullivan/Taylor Cheung-Damonte, Bentonville def. Lewis/McKinney, Rogers High 7-5, 6-1; Avery Hargrove/Emily Gean, Bentonville def. Cameron Churchill/Anna Mauromoustakos, Fayetteville 6-2, 6-3. \nChampionship \nSullivan/Cheung-Damonte, Bentonville vs. Hargrove/Gean, Bentonville 1-6, 7-5, 6-2. \nThat didn't matter as both teams won and set up an all-Bentonville final, and the Lady Tigers proceeded to win their second consecutive state title Tuesday at Memorial Park. Bentonville finished with 19 points, while Mount St. Mary was a distant second with six, one point more than third place Rogers High. \n\"It was an easy fix,\" Nersesian said. \"It was just an adjustment you have to make. \n\"These girls really prepared well for this year. They worked hard and listened to their coaches, and they put that time in. It's what you do early in the year and through the summer to get yourself ready for high school tennis. It's nice that these girls could put it all together.\" \nBessie Sullivan and Taylor Cheung-Damonte, a transfer from Canada, teamed up for a 7-5, 6-1 win over Rogers High's team of Addy Lewis and Maddie McKinney. Meanwhile, Bentonville teammates Avery Hargrove and Emily Gean advanced with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Fayetteville's Cameron Churchill and Anna Mauromoustakos. \nSullivan and Cheung-Damonte then overcame a shaky start to knock off Hargrove and Gean in three sets to claim the doubles title. \n\"It's difficult because it's not just tennis,\" Sullivan said. \"It's friendship, it's teammates and it's also like you want to win. There's a balance between 'Do I play nice, or do I go after them like I do the other teams?' \n\"It was also like this during the conference tournament, and I think that helped us here.\" \nMeanwhile, Adriana Canigova gave Bentonville added points with her 6-3, 6-3 victory over Mount St. Mary's Margaret Lucas to win the singles title. Canigova, an exchange student from Croatia, won the title despite some shoulder issues that caused her to use what looked like an underhanded serve. \nCanigova didn't lose a point throughout her first two matches, including an earlier 6-0, 6-0 win over Mount St. Mary's Brooke Buckner in a match that lasted just 34 minutes. Lucas adjusted to the unorthodox serve and broke it twice in the first set, but Canigova proved to be too much. \n\"Having Taylor move in was a blessing because she was jelling with Bessie,\" Nersesian said. \"Adriana was playing good, and she knows what she can and can not do.\" \nSports on 10/21/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:16:17.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
