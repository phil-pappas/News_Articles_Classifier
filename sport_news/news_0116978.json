That’s my target.” \n“I worked very hard this season so it comes as no surprise to me. If I win, I will be glad, otherwise I will still feel privileged.” \nOfori’s great form for his club side earned him a call-up to the Black Stars as well as being number one for the national Olympic team, Black Meteors, and local Black Stars. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
