He broke his foot in a win over New York. \nCowboys owner Jerry Jones said there was no “set line of demarcation on this or anything.” \nGarrett and Jones said Bryant’s feedback will have a lot to do with the decision on the 2014 All-Pro’s return. The Cowboys have lost three straight games without Tony Romo and Bryant. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:35:11.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
