Each time, the Colts’ defense was run over. Each time, Indianapolis read the stats, endured the film sessions and searched for answers. On Sunday night, the Colts get another chance. \n“We’ve got to play physical,” defensive coordinator Greg Manusky said. “We’ve got to play strong up front to stop the run, you’ve got to strike some individuals and get them off you.” \nIt’s not merely a philosophical change. It’s a necessary one. \nAfter watching the Patriots gash Indy for 722 yards and 15 touchdowns on the ground in those four games, coach Chuck Pagano and general manager Ryan Grigson committed themselves to finding a better run defense. They signed free agent defensive end Kendall Langford. They drafted Stanford defensive linemen Henry Anderson and David Parry. After former starting end Cory Redding left in free agency and putting defensive tackle Art Jones on injured reserve in September, they cut defensive tackles Josh Chapman and Montori Hughes. \nNow, using an entirely new starting defensive line, the Colts (3-2) are making progress. \nLast week, they held Arian Foster, an old nemesis, in check. Their last four opponents - the Jets, Titans, Jaguars and Texans - have averaged just 3.8 yards per carry. \n“I love the direction they’re going, the way they’ve played, the numbers the last couple weeks,” coach Chuck Pagano said. “They’ve done a nice job. Under 100 yards, all that stuff. They’re doing well.” \nNext up is the biggest test of all - stopping the Patriots (4-0), who have run roughshod over Indianapolis. \nLeGarrette Blount rushed for 166 yards and a franchise playoff record four TDs in January 2014 then piled up another 138 yards and three more TDs in January’s AFC championship game. Jonas Gray finished with a career high 201 yards and set a regular season franchise record with four more TD runs last November. \nThe one time Indy didn’t allow a 100-yard rusher during that span, Tom Brady threw three TD passes and New England returned a punt and two interceptions for touchdowns. \nThis year, the Colts will have to contend with Blount again and Dion Lewis, a former Indy running back. \nWhy should anyone think this time will be different? \nFor starters, the Patriots (4-0) will be missing left tackle Nate Solder after he was placed on season-ending injured reserve Wednesday with a left arm injury. \n“It’s a tough loss,” receiver Julian Edelman said. “Nate is a big part of our team, great locker room guy, a guy who’s just a true professional. All that means is that other guys are going to have to come in and step up and be prepared to do their job.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:23:32.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
