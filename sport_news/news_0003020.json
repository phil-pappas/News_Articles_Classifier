But MLB made no defamatory statements directly, Rodriguez ruled in dismissing the suit.\n“Clearly, nothing shown or said which can be attributed to any of the defendants during the Telecast, on MLB.com or on YouTube concerning the Plaintiff rises to the level of an act of extreme and outrageous conduct,” she wrote.\nThe judge’s ruling means Rector won’t get a hoped-for cash settlement. His lawyer, Valentine Okwara, could not immediately be reached for comment.\n  espn ,  john kruk ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:27:12.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
