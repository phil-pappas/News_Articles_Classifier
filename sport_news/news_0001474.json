A 47-yard rushing touchdown on the first play from Fayette quarterback Kaden Hoover, and an onside kick recovery led to Hoover breaking free on a 37-yard run to the end zone with less than 10-seconds remaining to push the Falcons score to 34-18 at intermission. From here, Fayette tacked on two more scores in the third quarter en route to a 48-18 victory Friday over Salisbury in the Class 1 District 6 football opener. Fayette (4-6) will play Marceline (9-1), the No. 3 team in Class 1, next week in the district semifinals. Salisbury, who also lost to the Falcons 35-7 in Week 8, ended its 2015 season with a 3-7 record under second year head coach Mitchell Green. Hoover, a sophomore, carried the football 11 times for 206 yards and five touchdowns. Fayette junior Ahmed Chairse had 78 rushing yards and a score, while freshman Isaiah Estes ran for 77 yards and one touchdown. For Salisbury, junior quarterback Francis threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Jeremiah Gebhardt in the second quarter, and senior Cory Hinkle scored on an 8-yard run in the first period.
