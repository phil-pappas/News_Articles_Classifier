Arizona currently ranks 106th nationally in scoring defense, surrendering more than 35 points per game, and 103rd in passing defense (260.6 yards allowed per game) and 97th in rushing defense (192.6 yards allowed per game). It also does not help that star linebacker Scooby Wright has missed much of the season with a foot injury and is not expected to play Saturday against OSU, while starting quarterback Anu Solomon missed the Stanford game with a concussion. \nStar power: Running back Nick Wilson ranks 13th nationally in rushing yards (605) and has scored six touchdowns. Should Solomon not play against the Beavers, redshirt senior Jerrard Randall will again get the start. The dual-threat signal-caller, who totaled 178 passing yards and 67 rushing yards against Stanford, began his career at LSU before transferring to Northeast Mississippi Community College and then Arizona. Receivers Johnny Jackson and David Richards have both tallied more than 230 receiving yards and four touchdowns apiece. Safety Will Parks leads the Wildcats with 36 tackles (two for loss), four pass breakups and two forced fumbles, while fellow safety Telles Jones has added 25 stops (4.5 for loss), 1.5 sacks and a forced fumble. \nDid you know: OSU has won six consecutive games in Tucson, including a 38-35 comeback thriller in their last meeting with the Wildcats in 2012. \nThreat level (1-5 scale): 3. The Wildcats certainly look vulnerable, given their struggles with injuries and their recent performances against quality competition. Can the Beavers' offense -- which has shown signs of progressing with true freshman quarterback Seth Collins -- take advantage of a reeling Arizona defense? Until this young OSU squad proves it can go into a tough road environment (don't forget it'll still be pushing 100 degrees on the field for a 1 p.m. kickoff) and win, it's difficult to pick the Beavers. So still give the edge to the Wildcats -- barely. \nEarly prediction: Arizona 27, OSU 24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:47:32.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
