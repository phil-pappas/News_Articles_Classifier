Rather, I'm curious as to where everyone stands with Mark Richt. There is a lot of banter about whether or not we can win a National Championship, or even another SEC Championship with CMR. Some are vehement in their defense of CMR, while other are firmly against him continuing to coach the Dawgs. Others still are in the middle. I'm just wondering if all the arguments make an impact at all or if nearly everyone is firmly in their own camp. I think it is important to remember that we are all part of the Bulldog family and disagreeing is healthy and necessary. We all want our team to succeed, but feel there are different levels of success and the means to achieving those goals. I have a poll attached to this article if you'd like to answer. In the meantime, I'd like to address some of the reasons people state for keeping the status quo as they each have merits. Am I only doing this because we lost a game? Absolutely not. I'm bringing this up as we got boat-raced by what appears to be a very good team. The problem isn't losing a game to a great opponent, but we have a way of getting flat out embarrassed in these types of games seemingly every year: \nSON, STUPID IS WHAT STUPID DOES, AND YOU SON IS STUPID. COACH RICHT HAS A 74% WINNING PERCENTAGE... \n...that he does. You don't stay at the same school for 15 years with a mediocre or bad record. With a 9 - 5 bowl record and 2 - 3 SEC CG record, that leaves Mark Richt 129 - 41 during the regular season, just shy of a 76% clip. To keep the math easy, that is roughly nine wins a year. Let's assume in most years that the program can win five games on talent alone...you could put Donald Trump on the sideline and we would still win five games. That requires we win four of the final seven games to finish with a 75% winning percentage. Those games include USCe, Florida, Tennessee, Auburn, GT, Missouri, and a rotating West opponent. Do we have more talent that at least four of these teams every year...I'd say yes. If you disagree that this wasn't the case in 2010, I would concur, but I'd also say there has been more than one year that we have had more talent than all of our opponents. Long story short, we are averaging a 57% win percentage on the part of the schedule that we can realistically lose games; not exactly the definition of mediocrity, but pretty close. In comparison, Donnan was fired with a 68% winning percentage and rightfully so as he was abysmal against our rivals. No question that Richt has been superb against Auburn and GT, very good against Tennessee, and good against South Carolina. Only Florida has really done well against Richt despite their rotating carousel of coaches. My point is that the winning percentage itself is not very telling and, as I have illustrated, you can make the numbers work for your argument. \nBUT A LOT OF COACHES HAVE SUCCESS BUT DON'T WIN THE BIG ONE... \n...there are a number of coaches who have had success similar to Richt, but not many who haven't won it all. I looked at all the coaches that have been head coaches for at least six-years and have over a 70% winning percentage. These include Urban Meyer, Jimbo Fisher, Chris Petersen, Bob Stoops, Nick Saban, Gary Patterson, Brian Kelly, Les Miles, Steve Spurrier, and Bobby Petrino. Six of these coaches have won at least one National Championship, one has appeared in the big game, and Petersen just joined a Power 5 conference after a very long tenure at Boise State. That leaves only Patterson and Petrino with comparable careers to Richt...and Patterson also has not been long in the Power 5. Now, I am not discussing the merits of these coaches as human beings, but rather Richt's contemporaries that show similar winning percentages with a significant amount of time as a head coach. \nPOPPYCOCK, YOU ARE AGAIN MAKING THE NUMBERS WORK FOR YOU. IT TOOK A LOT OF GREAT COACHES FOREVER TO WIN THEIR FIRST NC... \n...the game has changed. I just listed coaches with a 70% or better winning percentage. If you want coaches that have stayed with their school for 10 years or longer and not won a National Championship...Bronco Mendenhall (BYU), Paul Johnson (GT), Mike Gundy (Oklahoma State), Frank Beamer (VT), Gary Pinkel (Missouri), George O'Leary (UCF), Kirk Ferentz (Iowa), and Pat Fitzgerald (Northwestern). Not exactly your usual suspects when discussing pre-season college football and Championships. \nBOY, NUMBERS DON'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. NEXT, YOU WILL BE BRINGING THOSE ARBITRARY RANKED TEAMS INTO THE ARGUMENT... \n...no doubt about it. CMR brings a lot of intangibles to the program as a whole and you would have a tough time finding a better representation for your University or even as a human being, but I'm talking on-field results. And yes, I'm going to discuss rankings (at the time the game was played). You have to take rankings with a million grains of sand, but there is substance to them. Richt is 38 - 35 against ranked teams, just a tick over 50%. Against non-ranked opponents, he is 102 - 14, a whopping 88%! \nIT SOUNDS LIKE RICHT IS WINNING THE ONES HE SHOULD WIN AND HOLDING HIS OWN AGAINST THE GOOD COMPETITION... \n...err, well, kinda, maybe, he used to...not so much anymore. To be honest, I expect more than 50% against ranked opponents, but that is clearly opinion. Coach Richt took over a struggling program in 2001 and from that point though the end of 2007, Coach Richt went 72 - 19, nearly an 80% winning percentage. His record against ranked opponents started 24 - 14, a very respectable 63%. Since then? 68 - 30 overall (69%) and 14 - 21 against ranked opponents (40%). \nBUT BAMA MAKES EVERYONE LOOK BAD... \n...they sure do, but other teams have found ways to beat them. Whether you believe by fortuitous turnovers, a miracle kick 6, Bama not wanting to be in their specific Bowl, Bama being a year off from prime-time...whatever your reasons for other teams' success, Bama has still lost to Ole Miss, Auburn, LSU, Oklahoma, and Ohio State. The two times we have been favored over Bama we were handed a 31 - 0 halftime score in 2008 and a 38 - 10 final last Saturday. Not all losses are created equal, and let's face it, we have had some really bad losses not limited to Alabama. \nDO YOU REALLY WANT TO GO BACK TO THE YEARS BETWEEN DOOLEY AND RICHT? HAVE YOU SEEN TENNESSEE AND TEXAS RECENTLY? I HAVE MORE EXAMPLES IF YOU NEED THEM... \nI don't want to go back to the dark days and I have seen the plight of other once-proud programs. But more than anything, I don't want to settle for being \"good\" any longer. I want 70-X Takeoff. I want the hobnail boot. I want the blackout (2007 underdog version, not 2008 pasting). I want SEC Championships. What I don't want are 38 - 10 blowouts at home. I don't want to give up 400 yards of rushing to one of the worst Florida teams ever. I don't want to use squib kicks at the end of a game we are winning. This only goes back a year. I also don't want losses to Vandy (ever and regardless of excuses). I don't want to inexplicably see my team get embarrassed on national television seemingly every year. I don't want to see games where our team fails to get off the bus. I don't want us to continue to lose a game every single year by 14 points or more (10 years running). \nMany of us have become very adept at justifying why certain losses happen. We always come back optimistic the following year. When was the last time you looked across the sideline and saw a team as talented as ours that resulted in a W? When was the last time we won a game we weren't expected to win? \nFor the rest of the season, we won't come close to seeing another team like Alabama unless we meet them in the SECCG. How will you feel if Tennessee gets their \"signature\" win against us on Saturday? How will you feel if Florida beats us down in Jacksonville and wins the SEC East with their first year coach? How will you feel if we inexplicably lose a game we shouldn't this year? Does Richt deserve to go out on his own terms regardless of on-field performance? Does his representation of the University supersede the on-field results? Is there a goal Richt must reach to maintain your support? \nIn the meantime, I'm hoping we take out our frustrations at Rocky Top. Go Dawgs! Poll How is your current relationship with Coach Richt. You're my boy Blue! We've had some bad luck, but Richt will get us there. I'm sticking with CMR as I'm not confident I will find someone better. I'm sticking with \"good\" though I doubt we will ever be \"great\". It's not you, it's me. I thought you were the one, but barring a superb finish, time to look at other options. It's definitely you Coach. I've seen enough. Let's move on. vote", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:52:02.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
