How much longer can they keep it up? The Washington Post 19 hrs ago Adam Kilgore The worst part about the Denver Broncos is their quarterback, which is a strange thing to say because their quarterback is Peyton Manning. He’s spent most his career carrying teams. This year the Broncos have lugged him to a 5-0 record. They have spectacular wide receivers, a fierce pass rush and a bullying, ball-hawking secondary. Their defense is definitely good enough to win a Super Bowl. The question is whether or not Manning is.\nAdChoices The Broncos scratched out another win Sunday, sealing a 16-10 victory over the Oakland Raiders when cornerback Chris Harris returned an interception with about seven minutes left in the fourth quarter. The Raiders had been driving across midfield, and they were nearly in range of a potential go-ahead field goal. They remained in the game so late because Manning’s offense failed to produce a touchdown. They managed only three field goals and had three points at halftime.\nBOX SCORE: BRONCOS 16, RAIDERS 10\nSunday, against an on-the-come Raiders defense, Manning completed 22 of 35 passes for 266 yards and threw two more interceptions — bringing his season total to seven, compared to six touchdown passes, through five games.\nIt is plainly, painfully obvious that Manning no longer possesses the necessary arm strength to play NFL quarterback. You can see it when he throws moderately deep passes — he has to put so much air on the ball, he is essentially guessing at where his intended receiver will end up when the ball flutters down. You can see it in the numbers — entering the week, Manning ranked as the 30th-best quarterback in the NFL according to the rankings at Pro Football Focus, slotting him between Jimmy Clausen and Johnny Manziel.\nIt is admirable and amazing that Manning is even that good. There is a minimum threshold of physical ability required to play NFL quarterback. Manning had approached the line for years, and this year he has dipped below it. His genius at deciphering defenses and rearranging teammates allows Manning to acquit himself. But that is the kindest way to describe him. He can guide the offense and is usually not a detriment.\nWATCH: Charles Woodson picks off Peyton Manning for 1st time\nHis receivers help, too, because they are both excellent and perfect in type for a quarterback with a weak arm. Demaryius Thomas can — and must — rip passes out of the air like a power forward rebounding. Emmanuel Sanders provides Manning the other type of target he needs, a jitterbug who can get open just a few yards off the line of scrimmage.\nBut there are times Manning needs to make plays with his arm, and almost always he cannot, especially near the goal line. Before half on Sunday, in the red zone, Manning needed to thread a pass into a small window over the middle. The ball quivered and wobbled, and Charles Woodson sliced in front of tight end Owen Daniels and snared an interception in the end zone.\nManning’s deficiencies will only become more of a drain for Denver. Defenses will begin to creep closer toward the line of scrimmage, unafraid of Manning throwing it over their heads, and further stifle the Broncos already shaky running game.\nThe cold weather and biting wind of the late figures to exacerbate Manning’s glaring flaws, too. Last year, the Broncos collapsed in the playoffs as Manning’s passes missed open receivers, often running deep down the sideline on patterns that demand zip on the ball. The Broncos went 12-4, and then went out with a whimper, not despite Manning, but because of him.\nManning’s boss, Broncos czar John Elway, provided the best-case scenario for how an all-time quarterback can leave on top. Leaning on a stout defense and running back Terrell Davis, Elway won Super Bowls at age 37 and 38 before he retired. Many have pointed to Elway as a blueprint for Manning. But Elway possessed a rocket arm and athleticism until the end. Try to imagine Manning helicoptering through the air, like Elway in the Super Bowl against the Packers.\nNo matter how the Broncos’ season plays out, Manning will retain his standing as one of the best player in the history of the league. His toughness and his intelligence are allowing him play NFL quarterback at age 39, without full feeling in his fingers because of the neck surgery he underwent three years ago. His past is certain. His immediate future, along with the fate of the excellent team around him, is anything but.\n© Provided by Washington Post\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfl9k3.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAyrb0&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;CineSport’s", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Eagles", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfla0i.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfgrw2.img&quot;}}", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Colts", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Broncos", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfgmnR.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:07:19.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
