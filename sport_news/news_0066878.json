Tom Worgo Contact Reporter Severn soccer blanks St. Paul's School for Girls in a non-league IAAM game. \nSevern School simply had too much of too many things as the Admirals put away visiting St. Paul’s School for Girls, 4-0, Saturday. \nFour players scored for Severn, two in each half in the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association non-league game. \nThe back-breaker as far as St. Paul’s assistant coach Joe Ciattei was concerned came early in the second half. \nWith the visiting Gators — who play in the B Conference — pressuring Severn after a lackluster first half, Sarah Frisch hit the crossbar about five minutes into the period. \nSoon after that, Severn’s Mackenzie Dixon scored on a crossing pass from Danielle Drury from about five yards out to give the Admirals a 3-0 cushion. \nCiattei knows trying to stay with Severn, which competes in the A Conference, is tough enough. soccer \nBut doing it with three of his top players missing, including freshmen Zari Hayes and Sophie Hussain and junior Gabbey Pirsino, made things that much more difficult for the Gators (6-4). \nThe three club players are away on trips to New Jersey and Virginia for college showcase tournaments. \n“Having the other girls here would have really helped,” said Ciattei, who is filling in head coach for Joie McLaughlin. “I am not saying we would have won by any stretch, but maybe it would have been closer.” \nCenter midfielder Liza Liotta also missed the game. \n“I could have played her, but I sat her because we have three conference games next week,” Ciattei said of a stretch that includes league leader Roland Park and second-place St. Mary’s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:57:20.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
