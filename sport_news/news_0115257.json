BYU swimmers dive into the water during the Blue vs. White scrimmage on Sept. 19. Kelly Hatanaka and Ranier Ng both won MPSF Athlete of the Week following the meet at Colorado Mesa. (Maddi Dayton) \nThe BYU men’s and women’s swim and dive teams each had one swimmer named as the Mountain Pacific Sport Federation/Turbo Athlete of the Week following the Colorado Mesa Invite on Oct. 9 and 10. \nJunior Ranier Ng of the men’s team took first in both the 100- and 200-yard butterfly events. He finished with times of 49.32 and 1:49.59 respectively. Ng’s performance in the 200-yard butterfly set a pool record. He also placed third in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 50.33. Ng will help the men’s team defend it MPSF title as they look to take home their third straight. \nFreshman Kelly Hatanaka placed first in the 400-yard individual medley with a time of 4:31.05 and first in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 5:09.55. The Colorado Mesa Invite was Hatanaka’s first collegiate competition and she excelled.
