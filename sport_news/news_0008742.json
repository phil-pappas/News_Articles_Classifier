The Mean Green can't afford many more setbacks at this point heading into a game today against Southern Miss on the road, where UNT has struggled mightily over the last two seasons.\n\"It's vital to not go down 0-2 in conference play,\" quarterback Andrew McNulty said. \"We have already lost one, need to get a conference win and let things progress from there.\"\nUNT's hope is that once it can grab that first win, its season will start to roll in the right direction.\nThe Mean Green will strive to reach that goal today while playing on the road, a situation UNT has not fared well with since the beginning of last season.\nThe Mean Green lost all six of their road games a year ago and saw their road losing streak extend to eight games last week when it fell at Iowa.\n\"There really isn't anything to do differently on the road,\" UNT coach Dan McCarney said. \"If you have a good football team with good players, good coaches and a good system and play with confidence, then you have a chance to win. If you go back through it, we have lost to some darn good football teams on the road.\"\nIowa was one. The Hawkeyes hammered UNT 62-16 last week.\nSouthern Miss might not be the household name Iowa is, but the Golden Eagles certainly appear as if they will present a sizable challenge.\nJust last week, Southern Miss took Nebraska to the wire behind Nick Mullens. The Golden Eagles' quarterback threw for a career high 447 yards against the Huskers.\nMullens is in his third year as a starter and has thrown for more than 5,600 yards in his career.\n\"It's the experience that makes Mullens so good,\" UNT cornerback Chad Davis said. \"He has been there a few years and has taken his lumps. Now he is comfortable in the offense and has been playing with the same receivers.\"\nUNT is hoping to keep Mullens off the field by getting its running game rolling. The Mean Green rushed for 183 yards against an Iowa defense that was allowing just 51 yards a game on the ground.\nSophomore Jeffrey Wilson rushed for 74 yards to spark the Mean Green, who are hoping to break through on the road and pick up their first win of the year at a time UNT needs to turn its season around.\n\"It's tough to win on the road,\" UNT center Kaydon Kirby said. \"That is something we need to work on and try to get going. We need that road win.\"\nNorth Texas (0-3, 0-1 C-USA) at Southern Miss (2-2, 0-0 C-USA), 6 p.m. today, Fox College Sports\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:19:33.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
