Alabama erased a 7-3 deficit late in the third quarter on an 81-yard pass from quarterback Jake Coker to wide receiver Calvin Ridley, a play that awoke a slumbering offense that had struggled to finish drives most of the game to that point. That score, with 1:39 left in the third period, turned the game in Alabama's favor as the Crimson Tide stopped an Arkansas drive at the Hogs' 43 on the ensuing possession and marched to a touchdown on a 3-yard pass from Coker to wideout Richard Mullaney for a 17-7 lead. After an Eddie Jackson interception for the Tide a few plays later, Alabama tacked on a 35-yard Adam Griffith field goal for a 20-7 edge with 10:07 left in the fourth quarter. Derrick Henry added a 1-yard touchdown run with 2:44 left, marking the 11th consecutive game in which he has scored on the ground, to give the Tide the final 27-7 victory margin. Arkansas' first touchdown came in the second quarter on a four-yard pass by quarterback Brandon Allen to wide receiver Drew Morgan after the Hogs took possession at the Tide 12 following an interception. Arkansas added a late 54-yard touchdown pass by Allen to wide receiver Dominique Reed with 1:37 left in the game. Led by linebacker Reggie Ragland's eight tackles (seven solos), Alabama's defensive was unyielding, allowing only 220 total yards to the Razorbacks (176 passing, 44 rushing) while allowing just 1.8 yards per rush. Ragland also had one quarterback sack, broke up a pass, had two quarterback hurries and forced a fumble. The Tide offense gained 396 total yards, including 134 on the ground against one of the nation's top rushing defenses. Coker completed 24 of 33 passes for 262 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions. Ridley caught nine passes for 140 yards and a touchdown. Henry rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. Alabama punter JK Scott averaged 50.0 yards per punt on four attempts, placing two inside the Arkansas 20-yard line. Katelyn Katsafanas was honored as the 2015 Homecoming Queen during halftime of Saturdayâ€™s Alabama Homecoming game against Arkansas, as the Crimson Tide honored a number of people associated with the celebration. Katsafanas was crowned by 2014 Homecoming Queen Allison Montgomery and Alabama Governor Robert Bentley. Alabama continues its season next Saturday, October 17 , against Texas A&M (5-0 overall; 2-0 in the SEC) at Kyle Field in College Station, Texas. Kickoff is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. Central Time and the game will be televised by CBS Sports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:18:26.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
