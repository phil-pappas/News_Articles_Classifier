Haggen took over the Baker City store from Albertsons in mid May. But earlier this month Haggen announced that it plans to close most of its newly acquired stores, including the Baker City outlet. Smith said Tuesday that he has been “working diligently” to set up a meeting with officials from WinCo Foods, which is based in Nampa, Idaho. “I think WinCo would be a great fit for Baker City and would be well-accepted by the community,” Smith said. Julee Hicks, who works with Smith in the Economic Development Department, said this morning that WinCo officials called the department Tuesday. Although they declined to schedule a meeting with Smith, the company “might have some interest in Baker City,” Hicks said. “We have an open line of communication with them,” she said. Smith said he also plans to discuss options with Grocery Outlet, which has stores in La Grande, Pendleton and Ontario. \nSmith said he’s not sure whether Grocery Outlet would be interested in the Haggen store or possibly a different location in Baker City. \nSee more in Wednesday's issue of the Baker City Herald.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:23:38.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
