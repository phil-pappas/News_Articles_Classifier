They had to do something stupid. As Julian Edelman put it when asked about Indianapolis’ ill-advised fake punt: “Shame on them for trying that again. You know you’re not surprised with anything how they play. You know, Colts.”\nIn other words, “You know, desperate housewives.”\nTrailing by only six points late in the third quarter, the Colts did what they so often do against the Patriots. They panicked and made beating them easier. Do that against Tom Brady, and you’re going down, which Indy did for the fifth straight time in this rivalry since Andrew Luck arrived.\nQUARTERBACK\nA-minus\nStatistically, this wasn’t Tom Brady’s finest hour, but he deserves high marks for the way he moved in the pocket, often buying time for his depleted offensive line. The Colts put a lot of pressure on him, but he delivered accurate throws despite being chased off his spot. Brady’s shoulder fake froze the Colts secondary just long enough to loft a 39-yard completion to Keshawn Martin early. Late in the second quarter, he was flushed from the pocket but stepped up, his movement allowing Danny Amendola to create space on a 35-yard reception. He did have several passes tipped at the line and was the victim of a batted one by Julian Edelman for his first interception of the year, a pick-six that originally was on target. But his legs created an opening for LeGarrette Blount’s 11-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter, buying time in the pocket and then rolling right as the running back followed him on a parallel line, Brady putting the ball on the money for an easy score. He even made a good play while being sacked by safety Dwight Lowery on a blitz. Brady knew there was no one to block Lowery and wanted to go to Rob Gronkowski on a shallow cross, but at the last moment, the tight end was jammed by linebacker D’Qwell Jackson. Brady wisely took the sack rather than risk a hurried throw. This was a night he won more with his head and feet than his arm.\nRUNNING BACK\nB-plus\nDion Lewis had become a staple in the backfield but was all but invisible as LeGarrette Blount did the heavy lifting with 93 rushing yards, including a 38-yard touchdown burst on which he showed great acceleration through a massive hole on the right side. Blount also bounced off a pile of humanity at the line and stepped inside for an 11-yard gain that was all about vision. Credit him with a sound blitz pick-up on D’Qwell Jackson at the Patriots 10-yard line as well. Blount’s TD catch was easy money partly because he gave Tom Brady an easy target by drifting with him once linebacker Jerrell Freeman bolted off in pursuit of the quarterback. Lewis’ time was limited, but he made it count, taking a screen for 12 yards that was doubled when he was hauled down by his face mask. Later, with the Pats facing third-and-6, Lewis made a nifty run for 7 by bouncing left then cutting back through a small crease. Good day’s work all around.\nWIDE RECEIVER\nB-minus\nThis was Danny Amendola’s night. He hauled in seven of the nine balls aimed at him for 105 yards and two long gains. His 35-yard out-and-up route on a slow developing play read the zone perfectly as Tom Brady bought him time to get free. Julian Edelman was playing with an injured finger that might have explained three dropped passes and another he batted into a Mike Adams pick-six. The finger must have been an issue because the passes were on point. He ran a fine route between linebackers, avoiding an attempted jam by Robert Mathis coming out of the slot and finding open space on his 11-yard touchdown. We could have done without his spike into the Colts logo, but that’s Edelman. One day, somebody is going to spike him. Edelman also made an agile spin that shook off Mathis on a fourth-and-1 sweep and gained 2 yards. Keshawn Martin’s 39-yard catch wasn’t his only contribution. He also drew an interference call on a fade route that had Greg Toler holding on, putting the ball on the Colts 7.\nTIGHT END\nC-minus\nIt was a below-average night for Rob Gronkowski, who often was jammed by a defensive end or linebacker and seldom left one-on-one. Because the method held him to just three second-half catches, Gronk can expect to see more of that. His blocking wasn’t super effective, either. He was unable to maintain his leverage several times. The Colts had safety Dwight Lowery on him much of the game, but someone else usually had a hand or a body on him first. The few times he was out wide and one-on-one, he won the battles, including his touchdown. Scott Chandler averaged 19.5 yards on two catches because the emphasis was on Gronk. Chandler made a tough catch of a high throw from Tom Brady for 25 yards. He also got away with a nice hold on LeGarrette Blount’s 38-yard TD run. Mike Williams’ blocking was spottier than usual. He couldn’t hold his block on nose tackle David Parry, resulting in LeGarrette Blount being stuffed for 1 yard.\nOFFENSIVE LINE\nB-minus\nConsidering the line lost two left tackles — Nate Solder (torn biceps) and Marcus Cannon (toe) — this was a fairly solid performance. One of the two sacks allowed was of the coverage variety. While the six hits on Tom Brady and the consistent pressure are concerning (especially with the Jets coming to town), the Pats ran the ball effectively and did a better job in the second half once the linemen became accustomed to their spots. The upside is the kids in the middle kept a solid enough pocket that Brady usually was able to step up to avoid outside rushers, the two glaring exceptions being when T.Y. McGill beat guard Shaq Mason clean inside and forced an incompletion, and when center David Andrews missed Billy Winn and got the quarterback leveled. Sebastian Vollmer is one of the league’s best right tackles but had to move to the left side with Solder done for the season and Cannon limping. Ex-practice squad denizen Cameron Fleming stepped in for Cannon and held his own without holding the Colts. The line continued to pull effectively and get out in front of screens. The Pats averaged 4.6 yards per carry, which is effective.\nDEFENSIVE LINE\nB-plus\nGood or bad, it starts up front, and Sunday night was pretty good. Three sacks and 10 hits on Andrew Luck forced the quarterback into too many off-target throws. End Chandler Jones finished with 21⁄2 sacks and four hits on Luck. He owned tackle Anthony Castonzo, forcing him into two holding calls and tormenting him with speed rushes. One of those holds came on third-and-14 and erased a 16-yard completion. Those plays change games. Jones also sacked Luck with a looping stunt inside on third-and-7, coming up the middle untouched. Dominique Easley had four hits and created a sack for his linemate by overwhelming his blocker and forcing Luck into Jones. Easley showed flashes that make you want to see more of him against the run and chasing the QB. The group lost containment on Luck several times, once on a third down when he ran for 25 yards. The line also was gashed by running back Frank Gore a few times and will need to clean that up against Chris Ivory on Sunday, but the defense forced the Colts into four punts and two turnovers on the first six drives of the second half.\nLINEBACKER\nB\nJamie Collins was a beast again. He is stout against the run because his sense of anticipation gets him into the right gap before the back gets there. His athleticism was evident in coverage and most definitely when he jumped over the long snapper and blocked an extra point . . . with his hip! Dont’a Hightower’s absence was felt, especially in the run game. Frank Gore averaged 6 yards per rush, and Jonathan Freeny, who started in place of Hightower, often missed him. Freeny had trouble covering Gore in the flat, was blown out by center Khaled Holmes on a 23-yard run up the middle and reacted too slowly on one coverage, resulting in a big T.Y. Hilton gain. He did nearly make a diving interception, but when he was sent on a blitz, he got stoned by Gore in the backfield. Jerod Mayo saw more action than usual, but he reminded you of an old fighter who still sees openings but can’t hit them. It’s hard to play inside linebacker in this defense and not make a tackle.\nDEFENSIVE BACK\nB\nMalcolm Butler was beaten for a touchdown on a fade to Donte Moncrief, but his coverage was tight. He made several nice open-field tackles and nearly had an interception when he was all over Griff Whalen, but he also overran Moncrief on a crossing route and missed the tackle. Logan Ryan had good and bad moments. He played a screen pass to Gore perfectly, taking him down with a marvelous ankle tackle for a short gain, but he lost T.Y. Hilton on his 3-yard TD catch. Ryan should be called Halloween. It’s trick or treat with him. Safety Devin McCourty got his first penalty in two years, using an arm bar to push speedster Phillip Dorsett out of bounds. That wasn’t a good matchup. Whalen also beat him to the post by a step for an 18-yard TD, but his coverage overall was sound. Playing more zone than usual eased problems with crossing routes but too often left big gaps. That’s how Andrew Luck had 312 passing yards and three scores despite being under a lot of heat. If they played safety Duron Harmon any deeper, he’d have to pay for a seat but at least it keeps him out of harm’s way and, to be fair, has limited throws over the top.\nSPECIAL TEAMS\nB-plus\nThe Pats were not fooled by the Colts’ fake punt attempt, Brandon Bolden stuffing it for a yard loss to give the offense the ball at the Indy 35. They also recovered two onside kicks, although replays showed everyone (except referee Tony Corrente) Josh Kline lost his. Stephen Gostkowski was 2-for-2 on field goals and had six touchbacks, with his seventh kickoff brought from 6 yards deep to the Colts 11. That’s a field-position win. Punter Ryan Allen hasn’t had many opportunities, but he averaged 44.8 yards and dropped two inside the 20. He also had one partially blocked. While the kickoff and punt coverage teams were solid, the punt return unit was not. Julian Edelman’s 36-yard return was negated by a senseless Devin McCourty block in the back. Edelman’s 11-yarder was negated by a penalty for blocking above the waist on Brandon King. Not good.\nCOACHING\nB\nThe early defensive plan was not effective, with the Colts riddling the Pats’ man coverage on crossing routes, but adjustments were made to use more zone and alter some calls when in man in the second half. That stymied Luck for much of the final 30 minutes. Offensively, the Pats couldn’t figure out how to get Rob Gronkowski free most of the game but did get him one-on-one for his TD catch. Indy didn’t let that happen often, and the Pats had no consistent counter. The preparedness of the special teams speaks to Joe Judge’s work and his players’ controlled response to whatever Indy tried to do to baffle them. And offensive line coach Dave DeGuglielmo once again mixed and matched his battered group well enough to get control of things after some shaky early moments.\nHEAD OF THE CLASS\nTom Brady : He made the plays when the plays needed to be made.\nJamie Collins: He hurdled the Colts line like Edwin Moses on the way to blocking an extra point.\nJoe Judge: His special teams unit played smart even when the Colts got stupid.\nBACK OF THE PACK\nJulian Edelman: His batted ball became a Colts pick-six.\nChuck Pagano: Fake punt call was so bad it can’t be ignored, even if it happened on the other sideline.\nMarcus Cannon: You hurt your toe?
