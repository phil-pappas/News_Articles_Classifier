In Kansas City Friday night, the Royals and Blue Jays will continue their American League Championship Series. The Royals hold a 3-2 lead and a winner may not be crowned until Saturday night.\nIn the meanwhile, the Mets will continue to wait. It is their gift and curse. They demolished the Cubs so easily and quickly, sweeping them in four games in the National League Championship Series, that they will have five whole days to rest before Game 1 of the World Series.\nAlready, manager Terry Collins understands that it will present a risk for the Mets. He called around to friends of his in the sport to figure out a way to deal with it.\n\"The general response I got, nothing you can do about it,\" he said. \"No matter how hard you try, pipe in loud noise, try to have simulated games.\"\nThe time off could be a detriment. The history is not in the Mets favor.\nRELATED: Why Mets' Yoenis Cespedes missed Friday's workout The team that has had fewer days off leading up to the World Series has won nine times over the last 15 years. In the last nine years, only the 2008 Phillies won the title with more time off than their opponent.\nFor the Mets, it does not get better. Nine teams in the last 15 years have had at least five days off leading into the World Series and not faced another foe with as much rest, as the Mets find themselves. Just two of those teams ended up winning the World Series.\nOf course, that information is hardly dispositive. From 2001 to 2004, the team with less rest won the World Series each time. And the sample size isn't huge.\n\"I think you have to treat it as it is what it is,\" Kelly Johnson said.\n\"We even talked about making sure we have the motivation as the season got to the point where we clinched the division to continue with the motivation to play in the playoffs because it did seem like some wild card teams and teams that had played tough games and continued to play seemed to always get there. But we're fortunate to have taken care of our business quick and to be honest with you it helps the guys that are banged up, it helps the rotation, so I think we just take the positives and look at those.\"\nInside the Mets champagne clubhouse celebration The New York Mets celebrate their NLCS sweep of the Chicago Cubs with champagne. (Video by John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)\nCollins has explored his options. He believes the rest will help his pitching staff , which he saw fatiguing by the end of the NLCS.\nHe called Jim Leyland, his friend and former Tigers manager, and asked him what he did in Detroit when he made the World Series in 2006 and 2012. In 2006, the Tigers waited for seven days from the end of the ALCS to the start of the World Series. In 2012 it was six days. Both times their opponents were on the field two days after advancing and both times the Tigers lost.\n\"I think he had the better team at the time but the team that's playing the best is the team that wins and we got to get ourselves ready to play,\" Collins said Leyland told him.\n\"He told me: Play the best players, don't ever take anything for granted, and by the way there's nothing you can do between now and the game starts that's going to get them ready except themselves. You can't simulate a game. You can't simulate 46,000 people in here, the flag waving, the pressure of 3-2 and the bases loaded. Just go about your job and make sure guys are prepared and that's all you can do.\"\nLeyland tried bringing the Tigers' instructional league team to Detroit to be a live opponent. It didn't work. He felt Detroit was still too flat and careless.\nWhen Sandy Alderson was the general manager in Oakland, he took the A's to Arizona to face the organization's instructional league there in 1989 and Collins believes it was more beneficial because there was a crowd.\nThe Mets will have two more workouts at Citi Field. Saturday and Sunday, the manager said, the hitters will take live batting practice off their pitchers and stick to their normal routine.\n\"That's the only way you can prepare,\" Collins said.\nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com .
