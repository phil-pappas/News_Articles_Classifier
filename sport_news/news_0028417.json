Real Madrid lead Barca on goal difference at the top of the table after Cristiano Ronaldo became the Spanish giants’ all-time leading scorer in a comfortable 3-0 win over Levante earlier on Saturday. Javi Guerra had given Rayo a shock lead at the Camp Nou, but Neymar twice converted from the penalty spot after he had been brought down to give the hosts a halftime lead. The Brazilian then struck twice in a minute after the break and teed up Luis Suarez to rifle home a fifth before Jozabed pulled a goal back for Rayo as Barca got back to winning ways after a 2-1 defeat at Sevilla last time out. “I’m very happy for the victory and how we played. Everyone deserves congratulations,” Neymar said. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:11:27.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
