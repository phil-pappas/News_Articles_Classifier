They knew the Giants history of fourth-quarter collapses this season.\nBut on the ensuing kickoff, the Giants’ Dwayne Harris caught the ball at the goal line and raced untouched 100 yards for a touchdown. It was the Giants first kickoff return for a touchdown since 2012, and Harris’s 100-yard dash tied the franchise record for the longest kickoff return set by Clarence Childs in 1964.\nThe crowd was alive again, cheering all the way until the final seconds of a 27-20 Giants victory.\nIn the game’s final minutes, the Cowboys threatened to tie the game, but the Giants defense, which had been on the field for far too long Sunday, rose up to stop Dallas deep in Giants territory. The Cowboys were about to get the football back with about 85 seconds remaining, but Cole Beasley muffed a Giants punt and the Giants’ Myles Beasley recovered the ball at the Cowboys’ 16-yard line.\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nFor the Giants (4-3), the victory snaps a four-game losing streak to the Cowboys (2-4). It was also a much-needed win at home as the Giants next two games are on the road against New Orleans and Tampa Bay.\nTaking over at their own 20-yard line in the fourth quarter, with the Giants leading by a touchdown, the Cowboys marched into the Giants’ end of the field. Two remarkable catches allowed the Cowboys to tie the game.\nOn a third down and 9, the Giants flushed Dallas quarterback Matt Cassel out of the pocket, but he threw on the run toward wide receiver Terrance Williams, who caught the high pass along the sideline and just got both feet in bounds for a 21-yard gain.\nOn the next play, Cassel was again pressured out of the pocket, and he pointed at wide receiver Devin Street, directing him to head to the right corner of the end zone.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story With Giants defensive end George Selvie about to knock him to the ground, Cassel threw over the heads of multiple Giants defenders. Street caught the ball, touching both feet on the ground inches from the sideline for a 25-yard touchdown pass that tied the game, 20-20.\nTrailing by three points at the half, the Giants forced Cassel into three interceptions that directly led to two scores and allowed the Giants to storm into the lead. The first Dallas turnover occurred when Cassel attempted a risky, deep square-out pass to Williams.\nThe pass had to travel a long way across the field, which allowed Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie plenty of time to zero in on it. The pass was also off line and short of its target. Williams fell down trying to get back to it but Rodgers-Cromartie was already closing in and snatched the football out of the air in nearly a full sprint. He easily dashed the remaining 58 yards to the end zone to give the Giants a 17-13 lead.\n It was Rodgers-Cromartie’s sixth career interception return for a touchdown.\nOn the Cowboys next drive, Cassel attempted another ill-advised pass, lofting a long sideline pass into double coverage. Cassel’s pass wobbled and hung in the air. This time Giants safety Brandon Meriweather sized up the errant pass in the air and caught it at the Giants 1-yard line.\nGiants quarterback Eli Manning quickly threw down the right sideline for wide receiver Rueben Randle. With the Cowboys effectively bottling up Beckham, Randle did his best Beckham impersonation, sticking out his right hand to make a spectacular one-handed catch that led to a 44-yard gain.\nFive plays later, Brown kicked a 34-yard field goal for a 20-13 Giants lead.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Cassel was intercepted by Rodgers-Cromartie again. This time, Rodgers-Cromartie snagged a late, wayward pass over the middle. The Giants used that turnover to move to midfield before having to punt.\nDallas opened the scoring on their first drive of the game, dominating with punishing runs up the middle, which played to an unshakable strength of the team — its talented, tenacious offensive line. While much of the pregame attention was focused on Dallas’s decision to bench the starting quarterback Brandon Weeden and replace him with Cassel, it was running back Darren McFadden who led the Cowboys in the opening minutes.\nMcFadden had three consecutive rushing carries that gained 22 yards with the Dallas line dominating a frequently out of position Giants front four. Wide receiver Lucky Whitehead also surprised the Giants defense with a quick run around the left end for 15 yards. The Dallas drive stalled at the Giants 12-yard line, but Dan Bailey kicked a 30-yard field goal to give the Cowboys a 3-0 lead.\nOffensively, the Giants struggled during their early possessions. Manning did not have a secure pocket to throw from and was often on the run as he threw. That led to multiple incompletions and the running game was hardly helping to relieve the pressure on Manning. Rashad Jennings gained eight yards on the game’s first play, but the Giants next four rushing attempts gained only eight yards.\nBut then the Giants’ coaches put the fourth-string running back, Orleans Darkwa into the game. Darkwa displayed a sudden burst through small openings in the line that the Giants have been missing for most of this season. Darkwa gained seven yards on his first carry. The Giants kept handing him the ball, and Darkwa ran for 18 yards in his next two carries. A defensive pass interference helped keep the Giants’ drive alive, and Manning threw to Odell Beckham Jr. for nine yards to move the Giants to the Cowboys 15-yard line.\nDarkwa took a handoff and bulled through the center of the field, breaking three tackles before he dove for the goal line for his second career N.F.L. touchdown.\nDarkwa was signed as a free agent last season after playing four games for the Miami Dolphins. Most of his contributions to the Giants so far have been on special teams.\nThe Cowboys bounced back with a 48-yard Bailey field goal. Dallas then took the lead, moving the ball 72 yards on six plays. Three Giants penalties, two for holding and one for unnecessary roughness, were big assists in the Cowboys drive, which ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by McFadden.\nThe Giants wrapped up the scoring in the first half with a 47-yard field goal by Josh Brown, a score set up by a 38-yard pass from Manning to Dwayne Harris, who broke free over the middle on a crossing route.\nEXTRA POINTS\nGiants defensive end Damontre Moore was not active for Sunday’s game. Moore, who leads the team in sacks, was whistled for a costly unnecessary roughness penalty in the Giants’ previous game, a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n ", "external_links": ["http://a1.nyt.com/assets/article/20151023-153751/images/foundation/logos/"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:50:53.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
