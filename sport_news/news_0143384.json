OK, maybe I got the Gasol family Thanksgiving dinner confused with a scene from \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" but as it turns out, that image might not be too far from the truth.\nAdChoices In an interview with EuropaPress on Wednesday , Marc discussed the possibility of Pau joining forces with him in Memphis as a free agent one day.\n“It’s not impossible that one day we could play together,” said the Grizzlies center as translated by HoopsHype . “I think he has two more years in Chicago, and I think it’s difficult that he would leave the team; I wouldn’t like it. But for us, and for Memphis to add someone like Pau, it would be unbelievable. We will try. Why not?”\nMarc just inked a new five-year, $110 million deal with Memphis over the summer. Meanwhile, Pau does indeed have two years remaining on his deal with the Bulls, but the final year is a player option that he can decline and become a free agent next offseason.\nPau, of course, played the first seven seasons of his career with the Grizzlies, becoming the team’s all-time leading scorer, before being traded to the Lakers for a pu pu platter that included a young Marc. Watching the now-35-year-old Pau play out the final years of his NBA career alongside his brother in Memphis where it all began and retiring in a Grizzlies uniform seems awfully fitting.\nFor what it’s worth, Marc’s current frontcourt mate Zach Randolph comes off the books after the 2016-17 season. With the beautiful big-to-big connection the brothers have fostered playing next to each other for many years in international play for their native Spain, it’s a possibility that would make a lot of sense for both feel-good purposes and basketball purposes alike.\nNow if only Memphis could draft Adria next June…\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.europapress.es/deportes/baloncesto-00163/noticia-marc-gasol-intentaremos-traer-pau-memphis-seria-increible-20150930144219.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://hoopshype.com/rumor/1010881/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:21:23.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
