I think French people really liked this moment,\" Dusautoir said. \n\"We had a great moment eight years ago, another one four years ago in reaching the final. \n\"Maybe, I'm going to a have third special memory to think about. \n\"But If we lose the game against New Zealand we are out of the tournament, and what we are going to do tomorrow is the most important. \n\"Building a future is more important than what has happened in the past. \n\"We are thinking of moving onto the next stage, but you know when you are playing New Zealand you are against one of the best teams in the world. \n\"It is always a big challenge to play New Zealand but we have prepared ourselves for it.\" \nThe Millennium Stadium quarter-final will mark the last time that two back-row greats of the game, Dusautoir and All Blacks captain Richie McCaw, will lock horns after so many tremendous battles over the years. \n\"McCaw is a good player - everybody knows it,\" Dusautoir said. \"He's the best player of his generation and what he did for All Blacks is incredible. \n\"It is always special to play against him. It is the last opportunity and I am going to enjoy it. \n\"It's also really special to play against New Zealand. We have a special history together and we are going to write a new chapter (on Saturday).\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:09:56.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
