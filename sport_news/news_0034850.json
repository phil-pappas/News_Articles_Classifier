After returning to the playoffs last season, the theme of training camp was that one successful season did not guarantee another. On opening night, the Predators started their journey with an imperfect 2-1 win against the Carolina Hurricanes. \n\"That's the biggest thing â€” you want to continue to get better,\" Predators captain Shea Weber said. \"If you play well, more (times) than not, you're going to win, so that's the thing. We didn't play our best. We got two points, and we're going to take it.\" \nThe Predators' aggressiveness immediately returned Thursday as they took the first six shots on goal and held Carolina without one for the first six minutes. The majority of the period was spent in Carolina's defensive zone as Nashville relentlessly attacked, putting 14 shots on Hurricanes goaltender Cam Ward. \nForward Craig Smith was responsible for the Predators' first goal of the season at 2:23, redirecting defenseman Ryan Ellis' shot into the net on the power play. Rookie Viktor Arvidsson, last year's leading scorer for the Predators' minor-league affiliate, added his first career NHL goal with less than three minutes remaining in the period on another deflection in traffic, celebrating the accomplishment on the bench with several animated fist pumps once the goal had been confirmed. \n\"You work your whole life to get to the National Hockey League ... and you're able to score a big goal, so something he'll remember for the rest of his life,\" Predators coach Peter Laviolette said of Arvidsson. \"...This is a kid that works really hard. He worked hard last year and came over (from Sweden) and learned the game and then in his first opportunity tonight, he's able to score a big goal for us.\" \nCarolina gradually chipped away at Nashville's dominance as the game progressed, winning the second period in Laviolette's estimation and ultimately outshooting the Predators 21-11 in the final 40 minutes. Predators' Viktor Arvidsson scores first NHL goal \n\"I think we got a little comfortable after the first period,\" said defenseman Seth Jones, who assisted on both Predators goals. \"We played great hockey in the first, but we let off the gas for sure. We knew they weren't going to give up, but we let off the gas.\" \nThe Predators were 100 seconds from their first home-opening shutout since the 2007-08 season when Hurricanes captain Eric Staal nudged a puck past goaltender Pekka Rinne. After stymieing the Hurricanes' attempt at a late-game rally, the Predators left their home ice for the first time this season with a valuable lesson learned. \n\"A win's a win, and we can always go back and look at things that I'm sure are going to be on tape that we can fix and clean up,\" Smith said. \"We move forward. It's all good if it's a win.\" \nReach Adam Vingan at avingan@tennessean.com and on Twitter @AdamVingan.
