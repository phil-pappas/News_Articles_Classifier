(AP) â€” \nBryan Shirreffs threw for 256 yards and a touchdown and ran for another score and UConn snapped a three-game losing streak with a 40-13 victory over Central Florida in an American Athletic Conference game Saturday afternoon. Shirreffs generated two scores in the final 57 seconds of the first half that helped the Huskies (3-3, 1-1) take a 23-3 halftime lead. Shirriffs plowed in on a 1-yard keeper two plays after Jhavon Williams' 19-yard interception return put the ball on the UCF 9, then, after an Obi Melifonwu interception, Shirreffs connected with Noel Thomas for a 16-yard touchdown with 49 seconds left in the half. Arkeel Newsome rushed for 84 yards and two touchdowns for the Huskies. The Knights (0-6,0-2) took a 3-0 lead on Matthew Wright's 19-yard field goal on the game's first possession, but managed just 56 total yards of offense the rest of the first half. Justin Holman (27 of 50 for 255 yards) threw an 11-yard touchdown to Nick Patti with 1:38 remaining.
