Which brings us to the question, what was your favorite moment in the Democrats' first presidential debate of 2015?\nSome folks say it was the moment Vermont's self-described \"democratic socialist\" Sen. Bernie Sanders gave front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton the gift of saying he had heard more than enough about her \"damn emails.\"\nThe audience roared its agreement. We don't often see a candidate let an opponent's scandal like the investigations into Clinton's private email server go to waste. But Sanders probably won more new friends by defending Clinton than he would have by piling on with what has been a mostly Republican crusade.\nBut there were other big moments. Who could forget former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee's awkwardly calling himself a \"block of granite\" on the issues, even as he looked and sounded more like a smiling bowl of mush?\nAnd there was the odd gleam in former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb's eyes as the decorated combat veteran reminisced about the time he killed a man who had wounded him in Vietnam. Ah, memories.\nBut the most memorable moment in my view may well have come after a commercial break, when former Secretary of State Clinton returned from the bathroom to join her all-male lineup of rivals who were waiting onstage.\n\"Secretary Clinton,\" said a relieved CNN moderator Anderson Cooper, \"welcome back.\"\nBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton vs. capitalism Steve Chapman On Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders, along with other Democratic presidential candidates, were in Las Vegas, a city that does not believe in stifling commercialism, at the Wynn hotel, where suites go for as much as $900 per night. They came to deplore the evils of capitalism.\n... On Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders, along with other Democratic presidential candidates, were in Las Vegas, a city that does not believe in stifling commercialism, at the Wynn hotel, where suites go for as much as $900 per night. They came to deplore the evils of capitalism.\n... (Steve Chapman) \"Well, thank you,\" she replied, casting a smile to the audience. \"You know, it does take me a little longer. That's all I can say.\"\nThe audience exploded in laughter and, unlike not-ready-for-prime-time Chafee, people were laughing with her, not at her. With exquisite comic timing, she called attention to what made her most obviously different from her fellow Democratic candidates without being sanctimonious about it.\nThat's important for Clinton, who ever since her first presidential run has had to push back the tag, rightly or wrongly, of not being \"likable\" enough.\nRemember how it oddly worked to her advantage in 2008? During a debate days before the New Hampshire primary, then-Sen. Barack Obama muttered, \"Oh, you're likable enough, Hillary,\" in a dismissive way that some women compared to bad memories of their first husbands.\nIs the obsession with \"likability\" a form of sexism? I won't try to deny it, just as I won't deny that Obama as an African-American needs to avoid appearing too angry more than his white counterparts might.\nJoe Biden's moment may have passed Dana Milbank CNN announced before this week's Democratic debate that it had an extra lectern in Las Vegas, just in case Vice President joe Biden joined the race at the last minute. Before long the lectern had its own Twitter handle, @ bidenspodium .\n“I'm so cold,” it tweeted before the debate, “and lonely.” It...\nCNN announced before this week's Democratic debate that it had an extra lectern in Las Vegas, just in case Vice President joe Biden joined the race at the last minute.

In her potty-break moment, Clinton sounded funny, spontaneous and, most important, human instead of the robo-candidate she too often displays when she isn't hiding out from reporters' questions.\nBut her debate performance was not perfect. She might have received a pass on the emails, but she produced a word salad worthy of Sarah Palin when questioned about the future of Syria, among other trouble spots.\nShe also should hope everybody forgets her view of Wall Street's 2008 meltdown. \"I represented Wall Street\" as New York's senator, she said, and \"I went to Wall Street in December of 2007, before the big crash ... and I basically said 'Cut it out.'\" Sanders' supporters groaned. The Democratic base wants to hear more than \"Cut it out\" as a message to Wall Street, especially when Sanders' crusade against \"casino capitalism\" is drawing surprisingly big crowds — even in red states.\nBut Sanders also stumbled in explaining his votes against gun safety legislation. Sanders' defense that he comes from a mostly rural state where gun control is unpopular seemed to collapse as Clinton noted how upstate New York is rural too. She did not mention how much downstate New York is not rural, but she got away with the omission.\nOverall, Democrats could be proud that their first debate avoided the rancor that the Republican stage has offered, especially in Donald Trump's big moments. We probably won't see Chafee, Webb or former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley on stage for long unless they find some momentum somewhere.\nBut Clinton also should be cautious about overconfidence. If she wins the nomination and faces the Republican nominee, one thing is certain: The love fest will be over.\nClarence Page, a member of the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at www.chicagotribune.com/pagespage .\ncpage@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ cptime\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Hillary Clinton Elections Bernie Sanders Democratic Party Jim Webb Lincoln Chafee Clarence Page", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bidenspodium", "http://www.twitter.com/cptime", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621576b/turbine/ct-sanders-clinton-captialism-perspec-1015-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56213f3d/turbine/ct-hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-clarence-page-perspec-1018-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fe2ac/turbine/ct-joe-biden-president-missed-moment-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:14:39.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
