I think (that span) kinda got us over the hump and let us go, ‘OK we can relax right now and play some football.’ ”\nCougars quarterback Justin Howard found Zeb Petty open on a corner route for a 26-yard gain on fourth-and-two midway through the second quarter to set up a first-and-goal. Howard scored on a one-yard sneak the next play to slice into Chuckey-Doak’s lead at 14-13.\nChuckey-Doak fumbled on the ensuing kickoff and Daniel Murphy pounced on the loose ball, giving the Cougars the ball at Chuckey-Doak’s 7. Cade Barnes quickly found the end zone on a seven-yard touchdown run with 6:25 remaining in the second half to give Northview Academy a 19-14 lead.\nNorthview Academy (5-2, 3-1 Region 1-3A) never lost the momentum from that sudden change of events.\nThe Cougars’ game plan after that 10-second span was simple: use a suffocating defense and a run-heavy offense to pound Chuckey-Doak (4-3, 1-3) into submission. Northview racked up 425 rushing yards on 54 carries, while mixing in big plays in the passing game. Howard completed five of 12 passes for 112 yards. His touchdown pass to Petty stretched the Cougars lead to 39-14.\nChuckey-Doak scored a couple of late rushing touchdowns to make the final score more respectable.\n“I said that this is a man’s game,” Loveday said. “This is the toughest challenge mentally that we have had, staying focused — everyone knowing that it is a big game. Getting some newspaper publicity in East Tennessee, that got their attention a little bit. We rose to the challenge. We just play hard.”\nJonathan Toye is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:35:48.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
