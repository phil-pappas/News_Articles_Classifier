When the final buzzer sounded, a franchise-record 18,933 fans waved white towels. \nAnd celebrate they did. \nSeimone Augustus shed tears of joy after a throwback performance. Owner Glen Taylor hugged coach Cheryl Reeve, and Moore leaped on to the scorer’s table and pumped her fists toward the crowd. \n\"The way we grinded together — a lot of things happen throughout the season that people don’t even know,\" said Augustus, who added 16 points. \"We kept grinding and working despite everything that we’ve been through.\" \nRebekkah Brunson grabbed 14 rebounds for the Lynx, who also won it all in 2011 and 2013. Maya Moore scored just five points on 1-for-8 shooting, but the Lynx defense forced 21 turnovers and held Indiana to 35.7 percent shooting in the league’s first Game 5 since 2009. \nTamika Catchings had 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Fever, who were seeking for their second championship. \nIt was a stunning collapse for the previously unflappable Fever, who had staved off elimination five straight times in these playoffs leading into Game 5. \nStar guard Briann January and Catchings helped turn Indiana into a tough, confident bunch that erased an 18-point deficit to beat the Liberty in Game 2 of the East finals, but finally ran into a wall they couldn’t break through at the boisterous Target Center on Wednesday night. \nIn the second and third quarters, the Fever scored 12 points total and turned the ball over 17 times. \nJanuary scored six points in the first quarter for Indiana, but didn’t get her next bucket until six minutes were gone in the third. She finished with 13 points on 6-for-15 shooting. \nThe game got off to an ugly start, with the Lynx taking a 27-21 lead at halftime in the lowest-scoring first half in finals history. Neither team seemingly could hit a shot or hold on to the ball, and Moore was held to just three points on 1-for-5 shooting.
