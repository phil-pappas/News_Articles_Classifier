The MC is not paying any attention to the development of markets in other parts of the city. Nazar Dhaliwal,\nChandigarh\nMake alternative arrangements\nTo avoid chaos in markets in the festival season, the Administration should make alternative changes to create more parking space. Closed parking lots will add to congestion as residents will be forced to park their vehicles on the roadside, resulting in mishaps. Signboards indicating the direction of parking lots should be installed to avoid any confusion. The aim should be to provide a parking facility to commuters instead of troubling them. Shruti Marwaha,\nChandigarh\nGood decision\nIt will be a decision in favour of the public and shopkeepers as a large number of people visit the city markets with their vehicles during the festival season. In these sectors, there is lack of enough parking space. But before taking such a decision, the Administration should provide adequate parking space at other places. Narinder Pal Singh Komal, Chandigarh\nCan add to chaos\nProhibiting the parking of vehicles in city markets in the festive season will add to the chaos. It is not a right decision on the part of the MC. There is a need for more parking space in the festive season.The better option will be the use of an open space for shops. Opinder Kaur Sekhon,\nChandigarh\nChalk out plan for whole city A welcome step for the residents who live near the markets. On the other hand, congestion will increase on adjoining roads. For the past many years, congestion has increased manifold during the festive season. Hence, a separate plan should be chalked out for the whole city. Vishal,\nMohali\nIt’s a foolish Idea\nThe decision of the Municipal Corporation (MC) to close parking lots of Sectors 15, 19 and 22 during the festival season is a foolish idea. Instead, all school grounds and parking spaces in hospitals/dispensaries should be used to accommodate the rush of vehicles. Security personnel and Home Guards jawans should be deployed in the markets for the smooth flow of traffic during the festival season. RK Kapoor,\nChandigarh\nProvide battery-operated vehicles to the elderly Prohibiting the parking of vehicles in markets during festive season in three sectors of the city will certainly help in reducing the rush of vehicles. The MC should provide battery-operated vehicles especially for old-age persons and children so that they could be taken to nearby alternative parking spaces. The MC should allow temporary stalls at parking lots. Rajiv Sood,\nChandigarh\nWill aggravate situation\nIt will further aggravate the situation on roads. Traffic jams will become a routine affair. Crossing the roads will become risky. The rush of vehicles will shift from parking lots to sector roads in front of the houses. Shopkeepers will also oppose the decision. Earlier, the decision of the MC to allow the parking of vehicles in schools and open grounds instead of parking lots also failed to ease the congestion. Rashmi Sood,\nChandigarh\nClear parking spaces of stalls The decision of allowing the parking of vehicles in schools and open spaces during the festive season may not go down well with the shopkeepers and customers. The problem of congestion occurs due to stalls at parking spaces in front of the shops. The MC must keep a watch on vendors and clear the area in front of shops and parking spaces of the stalls. Wg Cdr Jasbir Singh Minhas (retd), Mohali\nWill cause inconvenience to residents The decision of the MC can’t be helpful in managing the festival rush. It will rather add to the chaos as people would start parking their vehicles on roads, leading to traffic jams and causing inconvenience to commuters. Sahib Singh,\nChandigarh\nProvide open spaces to traders The decision of the MC doesn’t seem to be in the right direction as it will add to the chaos on roads. Open spaces meant for holding social functions can be allocated to shopkeepers. Jaskaran Preet Kaur,\nChandigarh\nIt may lead to haphazard parking The MC has chosen to convert parking spaces into makeshift markets during the festival season but what about the safety of vehicles. The decision of the MC will invite haphazard parking of vehicles on roads. This will serve no purpose. Instead of closing the parking lots, more space should be provided to tackle the festive rush. Daljit Kaur,\nChandigarh\nSolution lies in proper implementation The move is in the right direction if implemented well because it can also lead to chaos on roads. Observing a car-free week during the festive season will be of great help. The Municipal Corporation can create awareness regarding this through FM and hoardings. All parking lots can be converted into paid parking lots on an hourly basis. Upasana S Bhargava,\nChandigarh\nMove against senior citizens\nThe MC’s decision of vehicle-free parking area in some sectors due to the festive season is against the interest of senior citizens. The area created in front of the markets is meant for parking. Allow vehicles till the slots are full and adjust the spillover in the area specified. Ensure encroachment-free corridors and stall-free parking area. Wg Cdr J S Bhalla (retd), Chandigarh\nMove will not serve any purpose The decision of the MC to close the parking lots in Sectors 15,19 and 22 during the festival season in order to ease the traffic is wrong and will not serve any purpose. The parking spaces will be occupied by unauthorised vendors, resulting in more traffic congestion. The visitors, who are not aware of the decision, will be left baffled and forced to park their vehicles on the road. Capt Jagdish Chand,\nChandigarh\nEfficient management required\nThe only solution is efficient parking management in coordination with the police and the public. The use of schools, community centres for the parking of vehicles will help ease pressure on parking lots.
