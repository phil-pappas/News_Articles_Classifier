The Spartans beat the Vikings 3-0, giving them a home game next week to open regional play. \n“We looked really good,” EHS head coach Victor Ibarra said. “And that’s what you want to see going into the postseason, like we did last year.” \nStarting the game with less than 10 minutes remaining in the first half, where lightning ceased play three weeks ago, it took no time for the Spartans to get on the board as Bryan Zapata gave his team a 1-0 lead. \n“(Bryan) is a main catalyst to make sure our team functions really well,” Ibarra said. \nIn the second half, Emporia High got a pair of goals in a six-minute span as a Mason Mohn header boosted the lead to 2-0 and a Mario Magana kick gave EHS a 3-0 advantage. \nFrom there, it came down to keeping the Vikings at bay, which was easier spoken than accomplished against a 10-5 Seaman team. \nStill, the win assured Emporia High it would get a home game next Tuesday as regional play begins. The Spartans will challenge Maize South with a 6 p.m. kickoff. \nThe win ended up being a necessity to host, after a 4-4 draw at Shawnee Mission South Thursday. \n“I don’t think they realized, truly, how important yesterday’s game was,” Ibarra said. “We definitely want to host because we’re a pretty good home team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:10:22.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
