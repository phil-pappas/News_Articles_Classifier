Nelson, a standout wide receiver and special teams player since his arrival in Eugene last fall, practiced all spring at defensive back but hadn’t seen any action on that side of the ball this season before Saturday’s 45-38 double-overtime loss to Washington State at Autzen Stadium. The 5-foot-8, 170-pounder from Daytona Beach, Fla., started in place of Reggie Daniels and finished with a game-high 12 tackles and two pass breakups. “It was different at first,” Nelson said. “It took a little bit to get used to, but it was good to get out there and make plays. The defense played well. There are a lot of things that we can work on, but that is what practice is for.” Nelson still started on offense and, according to Oregon, is believed to be the first player to start on both sides of the ball for the Ducks since College Football Hall of Famer Mel Renfro, who played from 1961-63. “I think my position will be up in the air each week,” Nelson said. “I don’t know what the coaches have planned, but it doesn’t matter to me. I think I played well. I just need to do what I’ve been practicing and make things happen. Going out there at first, I didn’t know how I was going to play, but as the game went on I got more comfortable.” MORE MILESTONES FOR FREEMAN : Despite the loss, running back Royce Freeman had another stellar game for the Ducks, rushing for more than 200 yards for the first time in his career. The sophomore finished with 246 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries. He also had three receptions for 46 yards and a touchdown. “The offensive line did a great job opening things up,” Freeman said. “We need to work on running the ball. I was just trying to make plays and not trying to go down. We are trying to get better every week, putting my best foot forward and trying to make that happen.” With 10 career 100-yard games, Freeman is tied with Terrence Whitehead (2002-05), Onterrio Smith (2001-02), Ruben Droughns (1998-99) and Bobby Moore (1969-71) for seventh on the UO career list. Freeman also scored a touchdown for the sixth straight game and tied Jonathan Stewart (2005-07) for sixth with 27 career rushing touchdowns. His 30 total scores are good for ninth all-time. COUGARS SNAP LOSING STREAK : Washington State recorded its first win against the Ducks since a 34-23 victory in Pullman in 2006. It was their first win at Autzen Stadium since a 55-16 victory in 2003. Oregon’s average margin of victory during its winning streak was 29 points. “They’ve had a great thing going for however long it’s been,” WSU receiver Gabe Marks said. “They were one of the best teams in the country and when you play against one of the best team in the country, that’s what happens. But we never discussed (the losing streak) or anything like that.” LB PREVOT STANDS OUT : Linebacker Torrodney Prevot had a breakout game with a career-high nine tackles, including two for a loss of yards. The 6-3, 225-pound junior also had two pass breakups, including one that ended a drive by Washington State in the second half, and forced a fumble by Keith Harrington that was recovered by safety Khalil Oliver. NOTABLE : The Ducks had a season-high seven sacks, with six different players getting in on the action. Defensive end DeForest Buckner led with two sacks. … Oregon has lost back-to-back home games for the first time since 2002, when they dropped games to Arizona State and USC. … The Ducks are 3-3 through six games for the first time since 2004. That team finished 5-6. … Oregon had been 27-0 when leading after the third quarter since the start of 2013. … Oregon rushed for over 400 yards for the second time this season, finishing with 410 on 50 carries. … Oregon extended its string of consecutive sellouts at Autzen Stadium to 107 games with an announced attendance of 57,775.
