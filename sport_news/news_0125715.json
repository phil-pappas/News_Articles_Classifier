(AP Photo/David Goldman, File) Report an error INDEPENDENCE, OHIO - \nTristan Thompson and the Cleveland Cavaliers ended an impasse with a five-year contract signed Thursday. The deal is worth $82 million and is fully guaranteed. \nNo player or team options are included in the contract, which appears to be a massive victory for Thompson. \nThompson's agent, Rich Paul, first leaked Wednesday that the deal worth $16.4 million per season was in the offing. \n\"It's been a long summer of grinding and hard work but now it's back to The Land to take care of some unfinished business. #HappyToBeBack #ALLin,\" Thompson tweeted. \nThompson and the Cavaliers had not been able to end a standoff that started on the first day of free agency in July when it was reported that the sides were close to an agreement. \nThe 24-year-old sought a max contract of five years at $94 million or three years at $53 million, but the Cavs previously would not offer more than $80 million. \nCavs superstar LeBron James urged the team to re-sign Thompson throughout the summer and into the preseason, saying the situation was a distraction to the team. Thompson rejected a one-year, $6.9 million qualifying offer from the Cavs and appeared ready to hold out into the regular season. \nThompson averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds off the bench for the Cavs last season but started 15 games during the playoffs after Kevin Love was sidelined with a shoulder injury and averaged 9.6 points and 10.8 rebounds during Cleveland's run to the NBA Finals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:21:22.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
