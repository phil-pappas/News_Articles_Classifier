Eliot met with the media Wednesday to breakdown the Auburn performance and look ahead to Mississippi State. You can read a full transcript of his comments below:\nOpening statement: “We got a lot of reps in. Got some extra reps in today. That’s good, we need them. Got some things ironed out. Got some different players in different spots. With Melvin (Lewis) out, and Matt and some of those other guys are getting more reps at nose (guard). They needed more reps and we’re getting them. Practice for that part went well. I think the guys are into it, locked in and ready to go. We’re excited about this challenge. We’re looking forward to playing the game.\n“Excellent quarterback. Dak Prescott, he’s proven himself in the SEC and he’s gotten better every year. I even see an improvement in him this year. He’s calm in the pocket, he makes good throws, he makes good decisions. He’s a big back. He’s hard to bring down. He’s their leading rusher. Quite a challenge for us but we’re looking forward to it.”\nOn who else is getting reps at nose: “Tymere Dubose and Adrian Middleton.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK WR Thaddeus Snodgrass to transfer\nOn how Matt Elam is responding to the challenge: “Matt’s worked very hard. He’s taken a very serious attitude which is good. He’s come to work every day. He’s paying attention and doing what we ask. I’m excited to see him play and continue to watch him practice for the rest of the week.”\nOn where he considers his defense halfway through the season: “I think in the SEC games we’ve done some good things. We haven’t played as well in our non-conference games, but we’ve done some good things in our SEC games. Last week, the biggest concern or challenge for us was third down defense and explosive passes. Good thing is we were able to get lined up to their tempo. We reviewed the film and there weren’t any plays that we didn’t get lined up. We were prepared for that, but we didn’t execute as well on third down defense in the last game as we had in previous SEC games. Overall, the four SEC games that we’ve played, I think we’ve played well.”\nOn where the defense is health wise to this point: “I think it’s about where you would expect it to be halfway through the season. We don’t have a lot of guys out. Obviously losing Melvin is going to hurt us, not only with his play but with his leadership too. But I think we’re in good shape.”\nOn if Jordan Jones is practicing: “Yeah. He's practicing some. He is practicing some.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK players brace for Starkville cowbells\nOn if he's moving guys around at other spots on the defensive line: “Adrian usually plays a D-Tackle, and he's playing more nose. Adrian's playing some more in there at a different position.”\nOn if it's hard to transition between positions: “A nose guard is like corner, and – I think I've used this Quote: before – it's easy in theory but it's hard in application, so assignment-wise he doesn't have to learn a lot, but he better get in there and hold a point. It's going to be more skill than it is assignment.”\nOn if he will use less 3-4 without Lewis or if schematically things won't change: “I think that for us our scheme won't change much. I think that we're just going to fill the void with different players, but we won't change our scheme much. I think we'll just stay on track.”\nOn if there was an underlying theme to UK's third down struggles vs. Auburn: “The things that I think we could have done better in Auburn – we stopped the run. Our goal was to hold them under 3.9 a rush, statistically, and we did that. I think it was 3.2, and that was the goal going into the game, is we had to stop the run game because they were a running team. But we gave up explosive passes. I think we gave up four explosive passes, so we gave up four long bombs. And then we got into a lot of third and long situations, which I would have thought that if we got into a lot of third and long situations in that game with them being a running team, we would be in good shape. After reviewing the film, I think it was a combination of pass rush on third down and then tackling. We had them in position a couple of times and we didn't get them on the ground. And then you just got to win some one-on-one in coverage, too. So those three things on third down. Now, we didn't play good enough on third down but I didn't coach good enough on third down. Anytime something isn't done well then it's a group effort. There's things that I could have coached better, too.”\nOn losing Melvin Lewis and what he has said to him: “It's tough. He's disappointed and he's down, but he's such a good person. I think that he'll bounce back emotionally and he'll bounce back physically.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nQ&A: Stoops impressed by Prescott's progress\nOn if he's noticed a difference in his teammates after losing Lewis: “I have noticed that guys kind of want to play for him. He and Matt are very close friend, and Matt is really taken his role serious. I think that he wants to play well and not only for himself, but for Melvin.”\nOn if facing a QB without an interception is extra motivation and why they haven't had an interception as a defense in a while: “We've dropped a lot. We've had our opportunities and we haven't been able to pull them in. We've got to make those plays. And yes, I think there is motivation to play against Dak Prescott. He's such a great quarterback that when we have success I think that'll be a good accomplishment.”\nOn if he knows how many potential interceptions they've dropped: “I don't have the number on me, but there's been – we've been in position to make them a lot. I think back to the Missouri game. Well, one we got called back for a touchdown, there, but then we had two or three others that really could have won the game. There was one in the endzone, there was one here, I think, on the sideline. And then we had a couple – there was one in this last game, too, that we could have got in the endzone, too. Oh well. We've got to make 'em.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK tidbits | Lewis out for the season\nOn Prescott not running as much and what he's seen from him on the ground: “Well, he's still their leading rusher. He's the leading rusher for Mississippi State. You're right. They don't have as many rush attempts overall. He still is carrying the majority of their plays, you know what I mean? But you're right. They don't have as many rush attempts overall. One reason is, I think he's passing it very well. He is really become an effective passer. He's calm in the pocket, he makes right decisions and he makes good throws.”\nOn what Matt Elam has to do to be effective: “Matt has to play with technique. He's got to play hard and fast every down. He's going to have to dig in there and play more reps than he's used to playing so he's gonna have to really fight through fatigue and really give us that extra effort that we're gonna need.”\nSign up to get more like this free in your inbox", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46837b90ae998993d99356e31057d6d0ad0c3903/c=334-0-1667-1333/local/-/media/2015/09/19/Louisville/Louisville/635782949702762010-UKvsFlorida05.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c5c96b2a82526d504993f6c9c731712f1f8742a/c=369-0-2369-2000/local/-/media/Louisville/None/2014/10/25/635498635189170108-UKvsMissStMW19.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2b8780f53b401e486cfdf521f1c277c3d4abf68/c=566-0-2833-2267/local/-/media/2015/10/21/Louisville/Louisville/635810391587713931-AP-352280403861.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14d4398027418794c4e2e9139447b2c3353d1844/c=715-0-3979-3264/local/-/media/2015/10/21/Louisville/Louisville/635810302438602466-USATSI-8124395.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:50:04.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
