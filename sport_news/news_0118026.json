They were replaced by Louis Longridge and Greg Docherty.It was the home side who carved out the first real chance of the game when Edwards picked out David Amoo at the back post and he blasted well over.At the other end, a Carlton Morris effort was blocked and the ball fell for Docherty, but he could not keep his volley down and on target.Antons Kurakins then tried his luck with a shot from the edge of the area that flashed past the post.Accies still looked most likely to open the scoring and Tomas Cerny was called into action to parry a decent shot from Gramoz Kurtaj.The ball broke for Longridge but he was off target with a strike that fell narrowly wide.Thistle then passed up a good chance of their own when Callum Booth teed up Steven Lawless and he nodded just over at the back post.The home side were dealt a blow when Cerny was forced out of the action after 33 minutes and his place between the sticks was taken by Ryan Scully.Even so, it was Thistle who rallied late in the first half.Lawless played Amoo through on goal but he was unable to get a shot off and the chance was lost.Tagliapietra was then shown a straight red deep into stoppage time by referee Euan Anderson for a push on Pogba.The forward recovered enough from the incident to fire Thistle into the lead on the hour mark. Amoo was the provider with a cross from the left and Pogba lashed home from a few yards.Hamilton player-boss Martin Canning immediately threw himself into the action as his side tried to force their way back into the game.And they did just that when Imrie raced onto a through ball from Kurtaj and rounded Scully before despatching into the empty net on 78 minutes.
