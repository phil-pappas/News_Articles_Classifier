At first glance, it appeared to be an embarrassing sequence for the netminder. \nBut Babcock didn’t waste much time in requesting a challenge, and he was proven right. Canadiens forward Tomas Plekanec, to the left of Bernier and jostling with Toronto defenceman Matt Hunwick, interfered with the goalie before the puck crossed the line, his stick making contact with Bernier’s head/neck area. \nA coach has the option of asking for a challenge on an off-side play that results in a goal or on a play in which a goal is scored while there is interference on the goaltender. \nSince Babcock was successful and the call was overturned, keeping the score 1-1 in an eventual 3-1 Toronto loss, the Leafs retained their timeout. \nCommunication between assistant coaches Andrew Brewer and Jim Hiller spurred the challenge. \n“I didn’t challenge nothing,” Babcock said. “Brewer yelled in Jim Hiller’s ear and Jim Hiller said we are challenging. They were good enough to put it up on the screen so I knew by the time they got over there to challenge. \n“It’s not like I went in and said I am going to challenge something. It just happened.” \nSaid Leafs forward Daniel Winnik: “I have the opportunity to be on the competition committee and I think (the option of a challenge) is great. Refs are human. I think a play like that where it happens so fast and they don’t know and clearly the replay is goalie interference ... (the challenge) is something I welcome in the game and you saw tonight why we have it.” \nFROM THE HASH MARKS \nThe Leafs’ effort in a nutshell: Good tempo, fine effort, hard work, much improvement over 2014-15, but trouble scoring goals. It’s going to become a theme ... The Leafs, following pre-game introductions, gathered around the centre-ice faceoff circle and saluted the crowd of 19,241 with their sticks. Let’s hope this is the last link to the Salutegate fiasco of last season, one of many goofy embarrassments for a Leafs club that couldn’t stop tripping over itself ... Call Leo Komarov’s hit on P.K. Subban in the first period for what it was: Dirty and dangerous. Komarov was lucky to get just a boarding minor on the play after he slammed Subban into the corner boards deep in the Montreal end, and he was lucky Subban was not seriously hurt. It took Subban a few shifts to work the kinks out ... Komarov took another healthy run at Subban in the second period but didn’t connect. Subban, not surprisingly, managed to have an impact by the end of the night as he assisted on all three Montreal goals ... The hit Morgan Rielly used to level Alexander Semin along the boards in the Canadiens end not long after the game started? Perfect. It’s not something Rielly has done much in his brief time in the NHL, but making it habitual wouldn’t be a bad thing ... Jake Gardiner made an excellent skate save in the third, using his left blade to thwart David Desharnais. Otherwise, it was a one-goal lead for the Canadiens ... That Jonathan Bernier allowed such a weak goal, on the first shot he faced, was tough. Encouraging was that Bernier quickly forgot about Max Pacioretty’s shot hitting him and sliding into the net. Rielly nearly got to the puck in time but was an inch or two behind it as it crossed the goal line ... Nick Spaling was alone in front of Canadiens goalie Carey Price in with under nine minutes to play and shot wide. When the Canadiens gained control and went back down the ice, they scored, with Alex Galchenyuk eating up a big Bernier rebound for the winner ... Holland probably couldn’t fall asleep once he got home. \nPOINT SHOTS \nThere was a loud, sustained cheer for Blue Jays’ Marcus Stroman and Russell Martin and Aaron Sanchez when they were shown in a private box during the first period, followed by a “Let’s Go Blue Jays” chant. Good on the Leafs, too, for putting together a tribute video commemorating the Jays’ memorable regular season ... Speaking of the Jays, the Ottawa Senators gladly have found a place on the playoff bandwagon. The Sens open their season on Thursday night in Buffalo, followed by a visit to the ACC on Saturday night. Coach Dave Cameron moved up the time of practice on Friday in Toronto so his players can go to Game 2 of the American League Division Series at the Rogers Centre that day. “We’ve changed practice so guys can go the game,” Cameron told reporters on Wednesday. “See, I’m not that mean, crusty guy you guys all think I am.” We’ve known Cameron since his days as coach of the St. Michael’s Majors of the Ontario Hockey League. Mean? Crusty? Never. But always entertaining ... Playing during the announcement of the Leafs’ starters was Won’t Get Fooled Again by The Who. How can we be sure? ... Think it was just the players itching to get back to action? No less than 24 scouts from across the NHL had reserved seats in the press box.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:10:12.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
