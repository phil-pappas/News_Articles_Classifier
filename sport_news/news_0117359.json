Neither of the bitter rivals was able to produce more than one shot on target.\nHere is a look at the top European leagues:\n___\nSPAIN\nLuis Suarez scored a hat trick as Barcelona came from behind to defeat Eibar 3-1, joining Real Madrid atop the Spanish league standings.\nEibar surprised early at the Camp Nou with a goal by striker Borja Baston in the 10th minute, but Suarez helped the defending champions rally with goals in the 21st, 48th and 85th minutes.\nBarcelona played the final minutes with 10 men after defender Javier Mascherano was sent off with a straight red card.\nBarcelona and Real Madrid have 21 points each after nine rounds, but Madrid remained ahead on goal difference after defeating fourth-place Celta Vigo 3-1 on Saturday in Vigo. Celta fell three points behind the leaders.\nAtletico Madrid moved to third by beating Valencia 2-1.\n___\nENGLAND\nManchester United and Manchester City played out a 0-0 draw in the Premier League, while Tottenham surged to a 5-1 victory at Bournemouth.\nAlso, Jurgen Klopp was denied a first victory as Liverpool manager when Sadio Mane scored a late goal to earn Southampton a 1-1 draw at Anfield.\nUnited went closest to winning against City when substitute Jesse Lingard turned a high ball from Anthony Martial onto the crossbar.\nThe point moves City back to the top of the Premier League standings. Manuel Pellegrini's side is level on 22 points with Arsenal but has a superior goal difference. United stays fourth on 20 points.\nLiverpool is ninth on 14 points, with Southampton a place higher on the same total with a higher goal difference.\nAlso, Sunderland got its first win of the season with a 3-0 victory against northeastern England rival Newcastle, which dropped Aston Villa to last on the day it fired manager Tim Sherwood.\n___\nFRANCE\nParis Saint-Germain strikers enjoyed a prolific evening and left-back Laywin Kurzawa made the most of one of his rare starts to score his first goal with the French champions in a 4-1 win over Saint-Etienne.\nZlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and Lucas Moura scored PSG's other goals, giving Laurent Blanc's unbeaten side a seven-point lead over promoted Angers at the top of the standings after just 11 weeks.\nKurzawa, who joined from Monaco this summer, was given only his third start for PSG and slotted home a cool finish in the 23rd minute after getting past defender Francois Clerc on the left side of the area.\nAfter a disappointing goalless draw against injury-hit Real Madrid in the Champions League midweek, PSG's forwards were more convincing. Cavani gave PSG more room to breathe in the 48th minute at the end of a counterattack after connecting with a cross from Ibrahimovic, who found the net in the 67th minute from Cavani's assist at the conclusion of a move ignited by Di Maria.\nSaint-Etienne reduced its deficit in the 73rd minute when Marquinhos failed to clear the ball and shot straight at Verrati, who beat his own keeper. The Italian made amends with three minutes left to play with a good cross that Lucas headed in.\n___\nITALY\nRoma beat Fiorentina 2-1 to move two points clear of its Tuscan opponent at the top of Serie A.\nFormer Fiorentina player Mohamed Salah and Gervinho scored in the first half before Khouma Babacar netted a consolation for Fiorentina with almost the last kick of the match.\nSalah was sent off two minutes from time after being shown a second yellow card for protesting after his initial booking.\nNapoli won 1-0 at Chievo Verona to move into second spot, above Fiorentina, Inter Milan and Lazio on goal difference. Lazio beat Torino 3-0.\nEarlier, Juventus beat Atalanta 2-0, while AC Milan edged Sassuolo 2-1 as Rossoneri goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma became the youngest shotstopper to start a Serie A match at age 16 years, 8 months, 6 days.\nUdinese won 1-0 against Frosinone and Sampdoria beat Hellas Verona 4-1 in the lunchtime kickoff.\n___\nGERMANY\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat trick and Shinji Kagawa starred as Borussia Dortmund routed bottom side Augsburg 5-1 in the Bundesliga.\nIlkay Gundogan combined with Gonzalo Castro before crossing for Aubameyang's tap-in in the 18th minute and Marco Reus made it 2-0 three minutes later, when Kagawa turned a defender one way then the other before crossing for the Germany forward.\nKagawa back-heeled the ball for Reus to claim his second in the 33rd and Aubameyang slid in to convert substitute Adrian Ramos' shot at the far post in the 85th, after Augsburg's Raul Bobadilla had reduced the deficit with a header from a free kick in the 49th.\nKagawa provided his third assist in injury time, when Aubameyang became the first Dortmund player to score 13 goals in just 10 league games.\nDortmund stayed seven points behind leader Bayern Munich, which has a perfect record from 10 games.\nBrazilian midfielder Raffael scored one and set up another as Borussia Moenchengladbach defeated visiting Schalke 3-1 in the late game.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
