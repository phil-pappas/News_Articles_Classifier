The Tigers’ wave of success continued, but with only one major difference. For the first time in four years, Oliver Ames is not heading to the state final after finishing fourth out of 12 teams on Monday at the Division 2 South Shore Sectional at Easton Country Club. But coming up just short doesn’t wipe out a dominant Tigers’ run, which included a 16-0 regular season and another Hockomock League championship. “Overall, everyone out there gave it their all and tried their hardest, which is most important,” said senior captain Steven Tasho. “We look back over the season, undefeated year, it was a positive year. I think everyone is going to go home a little heads hung, but they shouldn’t because we had a great season.” Oliver Ames was on the outside looking in on Monday with a score of 312, while Bishop Feehan (308), Walpole (309) and Westwood (311) all finished ahead of the Tigers, with the Shamrocks and the Rebels earning berths in the state team final next Monday at Crumpin-Fox Club in Bernardston. Two individuals kept their season alive, though, with Tasho and fellow senior captain Brian Lambert placing within the top eight to move on to the state individual final match Monday at Crumpin-Fox. Tasho, who missed the individual state final cut the past two seasons by one stroke, shot a 3-over par 74 Monday, tying for third place to qualify, while Lambert just made it in, tying for eighth with a 76. “Being a senior, this is our last run at the state title,” Tasho said. “I’m looking forward to it. It’s going to be fun. I played solid all day. I just started missing some putts coming in, unfortunately, but I hung in there, which I thought was important. “You’re fighting for your whole team. I wasn’t trying to think that much about myself, just trying to do as well as possible for the team.” Sophomore Ryan McGarry also performed well, turning in a 77, while Jack Green (85), Mark Bissonette (86) and Nick Lombardi (88) rounded out the day for the Tigers. “This is a tough, tough sectional,” said Oliver Ames head coach Leo Duggan. “So, the kids should be proud of what they’ve done. They’ve been great.” Since freshman year of the team’s senior class, the Tigers have put together a stellar four-year run. Over that span, Oliver Ames went 56-6, winning four straight Hockomock League titles and capturing South Sectional crowns in 2012 and 2013, along with a second-place finish last year.

We’ve been super strong. Seen a lot of good players come through. Some going to play college golf, Division 2, Division 1. Overall, it is a strong program.” Tasho and Lambert will have one more chance to carry on what they started. Individual accomplishment isn’t thought of much by the duo, instead focusing on what has built the program since they arrived as freshmen, the team. “I’m pretty happy me and Steven will go individually,” Lambert said. “And hopefully we can bring home something for our team.” Greg Dudek", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:10:18.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
