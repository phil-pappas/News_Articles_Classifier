Unfortunately, Watts-Jenkins suffered a dislocated and fractured left hip at the end of the play. The young hero had surgery on Monday and posted a note on Instagram to say the special moment was worth the pain: \n“Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. ” very bitter sweet end to my season. This morning I had surgery on my hip putting me out for the season. But if I got the chance I would do it all over again for my brothers. God has a plan for everyone and I will not question any obstacles I encounter on my journey . #spartanswill” \nA little bit of pain for a lifetime of glory is a trade most people would make. Congrats to Watts-Jackson on the play, and hopefully he recovers quickly.
