Posted: Friday, October 23, 2015 4:00 pm HHS comes back to outlast Vikings By JOSH FLICKINGER Staff writer beloitdailynews.com | 0 comments ROCKTON, Ill. — The players lingered on the court long after the outcome was decided. Hugs were exchanged, pictures were taken, laughter and tears abound. It was senior night at Hononegah High School, and the Indians had just escaped with a three-game victory over visiting Guilford. The victory gave the Indians a 16-0 mark in the NIC-10 for the second consecutive season. The victory over the second-place Vikings was Hononegah’s toughest challenge of the season. Trailing 14-9 in the decisive third game, a couple of the team’s nine seniors had to step up. Cue veteran stalwarts like Erika Gustafson, Sam Kavacejz and Mika Nelson took the mantle, keying the rally as the Indians roared back for a 25-20 win to cap the match. Gustafson in particular was outstanding. She served the Indians to a 15-14 lead then had several kills down the stretch. Kavacejz and Nelson did their job in the middle and sophomore Ariana Contreras was her typical steady self as libero. Kavacejz said although the Indians had already wrapped up the conference crown, the victory was important for the team. “This was a really big win for us.” Kavacejz said. “Especially with it being senior night, this is the last time we’ll get to play on this court. It was important not only to us, but to the underclassmen as well. We definitely had a good mojo going at the end.” Libby knew the Vikings, who entered play with a 13-2 mark in conference play, would represent a stiff challenge. “I knew coming in this would be the toughest match of the NIC-10 season,” Libby said. “The good part is it was at the end of the season so we were both playing at our peak. I hoped the kids would come out playing well and focusing. We came out with a lot of energy and in the end the seniors carried us through.” Things didn’t start so rosy for the Indians. Up 21-17, they allowed the Vikings to storm back for a 25-23 victory. “We knew what we needed to fix after that first game,” Kavacejz said. “We didn’t really take initiative to side-out and keep the ball. We were just playing back and forth with them until we were in the 20’s, and you can’t do that.” The Indians bounced back with a solid 25-17 victory in game two, setting up the dramatic game three finish. “I think the main reason we came back was the leadership of our seniors,” Hononegah coach Kaylee Libby said. “Erika is our go-to person and she made a lot of plays down the stretch. Once we started to chip away at the lead, you saw the confidence go up. I was happy that they fought hard and showed a lot of heart.” Gustafson, who finished with a team-high 13 kills and added 15 digs, believes it was the perfect send-off to the IHSA Class 4A regional playoffs. “I think that’ll definitely give us a feel for what we’ll see in the postseason,” Gustafson said. “It was a nice win, the second straight conference win. The crowd was great tonight, and the student section has been great all year.” The Indians will take on Belvidere North, the team hosting the regional, Tuesday night. Hononegah won both games in the regular season against the Blue Thunder, but Libby is well aware of the danger they present. “We’re going to have to come out and have really good ball control,” Libby said. “We are going to have to serve well and limit our errors. When we have a lot of momentum and good ball control, it’s hard for a lot of teams to stop us. But we have to create that good situation for ourselves.” • NOTES: Courtney Larson added 10 kills for the Indians, while Taylor Smith did a terrific job with distributing, finishing with 36 assists. Erin Schloff was solid in the middle with six kills and a team-leading three blocks, while Contreras finished with 18 digs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:28:52.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
