AP Photo/Denis Poroy Oct 4, 2015 at 9:08p ET 0Shares \nBrowns fans must have memories of Dwayne Rudd flashing through their heads. \nJust when it looked like Cleveland had done enough to force overtime during Sunday's loss to the Chargers, another yellow flag interfered. Just as Rudd's penalty for prematurely removing his helmet in celebration back in 2002 cost the Browns a victory, an offsides penalty on Tramon Williams in San Diego on Sunday was tough to swallow. Follow along as we take you from the thrill of almost victory to the agony of another Browns defeat. \nThings were looking good when coach Mike Pettine won a challenge on a terrific juggling catch by Gary Barnidge inside the Chargers' 5-yard line and Barnidge caught a touchdown pass two plays later. AP Photo/Denis Poroy \nA two-point conversion stood between Cleveland and a tie game. Presto! Josh McCown found Taylor Gabriel to tie it at 27-27 with 2:13 left in regulation. The Browns were in business. Overtime was on the horizon if they could keep Philip Rivers and the Chargers off the scoreboard in the final two minutes. Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports \nUh oh. Danny Woodhead broke loose for a 19-yard run right up the middle, and the Chargers were already in field-goal range. They could just run out the clock and kick the game-winner from 39 yards away. Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports \nBut wait, San Diego does have a rookie kicker. Maybe he would wilt under pressure and send the game into overtime. \nHe missed! Wide right! The Browns rushed off the field in celebration. Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports \nWait a minute. Williams jumped the gun trying to get around the edge. Penalty. Re-kick. Not even the Browns' official Twitter account could handle it. MISSED! Flag on the play. And we'll do this again. Ugh. â€” Cleveland Browns (@Browns) October 4, 2015 \nGame over, 30-27. Browns lose. For the eighth time in nine games. Jeff Gross/Getty Images \nJohnny Manziel congratulated his old college teammate, Josh Lambo, the hero kicker for the Chargers.
