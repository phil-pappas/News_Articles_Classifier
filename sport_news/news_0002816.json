(AP) - The Department of Environmental Conservation and the Adirondack Park Agency are taking public comments on a proposal to renovate a cabin called Porcupine Lodge on Lookout Mountain within the Whiteface Mountain Ski Area.\nThe state has to put the proposal up to public scrutiny to make sure it conforms to the Adirondack State Land Master Plan. The proposal can be viewed at DEC's website ( http://on.ny.gov/1LIO0HD ).\nPorcupine Lodge was originally used as a warming hut when Marble Mountain Ski Area was in operation. It was built in 1949.\nThe Olympic Regional Development Authority wants to make minor modifications to the lodge and construct a hospitality deck to accommodate day use by the general public during ski season.\nIt's near the top lift terminal of the new Lookout Mountain Triple Chairlift.\n ", "external_links": ["http://on.ny.gov/1LIO0HD"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:48:39.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
