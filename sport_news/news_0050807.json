By Rick Peterson rick.peterson@cjonline.com \nUndefeated Topeka High will be a huge favorite when it takes the field Friday night at Shawnee Heights (7 p.m. kickoff) against the winless T-Birds. \nAnd with a huge Class 6A district and league game against Manhattan looming a week from now, Friday night could be considered a trap game for Topeka High (5-0 overall, 4-0 in the Centennial League). \nBut Trojan coach Walt Alexander is counting on the memory of last year's 28-21 overtime loss to the T-Birds (0-5, 0-4) to keep that from happening. \n“Like I told the kids, ‘Remember, they were 1-4 last year going into our game and what happened, they knocked us off in overtime,’ “ Alexander said of Shawnee Heights, the only city school to beat High since the 2011 season. “We will not be taking anything for granted whatsoever. \n“Coach (Jason) Swift always has those kids playing tremendously hard and they will never quit. They play hard from the first snap until the last snap of every game and they're going to give us their best shot. I have no doubt about that.” \nTopeka High is coming off a 52-7 win over Seaman last week and the Trojans have outscored their opposition by an average of 47 points per game. \n“Friday night was the most complete game we've played as far as all three phases and I thought the kids played tremendously hard defensively,” Alexander said. “It was fun to watch those guys. We played really well and hopefully we can continue that.” \nTrojan senior running back Mike McCoy rushed for 289 yards and four touchdowns on 17 carries against Seaman and he leads the city in rushing with 786 yards on 57 carries and in scoring with 17 touchdowns. \nHigh junior quarterback Corey Thomas leads the city with 1,073 total yards and is third in the city in passing with 643 yards and a city-high 13 touchdown passes. \nShawnee Heights, a 5A state semifinalist a year ago, is coming off a 42-14 loss to Emporia last Friday, but Swift said the T-Birds are making progess with 5A district play looming next week. \n“We're getting better each day,” Swift said. “We're getting better on the practice field and it's starting to translate onto the game field. Come Friday night it's another way to see how much we've improved. \n“I'm very impressed with our guys. Our guys come back to work every Monday and they have the spirit of, ‘Let's do it. We believe in ourselves and let's keep working and not quit.' We go hard in practice and on Friday nights we're fighting.” \nShawnee Heights senior running back Alex Sheikh is coming off a 134-yard rushing performance against Emporia and Sheikh ranks eighth in the city in rushing with 268 yards on 56 attempts. \nT-Bird junior quarterback Trey Brown has passed for 431 yards and three touchdowns despite missing time with an injury.
