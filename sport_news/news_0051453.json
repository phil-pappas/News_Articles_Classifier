We got a few calls that were put against us, but that didn't stop us from doing what we had to do.\" \nChenango Forks, the top-ranked Class C team in New York, plays Dryden (5-3) in the Section IV semifinals on Saturday, Oct. 31 at Union-Endicott.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:12:19.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
