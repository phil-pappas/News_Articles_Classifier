Despite Brown’s 200 yards, the Warriors suffered a crippling loss. Special photo by Anthony Stalcup MARIETTA — Lassiter isn’t out of it yet.Neither is Cherokee, but it now faces a mountainous climb.Lassiter scored 21 unanswered points to erase a 22-7 deficit in the third quarter and claim a crucial 28-22 Region 5 win Friday at Frank Fillmann Stadium.The win allowed the Trojans (4-4, 2-4) to keep their playoff hopes alive, one game behind fourth-place Wheeler. After playing last-place Pope next week, Lassiter will face the Wildcats on Nov. 6 to close the regular season.Meanwhile, Cherokee (4-4, 2-4) has dropped two region games in a row, with games against region leaders Roswell and Walton on the horizon. The Warriors must beat at least one of the powerhouse teams to maintain their slim hopes.“I’m really proud of the team,” Lassiter coach Jep Irwin said. “We challenged them to win the second half and it really just came down to executing. It’s kind of been that way all season. If we execute, we score. If we don’t, we look bad.”After Cherokee offensive lineman Wyatt Fisher fell on a fumbled 1-yard rush from Brittain Brown in the end zone to put the Warriors up 22-7 with 7:43 to go in the third quarter, things looked pretty grim for Lassiter.But the Trojans regrouped on their next possession to compile a 15-play, 84-yard drive that ended in Ozi Orjioke’s 5-yard touchdown run to cut the lead to 22-13 after a missed point-after.Cherokee went three-and-out on its next possession, and Lassiter took over in good field position at its own 46-yard line. Six plays later, Cooper Cross connected with Cole Taylor on a 34-yard pass to cut Cherokee’s lead to 22-20.The Warriors responded with a 16-play drive which took 5 minutes off the clock, but they failed to come away with any points and turned the ball over after a missed 35-yard field goal.Following the missed field goal, the Trojans scored on their third consecutive drive when Orjioke dashed through the middle for a 73-yard touchdown run on the second play of their possession.Orjioke successfully scored a 2-point conversion on a “Statue of Liberty” trick play when Cross faked a pass to his right and handed the ball off to Orjioke on his back for a run to the left side. Lassiter took a 28-22 lead with 6:47 remaining and held on until the end.The Warriors’ final two possessions finished with an interception and a turnover on downs.“We cannot continue to make the same mistakes we make week in and week out,” Cherokee coach Josh Shaw said, “It was sort of a tale of two halves. We can’t continue to have the same type of penalties. Hopefully, we’ll clean that stuff up and get ready for Roswell next week. It’s not going to get any easier.”Things looked grim for Lassiter early when Nolan Donley and Aaron Knowles connected for a 91-yard touchdown pass on the second play of the game to put Cherokee up 7-0 just 33 seconds in.Cross and Cole linked up for a 39-yard touchdown pass later in the first quarter to tie it at 7-all.After both teams traded possessions deep into the second quarter, Cherokee scored a safety after Obie Brannon’s punt pegged the Trojans at their own 3-yard line. The Warriors retained possession after the score and assembled a nine-play, 61-yard drive that ended on a 10-yard Brown rush to make the score 16-7.Brown had 200 yards on 35 rushes. Orjioke finished with 166 yards on 22 carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:15:46.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
