Coach Danny Blind on Friday called up 20-year-old Ajax winger Anwar El-Ghazi as a possible replacement on the right flank.\nIceland and the Czech Republic have already qualified from Group A.\nAfter a disastrous qualifying campaign, the Netherlands — a losing semifinalist at last year's World Cup — is now two points adrift of third-place Turkey fighting for a playoff spot.\nBlind also is missing defenders Stefan de Vrij and long-term absentee Rob Vlaar for the final two qualifiers. The Dutch travel to Astana to play Kazakhstan on Oct. 10 and take on the Czech Republic three days later in Amsterdam.\n___\nNetherlands squad:\nGoalkeepers: Jasper Cillessen (Ajax), Tim Krul (Newcastle), Jeroen Zoet (PSV Eindhoven).\nDefenders: Jeffrey Bruma (PSV), Terence Kongolo (Feyenoord), Virgil van Dijk (Southampton), Daryl Janmaat (Newcastle), Jairo Riedewald (Ajax), Kenny Tete (Ajax), Karim Rekik (Marseille).\nMidfielders: Vurnon Anita (Newcastle), Daley Blind (Manchester United), Davy Klaassen (Ajax), Wesley Sneijder (Galatasaray), Georginio Wijnaldum (Newcastle), Ibrahim Afellay (Stoke).\nForwards: Memphis Depay (Manchester United), Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (Schalke), Robin van Persie (Fenerbahce), Quincy Promes (Spartak Moscow), Jeremain Lens (Sunderland), Anwar El-Ghazi (Ajax) Bas Dost (Wolfsburg).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:28:33.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
