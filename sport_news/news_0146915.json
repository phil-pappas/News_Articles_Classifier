The No. 15 Skyhawks (8-2-1, 6-1-0 Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference) earned a 1-0 victory at Adams State to maintain the top spot in the conference standings. It was the fifth consecutive win for FLC. Carolyn Archer scored her first goal of the season in the 59th minute. The FLC score was assisted by Courtney Riley. “Good goal and assist, and it was a roommate goal because they live together,” FLC head coach Jimmy Hall said in a phone message to The Durango Herald. “Good connection and a great goal for those two score.” Senior goalkeeper Caitlyn Espinosa earned her fifth shutout of the season by making five saves. It was the 27th shutout of her career, adding to her program record. Adams State (4-4-3, 2-4-1 RMAC) competed well, managing 15 shots but only five on frame. The Grizzlies also had six corner kicks to two for FLC, but the Skyhawks’ defense handled it all. “Difficult game and it’s tough to play away,” Hall said. “Adams looked good, but we had good possession and defended well enough to win.” According to Fort Lewis College, it was the 13th shutout of Adams State in the last 20 meetings against Adams State. FLC will look to keep it going at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Colorado Mines (6-2-2, 4-0-2 RMAC) in a pairing of the conference’s two top teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:44:15.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
