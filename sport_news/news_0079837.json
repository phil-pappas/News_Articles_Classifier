Honda stroked home the spot kick and Okazaki scored from close range soon after to make it 2-0. Former Bayern Munich forward Takashi Usami sealed the win late in the game.\n\"We knew this would be a tough game for us,\" Japan's Bosnian coach Vahid Halilhodzic said after the game. \"We came through it and now can look forward to the next challenge.\"\nThe win puts Japan a point clear of Syria at the halfway stage of the eight-game round. Singapore is two points behind Syria in third following a 1-0 win over Afghanistan.\nIt was an encouraging night overall for southeast Asian football. Iraq needed a 95th-minute penalty from Younis Mahmoud to salvage a Vietnam 1-1 draw in Hanoi and move two points behind Group F leader Thailand.\nNorth Korea's winning streak in World Cup qualifying came to an end with a 0-0 draw against the Philippines.\nThe North Koreans lead Group H with 10 points from four games.\nIn Group A, an injury-time goal from Abu Nahyeh gave Palestine a 1-1 draw against East Timor. Turkmenistan defeated India 2-1, Maldives defeated Bhutan 4-3 and Lebanon beat Myanmar 2-0.\nThe top team from each of the eight groups and the best four second-place teams advance to the next round of qualifying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:26:06.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
