Now, they want a long playoff run. slideshow Over the last three seasons, Etowah has compiled a 92-38 record and emerged as one of the state’s volleyball powers. Leading that charge to prominence has been a group of three seniors who have emerged as record-breaking leaders – Madeline Gilmer, Natalie Lucco and Sydney Hotaling. Gilmer is the school’s leader in career digs with 1,377, Lucco holds the mark for career kills with 1,103 and Hotaling has set the standard at setter with 2,396 career assists. While all three have certainly found individual success, they all agree that one thing is missing. “We’ve worked our butts off for six seasons,” Lucco said. “I’ve put everything into this sport, and it would be great to walk out of here winning a state championship in our last match. It would be so great for the program and the team, because we all want it and have worked so hard for it.”After Thursday’s 3-0 (25-13, 25-13, 25-19) win over Brookwood in the first round, the Lady Eagles (39-10) moved one step closer to that goal, and they will face Lambert in the second round.If Etowah is to continue advancing through the tournament, a big part of that will be the chemistry the team has formed. In addition to their three years with Etowah, Gilmer, Lucco and Hotaling began playing together when they were 13 years old with the Cobb Atlanta volleyball club. While the trio has not been together for every season, they have played together enough to have what coach Kim Robertson called “difference-making chemistry.”“We definitely have a lot of good team chemistry,” Gilmer said. “We know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. We know how to act around each other. We know when to cheer and when to be tough. It’s just something that we’ve picked up on from playing together for so long.”For Robertson, watching that chemistry grow as her team grew and matured was as rewarding as winning any match.“I can remember when these kids were just little girls coming to camp,” she said. “They’ve worked hard and gotten so much better. When you go into coaching, one of the biggest rewards is to see the kids grow and accomplish everything, and watching these girls do all that they have done has been really special. It’s a special group of girls.”With Gilmer looking ahead to being a mechanical engineering major, possibly at Alabama, Lucco looking to major in business at Georgia or Georgia Tech and Hotaling planning on going to college for athletic training before becoming a physical therapist, it is possible that this playoff run could be the last competitive volleyball they ever play. For that reason, Robertson said it is even more important to finish this season on a high note.“This is a very talented group of seniors, but they’re also a very academically smart group of girls,” she said. “They all have big aspirations in terms of college and career choices. This may be it for them in terms of volleyball, so it would be big to have their last match be a state championship win.”Even without a state championship, the seniors said their time together has been worthwhile.“We’ve played in a lot of high-pressure matches that were a lot of fun,” Hotaling said. “But our memories off the court mean even more to us. Growing that chemistry with each other personally for six years means much more than seeing it come together on the court.”The performances on the court will also be lasting though. The names will remain in the record books until a new generation of players moves in, and, for the players who will remain next season, an example of winning volleyball will be firmly in place.“They’re setting the standards,” Robertson said. “They’ve worked hard to accomplish these goals, and I think their setting a good baseline for the girls that will follow. They’ve brought a lot of leadership to the table, and they showed this program what we need to do to win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:13:59.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
