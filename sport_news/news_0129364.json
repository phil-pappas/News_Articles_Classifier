A high school principal in Maine has put the kibosh on school dances, blaming \"MTV and VH1\" for teaching his students how to grind and twerk, he told the Daily News.\nGorham High School Principal Chris Record permanently banned school dances this week after officials unsuccessfully tried for years to stop the teenagers from rubbing against each other on the dance floor.\n\"It's really almost simulated sex,\" Record told the News on Thursday. \"It came to a point where I had to say no. We've got to do better.\"\nThe 42-year-old head of the school has been making national headlines over the widely unpopular decision, which was detailed in a letter issued to nearly 900 students.\n\"It is by no means the students' fault, but the dancing they have witnessed on MTV/VHS/movies involves primarily only sexually suggestive grinding,\" Record wrote in the memo.\nThe well-known dance move involves \"a girl having her back and buttocks pushed up/pulled up against the boy's groin with the boy's hands on her hips and other places,\" he further explained.\nRecord, who has been Gorham's principal for eight years, admits he's been mocked for the seemingly old-fashioned thinking.\nHe also clarified that he meant to blame \"VH1\" in the letter and not the obsolete VHS tapes.\n\"This was a tough decision. It's not popular and it's taking a toll, but I think it's the right thing,\" he said. \"I stand by it.\"\nGorham's roughly 400 juniors and seniors used to have four school dances to look forward to each year. Record has canceled all but the end-of-the-year prom, which he called a \"classier event.\"\n\"My job is the safety and security of my students, and I take that extraordinarily seriously,\" he said. \"People can have different opinions in grinding and they can do whatever they want in clubs, but it's just not appropriate in a school setting.\"\nGoogle Gorham High School in Maine will only host the \"classier\" prom but has done away with other school dances. Friday's traditional first dance of the school year was also swapped for a homecoming bonfire.\n\"Word around the school is no one is going to go, and it's going to be lame,\" senior Billy Ruby told the Portland Press Herald .\nThe principal said administrators were vilified last fall when they told students during a dance that grinding was prohibited. Two-thirds of party-goers walked out of the school, Record said.\nThe incident also caused an \"uprising\" among seniors and juniors demanding grinding be allowed.\nRecord said school officials are \"working through\" student oppositions.\n\"We're not a nightclub, we're a school, and we have core values,\" Record said. \"It's not respectful dancing. We are objectifying each other.\"\nmchan@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Miley Cyrus reveals Donald Trump is a fan of her twerking Channing Tatum gives surprise twerking performance Dictionary editors say 'twerking' goes back almost 200 years", "external_links": ["http://www.pressherald.com/2015/10/06/gorham-high-school-wont-hold-dances/", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:14:07.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
