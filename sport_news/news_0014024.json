(Ezra Shaw/Getty Images/AFP) Article \nThe most reviled six words in the NFL vocabulary? Easy. \n“Complete the catch to the ground.” \nThat phrase, while not in the league’s rulebook word for word, popularly summarizes what is by far the most contentious, controversial and mischaracterized rule in the book. \nMany fans despise it. Some coaches and players even admit to not understanding it, most recently Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll. \nBut an impassioned defender of the “complete the catch to the ground” rule said it really isn’t that hard to grasp -- and if more people knew why it’s in the rulebook to begin with, there’d be so much less griping about it. \n“People just don’t understand the rule. That’s at the heart of the controversy,” Bill Polian told the Sun this week in a phone interview. \nHe’s the retired general manager of three NFL clubs and a former long-time member of the league’s rule-making competition committee. \nArchitect of the Buffalo Bills Super Bowl dynasty and the Indianapolis Colts dynasty with Peyton Manning, Polian was voted this year into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He is now an analyst for ESPN. \n“There is no controversy if you understand the rule,” Polian said. \nHe not only defends the complete-the-catch-to-the-ground component, but does so more emphatically -- and bluntly -- than anyone on the current competition committee, or NFL VP of officiating Dean Blandino, is free to do. \nFirst, let’s inspect the rule. \nFor a pass to be deemed a catch, the rulebook long has mandated that a pass receiver or interceptor must not only secure possession of the ball with both feet down in bounds (or any other part of his body other than his hands), but if he falls to the ground while making the catch he must retain possession throughout the “entire process of contacting the ground.” \nIf the receiver loses secure possession at any point while falling to the ground, it is incomplete. Period. \nThe two most controversial non-catches as a result of this rule are Detroit receiver Calvin Johnson’s at Chicago in 2010, and Dallas receiver Dez Bryant’s in the playoff game at Green Bay last January. \nBoth looked for all the world like completions, and were ruled completions by on-field officials -- then overturned upon video review. \n“Because of those two plays, sound and fury is raised by these self-appointed rules experts, many of whom have never set foot in an NFL locker room or an NFL facility,” Polian said. \nYet confusion and contentiousness arise every season over this rule. Probably half the teams in the league can point to a play in recent seasons -- some even in recent weeks -- where they feel the rule burned them. \nWell, get over it. And get edified, Polian said. \n“The present controversy, if you will, is in my opinion fuelled by people who are ignorant of the history, ignorant of the reason for the rule, and in many cases are self-appointed rules experts,” he said. \nControversy flared up again last Sunday, when the Chicago Bears and their huge fan base went nuts after officials overturned the on-field ruling and awarded a touchdown catch to Detroit receiver Golden Tate. \nTate secured a Matthew Stafford pass while crossing the goal-line plane, got two feet down, and while turning to take a third step was stripped of the ball by a Bears defender in the end zone. \nIt all happened in an instant. Chicago recovered the loose ball and Bears defenders celebrated what they believed was a touchback. \nNope. Overturned. Touchdown. \n“That Golden Tate play doesn’t even merit conversation,” Polian said. \nIndeed, the complete-the-catch-to-the-ground component does not even apply here. Once Tate secured possession of the ball and remained upright with two feet down in the end zone, by long-time NFL rule the play is over -- touchdown -- even if, while being stripped of the ball an instant later, Tate tumbled to the ground. \nBlandino reiterated as much on Friday in the league’s weekly video review of controversial plays. So never mind that play. \nBut the NFL received so much flak after Bryant’s catch/non-catch, the competition committee in March decided to reword the rule -- even though, in practice, it hasn’t change one iota. \nBefore March, the rule read that it’s a reception only if the receiver “maintains control of the ball long enough … to enable him to perform any act common to the game (i.e., maintaining control long enough to pitch it, pass it, advance with it, or avoid or ward off an opponent, etc.).” \nThis season the language reads: \n“A player is considered to be going to the ground if he does not remain upright long enough to demonstrate that he is clearly a runner. If a player goes to the ground in the act of catching a pass (with or without contact by an opponent), he must maintain control of the ball until after his initial contact with the ground, whether in the field of play or the end zone.” \nClearer? Or more confusing? That’s been debated. \nBut why is the complete-the-catch-to-the-ground component in the rule book to begin with? \nThe impetus goes back a long time, Polian said. And it’s something competition-committee members continually raise as the paramount reason for its inclusion. \nThat is, the avoidance of cheap fumbles. And, by extension in some cases, cheap fumble-return defensive touchdowns. \n“(Former Dallas Cowboys president/GM) Tex Schramm many years ago said the philosophy we ought to follow is we do not want cheap fumbles,” Polian said. “Because cheap fumbles do two things. \n“No. 1, they turn the ball over, which is not a good thing from an offensive standpoint, and the committee’s charge was always to bend toward offence -- to give the benefit of the doubt to the offence. “Secondly, and most importantly, fumbles in general lead to melees, and melees have the potential for injury.” \nPolian said there are more plays every season than you probably realize that would rules completions-then-fumbles if the “complete the catch to the ground” threshold were removed. \n“And we don’t want cheap fumbles. That’s the whole point,” Polian said, again, with added emphasis. “That’s what everybody misses. \n“If you eliminated that, if you say the guy has two feet on the ground, and now is contacted and the ball comes out, what do we have? In every instance, now, we have an incomplete pass … It’s a frequent occurrence. By the competition committee’s philosophy, that’s an incomplete pass -- not a fumble.” \nPolian said the committee every off-season pores over tape of the concluded season’s controversial plays. The catch rule was revisited about every other year during his tenure, he said. As with all rules, “if it can be improved, it will be improved. The committee is absolutely open to it.” \nAs an example, Polian cited the “Bert Emanuel” clarification, which went into effect in 2000. \nIn the 1999 season’s NFC championship game, Tampa Bay Bucs receiver Emanuel caught a ball without aid of the ground, but the catch rule at the time said if any part of the ball touched the ground during the process of the catch -- even if the ball was securely possessed, as in Emanuel’s case -- it is incomplete. \nThe competition committee added an exception to make it a catch. \n“That’s an example of the committee recognizing that there’s a tweak the can be made, thanks to the better (video replay) technology that we have today,” Polian said. “And I’m all for it. \n“If there’s a better alternative (to the complete-the-catch-to-the-ground rule), I’m all for exploring that, too. But I have not heard an alternative that would solve the problem. I mean, I don’t have a vote anymore, but I’m open to listening to well-thought-out alternatives that speak to the underlying context, which is that we do not want cheap fumbles. \n“But the idea that, ‘Change it, because I don’t understand the rule,’ or ‘Change it because it isn’t fair’ -- that to me makes no sense at all.” \nThat said, Polian makes two concessions to the torch-and-pitchfork crowd. \nFirst, yes, of course there is judgment inherent in this rule -- as there is in many. \n“You’re going to have judgments calls, and people can disagree with judgment calls. Lord knows I disagreed with many calls in my time.” \nSecondly, yes, there are NFL rules that seem counter-intuitive at times. Sometimes that actually has to be the case, Polian said. To help game officials. \n“Remember the famous tuck-rule play in the (2001) Patriots-Raiders playoff game? For years and years … the competition committee would say, ‘Damn! That’s counter-intuitive.’ And the officiating department would counter that by saying, ‘We can only officiate it that way, because it has to be clear-cut. We can’t have any grey area. \n“And that is also another charge of the competition committee: wherever possible, reduce the grey area for officials. You get better and more consistent officiating if you have as little grey area as possible.” \nSo is it just a matter, then, that grey-area is embedded into the catch rule? And controversy even more so? \nNo, Polian insisted. \nWhich brings this discussion full circle. \n“It’s just that are so many voices now, who don’t have any historical background or context, and no understanding of the rule and why it’s there, how it’s administered and what the rule actually says. And they just go off half-cocked. \n“That’s troubling to me, because it’s counter to the facts that I know, and secondly because there’s too much of that in every facet of life.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:04:27.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
