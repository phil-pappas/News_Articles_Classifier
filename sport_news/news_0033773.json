Photo by The Associated Press . Share \nTORONTO (AP) — Jose Bautista wiped out the need for protests or umpire reviews with the Toronto Blue Jays' biggest home run since Joe Carter's historic shot. \nToronto earned its first trip to the American League Championship Series since Carter's World Series-ending drive in 1993, overcoming one of the craziest plays in playoff history when Bautista hit a three-run homer after three Texas Rangers errors for a 6-3 victory Wednesday in the deciding Game 5 of the Division Series. Video Odor scores on errant throw Your browser does not support iframes. \n\"It's the most emotionally charged game that I've ever played,\" Bautista said. \nThe Blue Jays became the third team to win a best-of-five series after losing the first two games at home. The 2001 Yankees also did it against Oakland, and the 2012 Giants did it against Cincinnati. Both of those teams went on to reach the World Series. \n\"The odds were against us but I don't think these guys ever thought we were out of it,\" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \nToronto, who led the majors in homers this season, will play the Royals, who beat Houston in Game 5 of their series, a rematch of the 1985 ALCS. Game 1 is Friday night in Kansas City. \n\"It doesn't really matter, we're just happy we're going to the next round,\" Blue Jays slugger Josh Donaldson said. \"Whoever we play is a very, very good opponent.\" \nBautista's homer capped an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when Toronto catcher Russell Martin's seemingly routine throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking to score. \n\"That was crazy,\" Blue Jays starter Marcus Stroman said. \"With all that happened, we did a good job of keeping our emotions in check.\" \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay. \nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making errors on three straight groundballs, and Toronto rallied. Benches cleared twice in the Blue Jays' half of the inning. \nRoberto Osuna got the final five outs for his first postseason save. \nOsuna turned toward the outfield after striking out Wil Venable, looked to the sky and was mobbed by his teammates as jubilant fans rocked the Rogers Centre. \nAfter Edwin Encarnacion tied it 2-all with a second-deck drive off tough-luck loser Cole Hamels in the sixth, Odor led off the seventh with a single and went to third on a sacrifice and groundout. \nWith Choo up, Martin's throw back to reliever Aaron Sanchez deflected off Choo and dribbled toward third base. \nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister questioned the call, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home. Martin was given an error. \n\"I just caught the ball and threw it back very casually and it hit his bat and then next thing you know run scores,\" Martin said. \"It's never happened in my life before. It's just one of those moments, and it created an opportunity for us to do something special.\" \nScott acknowledged making a mistake with his initial ruling. \n\"I was mixing up two rules,\" Scott said. \"If there's no intent, if he's not out of the box, that throw is live.\" \nFans littered the field with objects during the delay as umpires sorted out a play that is certain to rank up there with Derek Jeter's Jeffrey Maier homer in 1996 or Reggie Jackson's hip block of a throw in the 1978 World Series as one of the craziest in the postseason. \n\"We went in the tunnel back there (behind the dugout) to get out of the way,\" Rangers pitcher Sam Dyson said of the barrage of bottles and other items. \nAccording to rule Major League Baseball rule 6.03(a)(3), the batter is not to be charged with interfering with the catcher if the batter is still in the batter's box and doesn't make a movement to block or disrupt the throw. \nThis type of play is not subject to manager's review but Scott, the crew chief, after discussing the ruling with Blue Jays manager John Gibbons, called an umpire's review. After a delay of 2 minutes, 32 seconds, the play stood and fans continued to throw objects on the field. \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest. \nNo need for the paperwork, though. \nThe Rangers made three consecutive errors to start the bottom half, with Martin reaching on a fielding error by shortstop Elvis Andrus to start it off. \nKevin Pillar followed with a grounder to first, but Martin was safe at second on an errant throw by Mitch Moreland. \nAfter Dalton Pompey pinch ran for Martin, Ryan Goins followed with a sacrifice bunt. Adrian Beltre fielded the ball and threw to third, but Andrus dropped the ball for his second error of the inning, loading the bases for Ben Revere. \n\"This is the toughest moment of my career so far,\" Andrus said. \"I feel like I let down my team and my city.\" \nRevere grounded into a fielder's choice, with Moreland throwing Pompey out at the plate. \nAfter Sam Dyson relieved Hamels, Donaldson tied it at 3 with a flare just beyond the reach of Odor at second, but Revere was forced out. \nBautista followed with a towering drive into the second deck, glaring at Dyson as he stood at home plate to admire his go-ahead drive, enthusiastically flipping his bat away. \n\"He's been known to hit dramatic home runs and there ain't a better time,\" Gibbons said. \"This is his first opportunity on a national stage and he rose to the occasion.\" \nWith some fans continuing to litter the field, Encarnacion turned to face the crowd and appealed for calm, lifting his bat and helmet over his head. Dyson took exception and walked over to confront Encarnacion, leading to both dugouts and both bullpens emptying. \n\"I told him Jose needs to calm that down, respect the game a little more,\" Dyson said. \nDuring the scrum that was quickly dissolved, 20 Toronto police officers stood across the outfield, while others gathered along the foul lines. Police later took position on the roof of the Rangers' first base dugout before the bottom of the ninth. \nEncarnacion and Chris Colabello both singled when play resumed, but the bat-around inning ended when Troy Tulowitzki fouled out. Dyson made contact with Tulowitzki as he walked off, leading benches to clear again, with Texas catcher Chris Gimenez shoving Tulowitzki. \nTexas opened the scoring in the first when Delino DeShields scored on a fielder's choice by Prince Fielder. Choo homered off Marcus Stroman in the third to make it 2-0. \nChoo's homer was the first for the Rangers since Odor connected off David Price in the seventh inning of Game 1. \nToronto cut the deficit in half in the third on Bautista's two-out double. \nRelated video: \n_ Text of rule for 7th-inning play in Rangers-Blue Jays \nTORONTO (AP) — Text from the Major League Baseball Umpire Manual on the rule covering the play in which Toronto catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the pitcher deflected off Rangers batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed a run to score: 54. BATTER INTERFERES WITH CATCHER'S THROW BACK TO PITCHER \nRule 6.03(a)(3) (former Rule 6.06(c)): \nIf the batter interferes with the catcher's throw back to the pitcher by stepping out of the batter's box while at bat (no runners attempting to advance), it shall not be considered interference under Official Baseball Rule 6.03(a)(3) (former OBR 6.06(c)). In such cases, the umpire shall call \"Time\" only (no interference). \nThe ball is dead and no runner shall advance on the play. \nThis interpretation does not, of course, give the batter license to interfere intentionally with the catcher's throw back to the pitcher, and in such cases the batter shall be called out. If the batter becomes a runner on ball four and the catcher's throw strikes him or his bat, the ball remains alive and in play (provided no intentional interference by the batter-runner). \nIf the batter interferes with the catcher's throw to retire a runner by stepping out of the batter's box, interference shall be called on the batter under Official Baseball Rule 6.03(a)(3) (former OBR 6.06(c)). \nHowever, if the batter is standing in the batter's box and he or his bat is struck by the catcher's throw back to the pitcher (or throw in attempting to retire a runner) and, in the umpire's judgment, there is no intent on the part of the batter to interfere with the throw, the ball is alive and in play. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:09:19.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
