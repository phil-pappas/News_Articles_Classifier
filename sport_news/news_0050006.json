The Cougars’ reentry in the rankings comes after a 49-28 win over SMU Thursday night, its fourth double-digit win of the season and its third win of at least 21 points. Houston is one of 16 teams that remain undefeated, including three teams in The American Athletic Conference. Led by first year head coach Tom Herman, UH is one of just two teams with a head coach in his first year with the program, joining No. 8 Florida and Jim McElwain as the only other. The Cougars are getting it done in the trenches as they are the only team in the nation to rank in the top 10 in rushing offense (No. 8 – 287.2 yards per game) and rushing defense (No. 9 – 95.8 yards per game). Houston leads the nation in turnover margin (+2 per game) while ranking sixth in scoring offense (46.4 points per game) and total offense (573.4 yards per game). Houston quarterback Greg Ward Jr. ranks third nationally with 11 rushing touchdowns and second nationally with a 72.5 completion percentage. He is the only player in the nation to average over 200 yards per game passing and over 100 yards per game rushing. Junior linebacker Steven Taylor is second nationally with 12 tackles for loss and third nationally with eight sacks through five games. Houston was last ranked in the top 25 at the conclusion of the 2011 season when it finished No. 18 in the final AP poll of the year after a 13-1 finish with a win over Penn State in the TicketCity Bowl. Houston returns to action this Friday when it travels to New Orleans to take on Tulane. Kickoff is slated for 8 p.m. CT and the game will air on ESPNU and KPRC 950 AM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:03:43.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
