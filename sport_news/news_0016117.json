The four-year veteran Jayron Hosley will replace Amukamara. When Hosley has filled in for starting cornerbacks in previous seasons, he struggled to cover the top receivers of opposing teams. But this year, forced to fill in for the Giants’ other starting cornerback, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, he has fared much better.\n“We won a game when Hosley started at cornerback,” Coughlin said. “When he’s been out there, he’s done well.”\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage N.F.L.

Rueben Randle, who also injured his hamstring Sunday, practiced with the team. Middle linebacker Jon Beason, who sustained a concussion Sunday, and outside linebacker Devon Kennard, a defensive stalwart nursing a hamstring injury, did not practice. Wide receiver Victor Cruz, hobbled by a calf strain, was not at practice, and Coughlin said there was no update on when Cruz would begin working out.\nThe multitude of Giants injuries, especially in the wake of injury-filled seasons in 2013 and 2014, comes after the Giants revamped everything from their training methods to the players’ work schedule this spring and summer. But the injuries continue to mount.\n“We’ve inserted major changes, we’ve changed pretty much everything that we do, but all these soft tissue injuries are very, very troublesome,” Coughlin said. “Occurring in games, if you will. And then being so long and trying to get people back. I’m not going to get frustrated by it, but it’s very bothersome.”\nAsked if he was planning more adjustments to the Giants’ routine, Coughlin shook his head.\n“It’s not a time to change now,” he said. “For years we did it one way, we’re doing it this way, we’re going to stay with it. We’re going to see how it goes.”\nLoading... Go to Home Page »\nSite Index The New York Times News World U.S. Politics N.Y.
