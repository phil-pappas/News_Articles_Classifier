Most notably, wide receiver John Tsimis (lower body) has been ruled out for Saturday's home game against Michigan State (8 p.m., BTN) . \nTsimis missed most of training camp and the first two games of the season with a lower body injury. He made his debut in a 28-3 loss to Penn State on Sept. 19 and caught two passes for 10 yards. \nTsimis was not listed on the injury report before Rutgers' 27-14 win over Kansas before the bye, but he did not record a catch in the game. Tsimis had 19 catches for 188 yards and three touchdowns last season. \nFreshman cornerback Jarius Adams was added to the report with an upper body injury. The team's No. 3 cornerback, Adams is listed as questionable for the Michigan State game. With Adams' status in doubt, redshirt junior walk-on Brian Verbitski has been added to the two-deep behind starting corner Isaiah Wharton. \nPLUS: How big of an underdog is Rutgers against Michigan State? \nStarting strong safety Davon Jacobs again is listed as questionable with an upper body injury. Jacobs missed the Kansas game after being added to the injury report during the week . Redshirt freshman Kiy Hester is in line to start again in Jacobs' place. \n\"The injury report is what it is,\" interim coach Norries Wilson said. \"We're going to coach the guys that show up out there that the trainer staff and medical staff say are cleared to participate and we'll drive on from there.\" \nFour players were removed from the injury report: Running back Paul James, punter Tim Gleeson, wide receiver Jawuan Harris and offensive lineman Jacquis Webb. Harris and Webb had been listed as out with lower body injuries on every injury report this season. James, who has started all four games at running back, had been listed as probable with a lower body injury on previous reports. \nHere is the full injury report: \nOL Zack Heeman (Lower body): Probable \nCB Ronnie James (Lower body): Probable \nDE Djwany Mera (Lower body): Probable \nOL Chris Muller (Lower body): Probable \nDE Kemoko Turay (Upper body): Probable \nCB Jarius Adams (Upper body): Questionable \nSS Davon Jacobs (Upper body): Questionable \nTE George Behr (Lower body): Out \nWR Dontae Owens (Lower body): Out \nRB Desmon Peoples (Upper body): Out \nLB Nick Rafferty (Upper body): Out \nLB Austin Rosa (Lower body): Out \nRB Charles Snorweah (Upper body): Out \nWR John Tsimis (Lower body): Out \nDT Darius Hamilton (Lower body): Out for season \nLB T.J.
