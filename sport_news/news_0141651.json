But we showed tonight that on any given (Friday) night we can come out here and get a big win. I’m tickled to death for these players. \n…Our theme all year is to play ugly and try to win. We were able to do that tonight. – Barry Shuford, East Mecklenburg. \n“We just didn’t play well enough to win and that’s all I need to say. – Butler coach, Brian Hales, on the loss. \nRecords: East Mecklenburg 3-4 (1-1 in SW4A conference play); Butler 5-2, 1-1 in (Southwestern 4A (SW4A) conference play). \nWorth mentioning: East Mecklenburg kicker Christian Thomas is 6-for-6 on field goals on the season and has hit two 45-yard field goals, including the game-winner against Butler. The Eagles have won three of their last four games, with big wins over rivals Butler and Providence. The driving rain for most of the game definitely affected both teams’ offenses as the starting quarterbacks from Butler (Davis Cheek) and East Mecklenburg (Khalil Gilliam) went a combined 5-for-19 for 51 yards passing overall. \nWhat's Next: East Mecklenburg hosts Rocky River and Butler hosts Myers Park, both in SW4A conference battles next Friday.
