Fuente didn’t rule out Tate playing in the game at Raymond James Stadium.\nTate was clocked going 89 mph traveling eastbound on Poplar about 7:30 p.m. Friday. He was released on his own recognizance after appearing in General Sessions Court Monday morning. Tate, a 6-foot-4, 280-pound redshirt freshman from Houston, returned to practice later Monday and has worked out with the team this week.\nThere were no details on the warrants or when they were issued. The warrants are for violation of probation and a theft charge out of Harris County, Texas (Houston).\n“When he reported for the summer before his freshman year (in 2014), his parents made us aware of an issue when he was a minor,” Fuente said. “We decided to send him home (to address those issues) and he spent the summer in Houston where he had fines to pay, community service (to perform) and some meetings to attend. He and his family took care of the matter, but some of the meetings were transferred to Memphis.\n“Evidently, he missed some of those meetings. When he was pulled over (Friday), he was flagged as needing to be arrested because of the missed meetings with an officer of the court.”\nFuente said school officials and Tate are “in the process of getting the matter straightened out.” Tate's attorney, Leslie Ballin, is in contact with Tate's attorney in Texas to see if the warrant can be addressed there.\n“(Tate) will travel with the team and we will continue to monitor the situation,” Fuente said.\nFuente said Tate will face a to-be-determined team discipline. Tate has started the team's past two games at right tackle.\nAsked if Tate would play at South Florida, Fuente said: “I’m not saying he won’t play.”\n“Trevon is obviously embarrassed by the (incident) as am I,” Fuente said. “We will get it rectified. I have been in constant contact with the (university) president (M. David Rudd) and the athletic director (Tom Bowen). We are going to get all of this handled, we just have some things to work through.”\nTate made his debut in the second half of the U of M's season-opening win over Missouri State. He was among four players who missed the first half of the Missouri State game for their participation in a postgame brawl at last year's Miami Beach Bowl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:47:52.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
