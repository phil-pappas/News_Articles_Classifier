I remember when I first picked up a bow. I spent many hours practicing. Learning to make sligh adjustments to my gear so my arrow would fly true. All the time spent in the yard culminated with in my first trip to the woods to hunt. \nThe beginning hunter, no matter what species they chase, just wants nothing more than the opportunity to let the arrow fly or to pull the trigger. The hunter at the beginning of the life journey views success in terms of animals brought home. My first year hunting deer with a bow was one empty-handed trip after another. I missed a lot, set up in the wrong place, didn’t account for the wind. The list of mistakes is long and varied. But I learned. Eventually, I did have success and proudly brought home my first animal to show my family. It fed us and we were thankful. Then some years passed. \nI moved into what is considered the trophy phase. If I pulled an arrow back, it was either going to be for a doe to put on the table or for a giant buck. Nothing in between. This phase can vary in length for different people, but can consume a person. \nIt is in this phase that the hunter learns everything they can about their quarry. How it lives. Where it likes to hang out. How weather impacts travel. Information is consumed at a ravenous phase when someone is trying to claim bragging rights. After some time, bucks hang from the wall and the sportsman completes another phase and moves onto another. \nA person might realize spending time outdoors, regardless of bringing anything home, is a reward in itself. The quiet time spent with nature is enough. Sure, if a tag is successfully filled, life still is good. It no longer is about the end game, but about the pursuit and the pleasure of being close to nature. I found that this particular phase of a sportsman’s journey is fulfilling. The pressure to bring home something is gone and a stronger interest the purity of nature wells up from inside. \nAs time cruises by, the avid outdoor enthusiast enters one last stage. Years of knowledge and experiences rest inside. The past helps us, but the need to share this knowledge leaps to the forefront. The desire to see a child succeed reigns high on the list of important things. The challenge of taking a first-timer afield and passing on the information learned is the ultimate gift. \nThis last phase of being a sportsman is where things come full circle. The cycle continues. The passion is instilled in a new generation and our sports continue. \nWe all are somewhere along that journey. No one phase is better or more noble than the other. Each one has a purpose in creating a love for nature that is hard to explain. No matter where you are on your journey, enjoy it. \nGood luck this fall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:19:23.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
