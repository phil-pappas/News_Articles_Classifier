Then I would go away and spend the next few days trying to learn it.” \n“Playing for England was a good experience but Nigeria gave me a great opportunity to go and play for my home country, and also follow in the footsteps of my uncle, so I think that is going to be the pathway for me. \n“He (Jay Jayp) told me that if I played for Nigeria, I could become even better than him. To hear that was massive because he was a great player. He’s given me a challenge and I might have to accept it.” \nIwobi also added that he has his feet firmly on the ground and is focused on continuing to develop with Arsenal Under-21s after signing a contract extension with the Gunners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:59:42.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
