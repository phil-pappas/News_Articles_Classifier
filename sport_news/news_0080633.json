(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports)\nNEW YORK — Daniel Murphy has been many things for the New York Mets since he debuted in August 2008.\nHe's been a third baseman, stuck behind David Wright. He's been a first baseman, asked to fill the position when others failed or got hurt. He's been a second baseman who learned through painful experience how dangerous turning the double play can be. He's been a left fielder, mercifully briefly. He's been a line-drive hitter, a lighting rod for the things he cannot do on the baseball field, and more enjoyed than beloved by Mets fans, an imperfect player on imperfect teams.\nBut Daniel Murphy, constant reinventor through hard work and often external necessities of his team, is something new altogether. Murphy is the beloved, indispensable star of these New York Mets right now.\nMurphy homered against Jon Lester Saturday night, and his lunging grab in the bottom of the ninth inning preserved a 4-2 Game 1 NLCS win for the Mets over the Cubs.\nUSA TODAY\nHRs back Matt Harvey's gem, Mets top Cubs in Game 1 of NLCS\n“Sometimes on this team you can get overshadowed by all the stars that are here,” his manager, Terry Collins, said following the game. “In the past when Jose [Reyes] and Carlos [Beltran] and Johan [Santana], and David [Wright], I mean, there's been a host of guys that have come through here, and Dan Murphy has been that one steady guy that you look up, he plays hard. He's always coming through for you. He learned how to play second; he's done a good job. You put him at first, he never says a word. He's a baseball player. I'm not surprised at anything that he does.”\nThe best indication that he has been promoted by the fans came during introductions, when it was Murphy — not Wright, not Game 1 starter Matt Harvey or beloved Jacob deGrom — who received the loudest cheers.\nAnd when Murphy took a 1-1 cutter from Lester and lined it over the right field fence, the reaction seemed to be a healthy mix of admiration for what Murphy was doing this postseason—a group of fans in the upper deck channeled Wayne's World and saluted Murphy, “we're not worthy”-style — with sheer delight that Murphy, of all the Mets, is turning into the most dangerous, feared hitter on this team in October.\nFOR THE WIN\nDaniel Murphy has three homers against lefties this postseason after hitting only one all year\nA man who hit one home run against lefties all season has three in this postseason, and they've come against Clayton Kershaw twice and now Jon Lester. His fourth home run this October, against a righty, provided the margin of victory in a deciding game and bested Zack Greinke.\nNo one is enjoying it more than Murphy.\n“Tomorrow has enough worry for itself,” Murphy said of his approach. “So really try and enjoy the moment. We worked so hard to get here. Enjoy it now that we're here. So why not enjoy it while we're here? I'm going to enjoy this win tonight. Go see my son and my wife. And we'll get ready for tomorrow. But this was a sweet win.”\nIt is that combination of preparation and serendipity that allowed Murphy to make that final defensive play, with the Cubs' Tommy La Stella up against Jeurys Familia as the game's tying run.\nUSA TODAY\nMets to start rookie Noah Syndergaard in Game 2 of NLCS\n“Tommy La Stella, he's from Atlanta so we have an idea,” Murphy said. “We played against him last year all season. He's a really good hitter. Stays on the ball well, and Familia right there went to the splitter, so I think I gave him about a half step step to the pull side of the 3/4 hole, and it ended up being just enough to get there. But Tommy's a really good hitter. He stays on the ball well. If you throw it away, he's going to hit it away. And I was hoping that he'd be cheating to the heater, and that the splitter would kind of he'd hook it a little bit, and I just happened to be in the right spot.”\nThat is the story, writ large, of Murphy's moment. It is impossible to cover the Mets for any length of time without picking up stories, told or seen, about how much Murphy works at his craft, notable even within a sport where constant effort is the common theme that gets players to the major leagues in the first place.\nNow he's in New York, and the hottest of his hot streaks is coming in the most important games his Mets have played in a decade.\nUSA TODAY\nJon Lester on the Cubs' loss in Game 1: 'They found holes'\nAnd Murphy says he keeps on feeding off the fans who appreciate him as never before.\n“I thought the fans were unbelievable tonight. They've been so this entire year, and then even really starting in that Washington series at the trade deadline, I think they've been awesome,” Murphy said, sitting next to Matt Harvey at his postgame presser. “It's definitely nice to feed off of that, I think, as a player. I think you can ask Matt over here, but when you've got 40,000 people behind you, I think it zeros in your focus a little bit and it helps you to, I think, focus on the task at hand, which is that pitch and executing that pitch at that time.”\nHarvey knows what it feels like, but Harvey's known for years.\nIt's Daniel Murphy's turn to find out how to navigate the spotlight. So far, it's going quite well.\nPHOTOS: METS VS. CUBS IN NLCS\nGame 1 in New York. The Mets celebrate their 4-2 victory over the Cubs.
