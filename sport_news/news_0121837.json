The top eight qualify, although Serena's withdrawal ensures that the ninth-place finisher in the calendar-year standings will also make the field in tennis' fifth most prestigious event. \nVenus Williams survived slugfests against Johanna Konta and Roberta Vinci the previous two days -- Vinci was the player who stunned Serena Williams at the U.S. Open -- to make the final in Wuhan. \nAt 35, her body held up more than the 21-year-old Muguruza's. \nMuguruza, however, is expected to climb to fifth in the calendar-year standings, significantly boosting her chances of appearing at the WTA Finals for the first time. \nMore points are on offer at this week's China Open, the last big women's tournament ahead of Singapore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:26:01.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
