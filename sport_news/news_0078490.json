On Tuesday, they received a 22-save performance from Carolyn Alcantara and tied River Dell’s solid squad on a second-half Kennedy Avon goal.\n“We’ve been improving every game,” coach Scott Davis said. “Monday’s mind-set was maybe not so great within the team because we were missing a few starters, but Tuesday’s tie shows our potential.\n“In our mind-set we’re just trying to be in the games.”\nBERGEN COUNTY TOURNAMENT: Here is a look at the quarterfinal matchups:\n(8) Hackensack at (1) Ramsey, Saturday, 11 a.m. \nHackensack has struggled with inexperience while Ramsey’s players have played together for years. This one may not be close, but will be a good barometer for Hackensack’s ability and Ramsey’s mental focus. Kassidy Shetler’s 21 goals lead Ramsey while Kennedy Avon, Tashee Brown and Karina Sitchon each have scored one for Hackensack.\n(7) River Dell at (2) Northern Highlands, Sunday, 3:15 p.m. \nRiver Dell’s winless record is deceptive, as the Golden Hawks have not surrendered more than two goals in all but two games: one against Ramsey, the other against Northern Highlands. River Dell’s 6-0 loss to the Highlanders in the season opener is a distant memory for the Golden Hawks. River Dell’s scoring leader is Kim Lewis (two goals) while Highlands’ is Gabby Pontone (12).\n(6) NV/Demarest at (3) Westwood, Sunday, noon \nThis intriguing contest features hungry teams who have not won many games, but have ability. Demarest is led by Ali Hsueh (4G). Westwood, led in scoring by Samantha Hywel (3G), is focused on playing hard for 60 minutes.\n(5) Dwight-Englewood at (4) NV/Old Tappan, Sunday, noon \nThis rematch is the most interesting of the matchups as neither team scored in their Oct. 1 game. Jillian Johnson leads NV/Old Tappan with three goals while Sydney Zahn leads the Bulldogs with three.\nPASSAIC COUNTY TOURNAMENT: Pompton Lakes defeated West Milford, 1-0, on an Amanda Fermin goal Tuesday in a game that was scheduled as a regular-season contest but instead will serve as one of the Passaic County semifinals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:37:22.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
