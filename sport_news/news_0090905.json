It makes them feel better about everything that we're doing. Everything. \n\"Don't forget what it took to get to this point,\" he added. \"We want to keep doing that. Most people, they get complacent, 'Oh, things are going good, great, just relax.' That's how how you got here.\" \nThe Tar Heels have reeled off five straight wins since that befuddling loss to South Carolina in the opener, and are coming off a 50-14 rout of Wake Forest in which they had three touchdowns that covered at least 30 yards. \n\"They are probably one of the most, per-possession, explosive teams that are out there,\" Virginia coach Mike London said. \"They'll throw the long ball on you. They'll make those types of throws, and I think they have those types of athletes that can go get it.\" \nNorth Carolina is the only one-loss team from one of the five major conferences that isn't in the Top 25. \nMeanwhile, Virginia has struggled against a brutal schedule, and its four losses have come to teams that either were or are ranked: \nthen-No. 13 UCLA, then-No. 9 Notre Dame, a Boise State team that spent a few weeks in the polls and a Pittsburgh team that debuted in the rankings this week. The Cavaliers are coming off a 44-38, triple-overtime victory over Syracuse. \n\"When I look at that film, I'm saying that's a good football team that's coming in here,\" Fedora said. \n___ \nSome things to know about the Virginia-North Carolina game: \nSWITCHING SIDES: Virginia WR T.J. Thorpe spent the past four injury-riddled years at North Carolina before joining the Cavaliers as a graduate transfer. He started the last three games and caught a 75-yard touchdown passes against Boise State. \nNO Q'S ABOUT QUISE: North Carolina QB Marquise Williams has had a hand in 76 career touchdowns — three shy of the school record set by Darian Durant in 2004. He accounted for four — three passing, one rushing — in the Wake Forest win and is the league's No. 9 rusher as well as its No. 6 passer. \nDIZZYING MIZZELL: Virginia's Taquan Mizzell leads the nation's running backs with 409 yards, and he has 35 catches — second among players at his position. He's the only running back with a pair of 100-yard receiving performances, doing it against UCLA and William & Mary. \nTOUGH MATCHUP: The Tar Heels have the ACC's best offense, leading the league in total yardage (482 ypg) and scoring (40.5 ppg), and last week Williams threw two long touchdown passes to former walk-on WR Mack Hollins. They could make things tough on a Virginia pass defense that ranks last in the league, allowing an average of 252 yards through the air. \nGREAT START: North Carolina is looking for just its second 3-0 start to league play since 1983. The Tar Heels last did it under Mack Brown in 1997, starting 5-0 in the ACC while cracking the top five in the national polls. \n___ \nFollow Joedy McCreary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joedyap \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
