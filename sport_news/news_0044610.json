It's the second game Warford has missed this season after sitting out Week 1 with the ankle problem. The Lions will start Manny Ramirez at right guard and go with rookie Laken Tomlinson at left guard. \nThe Lions are also without defensive leader DeAndre Levy, missing his fourth straight game. Levy was a limited participant in practice this week, but was downgraded to out Sunday. \nSeattle was without Marshawn Lynch and Brandon Mebane, who were ruled out Sunday. It'll be just the second game Lynch has missed since arriving in Seattle. Starting linebacker Bruce Irvin was active despite showing up on the final injury report as questionable with an ankle injury. \nAP NFL websites: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
