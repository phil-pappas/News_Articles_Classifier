He likes the way we play the game and because of that, he has shown a real enthusiasm to come and play for the club. \n\"He's a player who will give us another option in the forward areas and I'm sure the squad are looking forward to working with him. \n\"We've got plenty of games coming up which will be crucial to us maintaining our early-season form and I'm looking forward to seeing Joe in action for the Sky Blues.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:27:40.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
