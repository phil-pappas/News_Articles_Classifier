He threw seven shutout innings in a 5-0 win. (Photo: AP) \nSAN DIEGO — Zach Davies pitched seven innings and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the San Diego Padres 5-0 on Wednesday night. \nDavies (3-2) did not allow a run for a second consecutive start, having shut out the Chicago Cubs over six innings in his last outing. He struck out six and walked two. \nHernan Perez and Martin Maldonado drove in two runs each in the Brewers’ five-run sixth inning. Perez and Maldonado had two hits apiece. \nThe shutout is the seventh of the season for Milwaukee, which has won five of its last seven games. \nSan Diego starter Andrew Cashner (6-16) struck out four of the first five batters in the game, but left after allowing five consecutive hitters to reach in the fifth. He gave up five runs and nine hits, while striking out seven and walking two. \nPadres outfielder Justin Upton left the game in the first inning after crashing into the wall while fielding a ground ball near the third base line. Upton remained on the ground following the collision and was helped off the field. \nSan Diego has lost three straight and four of five, and was shut out for the 19th time this season. \nTRAINER’S ROOM \nPadres: OF Matt Kemp (finger) will need 4-to-6 weeks to recover from a right middle finger strain and will not play again this season. \nUP NEXT \nBrewers: RHP Taylor Jungmann (9-7, 3.64) lost his last start in St. Louis after allowing six runs in five innings. He has not won a start since Sept. 3 against Pittsburgh. \nPadres: RHP Ian Kennedy (8-15, 4.38) takes the mound for San Diego following an outing in which he allowed four runs over five innings to San Francisco but did not factor in the decision. Kennedy has lost four straight.
