The Panthers have 14 goals in four games while allowing five. It's the second-best goal differential (plus-9) in the NHL. (Harvey Fialkov) \nBuilt similarly at 6 foot 3 and 213 pounds, Barkov also protects the puck like a mother hen protects her chick. And with Jagr urging him to shoot more, the centerman is putting a lot more pucks on net this season. He has six shots on goal in each of the last two games, giving him a team-leading 16. \n\"I didn't have a lot of shots last year. But this year I try to shoot more,\" Barkov said. \"I think I had six shots last game; that's good. \n\"It's a lot of fun to play that's why we all three feel pretty confident. That's why I worked hard this summer. I want to play a lot of minutes and try to produce and try to defend well.\" \nIn Thursday's 3-2 victory over the Sabres, Barkov's slick, cross-crease saucer pass right to Jagr's stick resulted in a first-period power-play goal. With the Sabres closing to 2-1, Barkov steered in a rebound off Jagr's shot for the clinching goal on another power play in the third period. \nHe also helped kill off five of Buffalo's six power plays, an added role he has assumed this year and why he leads all Panthers forwards in time-on-ice at 19:19 per game. \n\"The first time I saw him I'm, 'that could be a young Hossa,' \"Panthers coach Gerard Gallant said of Blackhawks forward Marian Hossa, who has helped Chicago win three Stanley Cup titles. \"He's a big, strong guy; he handles the puck well. Obviously, Hossa had great years and won some Cups and got a lot of points. That's the player we'd love him to be. \n\"[Usually] kids that age come into the NHL and their offensive skills are there, but they don't play well defensively. But this kid has defensive skills first and offensive skills second. â€¦ You could tell the kid's father was a coach because he taught the kid to play the game the right way on both ends of the rink.\" \nPanthers goalie Roberto Luongo has a perfect perch to observe Barkov. \n\"Other than his skills he's got great hockey sense. He's in the right place at the right time, not only in the offensive zone but in the defensive zone,\" Luongo said. \"It's scary to think at his age that he's so good already and what he can do as he gets older.\" \nGill named manager of player development \nPanthers general manager Dale Tallon announced that former NHL defenseman Hal Gill will be the team's manager of player development and work closely with Bryan McCabe , the director of player development. \nGill, 40, has played 1,108 games and recorded 36 goals and 184 points with 962 penalty minutes for six different teams. He won a Stanley Cup with the Penguins in 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:57:24.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
