Community College. Now, at age 58, he’s in his 22nd season running up and down the sideline at Michigan Stadium as a member of the chain crew. A U-M employee and Wolverines fan, he said he has “the best seat in the house — even though you have to stand.” (Photo: Julian H.

Just like it was memorable two games earlier. Wallace was on the Colorado sideline when quarterback Kordell Stewart’s Hail Mary hauled in by Michael Westbrook silenced more than 106,000 people in the “Miracle at Michigan.” \n“I never dreamed I’d be doing the chains for the football games,” said Wallace of Canton, who is frequently asked whether he can get people on the field and for tickets. “The best seat in the house — even though you have to stand.” \nWallace grew up in Ann Arbor, a three-sport athlete at Huron High who played a bit of college football at Olivet and Scottsdale (Ariz.) Community College. \nNow 21 years after his first season working the chains, Wallace will be on the home sideline — he switched spots in 2000, now moving to hold the auxiliary down box — for another Michigan-Michigan State game, an anonymous face in the center of the action. \nHe will roll in around 9 a.m. Saturday for the 3:30 p.m. game and wander the parking lots and tailgates. He will visit friends and enjoy the atmosphere until work begins. \nAlthough an extension of the game officials, Wallace and the other nine members of the chain crew are hired and paid by Michigan, a practice not uncommon in college football. They are free to wear whatever they want until dressing for the game. So he proudly sports a U-M pullover or shirt, no hiding his allegiance. \nBut about an hour before game time, he and the rest of the crew will change at the Crisler Center into their uniform: a “Michigan Chain Crew” top, the same black pants as the game officials, a Big Ten vest and a Big Ten cap. \nAn hour before the game, the crew will meet with game officials, and the head linesman lays out the various mechanics. Most of the crew knows most of what’s coming. A few have been doing it 30 years. But some details vary. \n“When we’re on the field, the officials will always tell us, ‘Don’t let us screw up,’” said Phil Boham, Wallace’s friend and another chain crew member. “‘Bring it up. We’re not opposed to understanding we make a mistake.’ I think that’s the respect for the chain crew.” \nOnce the game begins, Wallace’s biggest job is to stay engaged. As a longtime football official, that’s where the rules come in, understanding when to flip to the next down and when to wait for a signal. When the ball is snapped, his role is to stand at the line of scrimmage until the play is whistled dead or, in case of penalty, returned to where he is. \n“I’m the previous spot, in case they have to come back to it,” he said. \nThis means occasionally he’s showing one down while the primary down box on the other side of the field already has switched the number. In those situations, the students usually call him out, not understanding the mechanics. He can only bite his tongue. \nIf the play goes downfield, he has to hustle to the next line of scrimmage. \nThat’s where his physical fitness enters. \n“It could be a 95-yard run, and I’m still on the previous spot at the 5-yard line. I don’t get to move until the ball is ready for play, and I’ve got to run that whole yards,” he said, recalling a time when Denard Robinson did just that, ending up short of the end zone. \nIt’s motivation enough for him to stay in shape, taking long walks twice daily from his job as a building facilities manager of two U-M dorms, Mosher-Jordan and Stockwell. \nHe has seen his share in the U-M/MSU rivalry, including U-M’s three-overtime 2004 victory, which he recalled as a Rose Bowl-type setting. It began in the late afternoon and wound into MSU’s 27-10 fourth-quarter lead with just under 9 minutes remaining before ending with Braylon Edwards’ game-winning touchdown catch and run in the third overtime. \nGiven Wallace’s sideline spot, few may have seen it better. \nIt’s not always perfect. On plays to the far side of the field, it makes more sense for him to watch the video board instead of the field. \n“I love the University of Michigan, and the hardest part of doing the chains is not being able to cheer,” Wallace said. “Because we’re an extension of the officials, and you don’t want to see the chain crew jumping up and down and cheering, especially if you’re on the visitors sideline. You might get cold-cocked by one of the coaches or something.” \nBeing down on the sideline allows insight unavailable from a distance. \nHis friend Boham, who has about 10 extra years on Wallace, recalls years ago when Bo Schembechler was infuriated with a call and asked him what he thought. As someone who revered Schembechler, he reluctantly agreed but knew he was better off not speaking. \nThe best way to keep this job: Do it with your mouth closed. \nThat has helped make this season exciting for the chain crew — passionate Michigan fans away from the field, silent observers on the field. \n“The only thing I can see that coach (Jim) Harbaugh has brought is intensity, toughness and organization,” Wallace said. “That’s not anything against Brady (Hoke) or Rodriguez. They didn’t win; he’s winning. The organization (is better) when the players are just in their positions.” \nThese are the discussions among the crew members. Boham noticed the same. \n“What we all are seeing now that we didn’t see in the past few years is these kids are being coached on every single play,” Boham said. “They’re not being belittled. They’re not being yelled at. They’re being coached.” \nWhile Saturday will be the next step in Wallace’s career, all stadium eyes will focus on the down number above his head, not the man beneath it. \nBut when a tailback in maize-and-blue or green-and-white rips off a long run and parts of the crowd are going wild, go easy on the guy who is still standing way behind the play, sometimes with what appears to be the wrong number at the top of the stick. \nJust part of the job. \nMark Snyder is a reporter at the Detroit Free Press, contact him at msnyder@freepress.com.
