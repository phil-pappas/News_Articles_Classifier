Well, they're alive and kicking, quite hard. And it's long over due for a progress report.\nIn the last diary entry , we talked about why gender matters when growing marijuana and learned the gender of our two seedlings: one boy and one girl.\nSince then, they've continued to grow (like weeds) all thanks to some basic maintenance tips from my marijuana growing mentor, weed-geek, commercial grower, Farma dispensary co-owner and (insert many other hats here), Jeremy Plumb.\nToday, I want to share a few tips on basic marijuana plant maintenance: watering, bending and pruning.\nThe art of watering\nHow to water marijuana plants Farma dispensary co-owner, Jeremy Plumb, shows us how to make the most of tap water when watering marijuana plants.\nLike most plants, Jeremy said you want to water when the top few inches of soil start to look dry. If you're growing in pots, they may feel lighter weight than usual. That means the plants are thirsty.\nTheoretically, growers can achieve good results with tap water. But if we're talking 'art' here Jeremy suggests prepping your tap water first. How?\nOxygenate your water Fill a bucket or large container with tap water. Stir vigorously for about five minutes. The tiny bubbles produced help oxygen enter the water and release chlorine. Water the plants until you start to see water dripping into the saucer. In the video above, we also added an organic plant-based fertilizer that comes in a dark gray powder. It's called Brilliant Black and sells in a big jar, but we only used about a tablespoon at the first watering for each plant. This step is optional. If you want to get really fancy, you could also let your water sit overnight with an aquarium pump bubbling into the water. A little too fancy for my blood. Bending\nMarijuana plant maintenance: Bending and pruning tutorial Pot plants have the tendency to shoot straight up like a beanpole. And with only one dominant branch, harvest is limited. Here we learn a technique called 'bending' that creates multiple dominant branches for a larger harvest.\nMost marijuana plants tend to shoot straight up like a beanpole, with one dominant branch supporting all the smaller branches and leaves. But one dominant branch, means less harvest. So Jeremy showed me a technique called 'bending', which encourages multiple dominant branches.\n(Watch the marijuana maintenance video above to see how it's done.)\nPruning\nThis one's somewhat self-explanatory. Cut off smaller leaves towards the bottom of the plant so energy isn't spent on areas that won't likely produce flower.\n(Watch the marijuana maintenance video above to see how it's done.)\nTo follow our progress, check out our live stream. And apologies in advance, it can be finicky sometimes.\nHappy growing!\nTeresa\n--\nPot Grow Diary: Day 1 | The Oregonian grows weed.
