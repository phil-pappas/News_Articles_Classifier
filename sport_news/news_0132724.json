(Photo: D.A Robin/Democrat) Man on fire \nLincoln running back Denzel Washington has seen his carries go up as the season progressed, but the hot hand in previous weeks had been Diamonds Haynes. \nWith Haynes not playing and season starter Ricky Henrilus still working back from injury, Washington got a heavy load. \nHis first carry was a 52-yard scamper up the middle, setting up Henrilus' 1-yard touchdown to cap the. Quick two-play opening drive.

About the only thing he didn't do was score, but his chunks of yardage allowed Lincoln quarterback Chris Brimm to play patiently. \n\"We knew we had to come out strong and physical and set the tone from the start,\" Washington said. \"If we're running well it takes pressure off him and he doesn't feel like he has to throw the ball every play.\" Buy Photo \nLeon High wide receiver J'air Jones tries to run through a wall of Lincoln High defenders.

Robin/Democrat) Star of the game \nLincoln safety Vincent Johnson has had a rough go of it in the return game the last few weeks. \nAgainst Chiles, Johnson had four long returns but three, including one for a touchdown, were called back for block-in-the-back penalties. \nThe one that wasn't a penalty was getting tripped by Chiles' kicker at the 8, short of a game-winning touchdown. The Trojans botched a game-tying field goal immediately after. \nSo when Johnson wiggled his way out of traffic and returned a punt for a 58-yard touchdown in the first quarter, it was only fitting that there was indeed a flag on the play. \n\"Coach always says big-time players come up big in big-time games,\" Johnson said. \"He says, 'Better well done than well said.' We know we've just got to keep pushing for the playoffs. In the playoffs, it's a brand new season. Everyone is 0-0. You've then just got to make a run.\" \nTo Johnson's credit, he came back with perhaps the game's biggest play— ripping a ball away from Leon receiver Jacob Owens on a pass to the end zone. \nJohnson's interception with 31 seconds remaining and a 14-0 Lincoln lead halted the Lions' chances at flipping momentum. \n\"That really changed the game because they were getting the ball in the second half,\" Shakir said. \"It was really important. He just loves the game and plays so hard. You can't find a better all-around kid. He is an encyclopedia when it comes to football. He loves it.\" Buy Photo \nLincoln safety Vincent Johnson returns a punt for a touchdown, but the play was called back by penalty. Johnson later recorded a big interception as the Trojans won 21-7. (Photo: D.A. Robin/Democrat) Odell who? \nLincoln receiver Fred Daughtry only caught two balls all night, but both went for touchdowns. \nDaughtry turned a short 5-yard pass into a 22-yard touchdown with a stutter and a burst up the middle in the second quarter. \nBut after Leon put together a third-quarter scoring drive to pull within a score, Daughtry made a signature play. \nOn third-and-goal from the Leon 7, Brimm rolled right and threw a pass to Daughtry in the back of the end zone. \nOnly it appeared as if it was going to sail out out bounds. \nThat's when Daughtry mimicked New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. with a leaping one-handed snag. \n\"I'm just speechless after that catch and all I could do was thank God,\" said Daughtry, who excitedly ran towards his bench and flipped the ball high towards the ref. \"I just focused on the ball, that was it. I jumped and looked it all the way in. I brung it down for a touchdown.\" Buy Photo \nLincoln receiver Fred Daughtry lands after catching a touchdown pass in the third quarter of a 21-7 win over Leon.

(Photo: D.A Robin/Democrat) Thomas returns from injury \nLeon running back Sam Thomas envisioned a different season than he had to this point. \nThomas damaged his right knee ligaments severely in the first game of the year and has been sitting every since. \nHe returned in a limited role last week, but against the Lions' bitter rival, he acted as if he was in mid-season form with no injury at all. \nThomas carried 16 times for 105 yards. He caught three passes for 35 yards, and his 6-yard touchdown run in the third quarter gave life to his team. \n\"It's not all me,\" Thomas said. \"I thank my offensive line and my fullback for blocking and getting me so many yards. I'm just trying to help my team to win. We pushed through and fought, it just didn't come out the way I expected. But we played a hard game.\" Buy Photo \nLeon running back Sam Thomas looks back at fallen teammates moments after crossing into the end zone for a third-quarter touchdown.
