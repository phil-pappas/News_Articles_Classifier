So say the votes of the coaches and assorted media members in the league’s preseason polls, as E.C. Matthews and Hassan Martin have been named All-Conference First Team and the Rams have been chosen second among the A-10’s 14 teams. URI’s dynamic pair join Davidson’s Jack Gibbs, La Salle’s Jordan Price and Saint Joseph’s DeAndre’ Bembry — all juniors — in making up the first team, with the Rams trailing only Dayton in the standings. URI received eight first-place votes to the Flyers’ 12 but trailed by just five points overall, 352-347. It matches the predicted second-place finish the Rams were tabbed for in 2007-08, a season in which URI lost eight of its last nine and ultimately missed the NCAA Tournament. “We’re really, really hungry,” URI coach Dan Hurley said. “We don’t allow ourselves to feel like people have a bull’s eye on us right now. There’s no target on us — we haven’t accomplished anything that we want to accomplish as of yet.” Matthews overcame left foot and right pinkie injuries to average 16.9 points per game as a sophomore, following up on a strong debut season that earned him co-Rookie of the Year honors with Bembry. Bettering his efficiency will be a primary goal for Matthews in his third year with the Rams — he shot just 41.0 percent from the field and committed 3.6 turnovers per game in 2014-15. “I think he’s focused on becoming a great all-around guard,” Hurley said. “He’s not thinking about being a high-scoring shooting guard. He’s not thinking about leading the A-10 in scoring. He’s thinking about becoming a great guard.” Martin ranked in the league’s top 10 in rebounding (eighth), field-goal percentage (first) and blocked shots (first) last season, emerging as one of the league’s most dominant post players while averaging 11.4 points per game. Struggles at the foul line were the one glaring hole in Martin’s game — he shot just 60.9 percent in 240 trips. “He’s an elite defender nationally,” Hurley said. “Tremendous rebounder. Great, competitive guy. He plays hard. Really, it’s just putting him in positions in terms of developing his skills where he could play out to the 3-point line.” Martin’s 3.1 blocked shots per game also merited his inclusion on the Preseason All-Defensive Team. His presence in the paint anchored one of the top units in the nation, as URI ranked ninth according to kenpom.com in adjusted defensive efficiency. The Rams allowed just 91.3 points per 100 possessions last season while holding opponents to a nation-leading 26.5 percent from 3-point range. Page 2 of 2 - Matthews and Martin reunite with sophomore guards Jarvis Garrett and Jared Terrell on a starting unit that propelled URI to third place last season and a bye to the A-10 quarterfinals. The Rams downed George Washington at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center — their first conference tournament win since 2010-11 — before falling to Dayton in the semifinals. The additions of Memphis transfer Kuran Iverson and Towson fifth-year transfer Four McGlynn give URI experienced, talented depth pieces that could end an NCAA Tournament drought stretching back to 1999. “We want to break through,” Hurley said. “We feel like we brought back a lot of key players. We feel like we’ve matured as a program.” Davidson’s Brian Sullivan, George Mason’s Shevon Thompson, St. Bonaventure’s Marcus Posley and George Washington’s Patricio Garino and Kevin Larsen — all seniors — make up the All-Conference Second Team. Thompson’s 11.3 rebounds per game led the A-10 last season while Posley’s 16.7 points per game ranks him fourth among returning players. Dayton’s Kendall Pollard joins Richmond pair Terry Allen and ShawnDre’ Jones and VCU twosome Melvin Johnson and Mo-Alie Cox on the All-Conference Third Team. Pollard (Most Improved Player) and Jones (Sixth Man of the Year) were both postseason award winners in 2014-15. Martin is joined on the All-Defensive team by Bembry, Garino, Cox and Fordham’s Mandell Thomas. Bembry and Garino each ranked in the top four in steals per game while Thomas led the league at 2.4. Cox, a 6-foot-6, 250-pound bruiser, blocked 1.9 shots per game to rank second only to Martin among returning players. Davidson — the regular-season winner in its A-10 debut after moving from the Southern Conference last year — was picked third and garnered six first-place votes. George Washington received the other first-place vote to slide into fourth while VCU — the conference tournament winner last season — was picked fifth. Richmond and Saint Joseph’s round out the top half while St. Bonaventure, La Salle, Massachusetts, Duquesne, Saint Louis, George Mason and Fordham make up the projected bottom half of the standings. One notable omission from the all-conference teams is Dayton senior forward Dyshawn Pierre, who isn’t currently enrolled at the school amid an investigation into a May sexual assault allegation by a fellow student. Pierre was suspended in September and a federal court judge ruled against a request for a temporary restraining order that would have allowed Pierre to return to school and the team on Tuesday. -bkoch@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:54:51.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
