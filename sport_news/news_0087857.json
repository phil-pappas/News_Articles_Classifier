It was \"an average team at best\" back then, she said.\nBut she has watched the program blossom into a perennial winner under her wing. And the fourth-year coach might be doing some of her finest work to date.\nThe Aviators are 9-3, with competitive losses to Waldwick, Nutley and Paramus. They are 9-0 in the NJIC Meadowlands Division, putting them over halfway home to another league championship.\nAnd they’re doing so after being ravaged by injuries to five starters, including a sprained ankle suffered by Jillian DiGiacinto. The versatile senior, an All-Bergen sprinter in track, led the team with 10 goals before being injured Sept. 30. Pair that with head injuries to Amanda Ortiz, Amanda DeJulia and Sydney Fontalvo and an early-season injury to Jailene Jironza, and that’s usually the recipe for disaster at a Group 1 school.\nNot so in Hasbrouck Heights’ case. The Aviators just keep on winning.\n\"I don’t think of it as being tougher this year,\" said Jones, who added she was proud of the way her team performed — while missing four starters — in its 2-0 loss to Paramus in the opening round of the Bergen County tournament.\n\"We’ve had the opportunity to get younger kids some great experience, and the young kids are the future of the program. The sooner we can get them in and learning, the better.\n\"You hear coaches talk about the head injuries all the time. This is the first year we’re going through it, but everyone’s going to be missing pieces to the puzzle. We’ve had some great depth come up that most small schools don’t have.\"\nWith DiGiacinto — who was capable of playing a number of positions — still rehabbing her ankle, senior center-midfielder Tori Barris (10 goals, seven assists) and freshman Serena Torres (seven goals) have stepped up in her absence. Senior sweeper Felicia Cascione also has gotten involved offensively, with four goals and four assists.\nOrtiz, DeJulia and Fontalvo are expected back as soon as this week. Others have gained valuable experience while Hasbrouck Heights has maintained its winning ways.\nThere’s a standard to live up to now in the Aviators’ program. And Jones has been at the forefront of the recent success.\n\"Winning the league is the expectation; it’s kind of the norm now,\" Jones said. \"It’s not, ‘Oh, let’s try to win the league.’ It’s ‘We have to win the league and we have to go undefeated, we’re not losing.’ That’s the mentality.\n\"And for the younger kids, this is their normal. They’re used to seeing the older girls win and now are a part of it. There are high standards.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:17:48.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
