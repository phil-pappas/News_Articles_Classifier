The sophomore returned his second interception 40 yards for a touchdown with 34.5 seconds left as the Panthers downed Southwest 14-0 at The Corral in the East Central 2-A Conference opener for both teams Friday night. “It’s real big, it’s real big,” said Hall, who is also East Duplin’s starting quarterback. “We’re trying to go undefeated in conference.” Hall’s second interception came on a trick play by Southwest, with quarterback, Deaje’ Foskey making as if he was running to the sideline. Instead, however, he raced out for a pass from running back J.Q. Gonzalez, who also plays quarterback. The 6-foot, 165-pound Hall stepped in front of Foskey at the SWO 40-yard line and sprinted down the sideline was able to get into the end zone as a would-be tackler tried to pull him down. “I knew they had a play (on),” Hall said. “I was trying to figure out why he (Foskey) went to the sideline so fast. So I was like, something’s coming. So I was ready and looking. They threw the ball and I was like, Oh, yeah, it’s mine, and I caught it. “I really didn’t think I was going to score. I thought that boy was going to get me.” SWO coach Charlie Dempsey said the field position wasn’t the best to use the trick play, but down a touchdown with time running out he felt it was the right moment to pull it out. “That’s something we’ve been practicing for about four weeks, just waiting for the opportune time,” he said. “I figured if I was ever going to catch them sleeping ... being down 6-0 was the time to do it. We had about 70 yards to go in less than a minute, and we’re not the type of offense that’s a no-huddle, two-minute offense. That was the time to do it.” The touchdown came on a night when touchdowns were scarce. The only other came on East Duplin’s opening drive of the second half when Chris Benson’s 3-yard run capped a 10-play, 58-yard drive that included an 11-yard run by Tyran Outlaw on third-and-4 at the 14. The extra point was blocked, but East Duplin led 6-0 with 7:27 left in the third quarter. “We wanted to come out and score early and try to get some momentum going on offense,” East Duplin coach Battle Holley said. “We had a good drive there.” Page 2 of 3 - East Duplin (5-2, 1-0), which ran 11 more plays (49 to 38) and had about six more minutes of possession time than Southwest, finished with 185 yards total offense. Southwest (3-4, 0-1) had 172 yards, and just 66 yards in the second half. Of that, 45 yards came on SWO’s final possession after Hall’s interception with the Panthers in a prevent defense. Southwest’s best scoring opportunity probably came on its third possession of the opening half. On second-and-8 at the SWO 18, the speedy Gonzalez broke off a 35-yard run up the middle and seemed headed for the end zone until Cameron caught him from behind at the East Duplin 47. SWO got to the 36 before an 8-yard loss forced the Stallions to punt. “I knew I was going to get him,” Hall said. “They said, ‘Nothing behind me,’ so nothing got behind me. He got behind me, but I got him down.” Southwest never got inside the East Duplin 31. “This (defensive effort) rated at least an eight,” Hall said. Holley certainly liked what he saw from his defense, which along with the two takeaways had five stops for negative yards and five more for 1 yard or less. “They got after the football,” he said. “We bent but didn’t break.” Possessions were at a premium. The clock rarely stopped because the teams combined to run the ball 72 times while passing just 15 times. Also, they combined for only six penalties in a game that lasted just under two hours. It was a old-timey, hard-nosed defensive battle in an era of spread offenses and up-and-down the field offensive shootouts, with Southwest’s defense equal to the task, slowing down the Panthers, who had scored 134 points in their last two games. “I’m proud of the way we played, we just ran out of gas,” Dempsey said. “Our guys stayed on defense so much, and our defense played great. They played really hard. But (having too many players going both ways because of injuries), when we got back on offense our guys were just gased and they had more in the tank than we did. “I felt good first half the way we were moving the ball offensively. We really were doing some good things. We’ve just got to be able to finish. But hat’s off to East Duplin. They did a great job defensively.” East Duplin 0 0 6 8 — 14 Southwest 0 0 0 0 — 0 Third Quarter ED – Benson 3 run (kick blocked), 7:27 Fourth Quarter ED – Hall 40 interception return (Howard pass from Hall), 34.5 ED SWO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:25:17.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
