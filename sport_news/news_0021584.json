With the five-match series tied at 2-2, de Villiers won the toss and opted to bat in the hot and humid conditions. He could not have been happier at the close of their innings as his team matched their second highest score in the 50-over format. A 58-ball 87 from local boy Ajinkya Rahane and a 60 from out-of-form opener Shikhar Dhawan brought some cheer for the crowd but it was never going to be enough for the hosts, who folded up for 224 in 36 overs. Kagiso Rabada took four wickets while pace colleague Dale Steyn took three for the touring side to complete a 3-2 series win, their first in ODIs in India. De Kock (109) continued to make merry against the Indian bowlers, scoring his fifth century in nine innings after South Africa had lost Hashim Amla (23) early. The left-hander hit 17 fours and a six on his way to his eighth ODI hundred and laid the perfect platform for de Villiers's onslaught with a 154-run stand with du Plessis (133 retired hurt). India compounded their misery by dropping catches and du Plessis made the most of his good fortune to score his first century against India and his fifth overall after being put down twice, on 45 and 85. The right-handed batsman suffered severe cramps during the later part of his innings and had to retire. But by then he had already added 164 runs with de Villiers for the third wicket. De Villiers, the owner of the record for the fastest hundred in the format, needed no invitation to launch into the Indian bowlers with the stage set perfectly for his pyrotechnics. The 31-year-old reached his century, his 23rd in the format, in just 57 balls and cleared the boundary ropes with ease. The right-hander hit 11 sixes and three fours in his knock. India medium paceman Bhuvnehwar Kumar ended with figures of 1-106 in his 10 overs, the second most expensive in ODIs behind Australian Mick Lewis's 0-113 against South Africa in 2006. The two sides will now play a four-match Test series with the first match starting in Mohali on November 5. — Reuters Numbers Game 438/4\nIs the highest ODI score in India.
