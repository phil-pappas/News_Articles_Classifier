Some observations are more specific to a particular play, while others have more of a long-range viewpoint.\nChandler Jones, Dominique Easley and Rob Ninkovich were outstanding from a pressure standpoint. The Patriots dominated the situational aspects, whether it was Tom Brady being Tom Brady or the special teams units making big plays.\nSPECIAL ATTENTION\n1. Bill Belichick never flinched as the Colts committed one of the most spectacular special teams failures in history. When the Colts motioned nine players to the right, Belichick walked up the sideline, just behind the line of scrimmage, and stood there emotionless with his hands on his hips. On the field, Matthew Slater made the initial call to get everyone in line, and Nate Ebner and Brandon Bolden relayed some checks from there. Logan Ryan was also making some calls. Even though the Patriots had never seen that play before, they read their keys — which are based off a numbers system — to relay their assignments on the fly. It was a remarkable level of composure in a very chaotic environment, and it showed that being well-coached spreads far beyond X’s and O’s.\n2. The Patriots were actually ready for the Colts’ surprise onside kick in the second quarter. They kept their attention on the ball, and Ebner recognized the play as Pat McAfee approached it. Ebner, who was lined up in the middle of the field, immediately darted toward the sideline before McAfee even made contact. The Pats appeared to catch a break on the recovery, but credit a terrific kick from McAfee for that.\nUNDER PRESSURE\n3. Jones was particularly impressive after Jabaal Sheard left with a minor ankle injury — 2.5 sacks, two quarterback hits, two pressures, and he drew a holding penalty. Add it all up and Jones made eight plays as a pass rusher, which is a dominating number (and all but one pressure occurred after halftime). Jones’ had a three-play stretch in the fourth quarter against left tackle Anthony Castonzo with a sack, a drawn hold and a quarterback hit.\n4. Easley had his best game as a pro, with a half sack, three quarterback hits and two pressures. He beat a triple team for his third QB hit. Easley was the Patriots’ best defensive tackle the past two games against both the run and the pass. Alan Branch also contributed with a drawn holding penalty.\n5. Ninkovich drew an astounding three holding penalties, and added two quarterback hits and one pressure for his best game of the season. He is now tied with Sheard for the team lead with four drawn penalties in rushing responsibilities.\n6. To no one’s surprise, Jamie Collins made the most athletic play of the night by soaring over the Colts’ offensive line to block an extra point. He also had the Pats’ lone run stuff, blowing through the left guard to tackle Frank Gore for a loss of 4 yards. Collins is second to Sheard (four) with three run stuffs this season, and the 4-yard loss was the Pats’ most productive play of 2015 in that category.\n7. It wasn’t all great. Gore gained 23 yards in the first quarter when Sealver Siliga was blocked out of his gap, Jonathan Freeny couldn’t disengage from a block and Collins missed a tackle. Gore gained another 18 in the second quarter when the left guard blocked Malcom Brown so easily that the center peeled off to get to Collins, and Jerod Mayo couldn’t get off his block in time to make the tackle.\n8. Freeny had the nod in the nickel over Mayo, who typically entered the game when the Patriots used three-linebacker sets. Though Mayo’s playing time continues to rise, it’s the latest sign he isn’t entirely back from the torn patellar tendon, and it might be the case all season.\nLINE RECOVERY\n9. Marcus Cannon had a distinct limp after Brady’s sneak on the opening drive, but he remained on the field for the final seven plays of the series.\n10. Sebastian Vollmer and Cameron Fleming played well given the circumstances. Vollmer wasn’t decisively beat on any snap, though an illegal hands to the face penalty negated a Julian Edelman 19-yard catch in the second quarter.\n11. Credit Jonathan Newsome for a nice play on Brady’s first takedown — essentially a coverage sack. Newsome covered Dion Lewis in the left flat, peered back at Brady and realized Vollmer turned to the inside. He decided to head toward Brady to make the play. Fleming appeared to be responsible for Dwight Lowery’s fourth-quarter sack, the result of miscommunication. Lowery blitzed off the right side of the offensive line, where Rob Gronkowski went into a passing pattern and Fleming blocked in rather than kicking out. It was a good design by the Colts and a common offensive line mistake.\n12. On LeGarrette Blount’s 38-yard touchdown run, Fleming led the way by blocking two Colts. Shaq Mason, Josh Kline and Michael Williams also deserve credit for winning their blocks on the right side.\n13. Julian Edelman and Vollmer had the key blocks to pave the way for Danny Amendola’s 19-yard screen on third-and-17 in the second quarter. Nice way for Vollmer to respond after the penalty. David Andrews and Keshawn Martin also helped on the play.\nCONNECTION GAME\n14. Edelman’s 12-yard touchdown reception was a lesson in route-running mastery. He ran a crossing pattern with the Colts in a zone. Four players were responsible for him at various points in the play, but Edelman weaved his way through each of them to get open.\n15. Edelman’s drops have been an issue for the last two weeks, but the issue with his pinky — blown out of proportion on the telecast — is not new. He has had a funky finger for quite some time. Still, the three drops in a quick stretch between the first and second quarters, including one that led to a pick-six, have to be eliminated. Edelman did his part to make up for those miscues with a wild spin move on a fourth-and-2 sweep. Diagnosed perfectly by Erik Walden and D’Qwell Jackson, Edelman still spun past both in the backfield and ducked under a tackle for a 3-yard gain.\n16. Brady’s pocket awareness was astute as he created time to hit Blount for an 11-yard touchdown. The Colts ran over Tre’ Jackson and Fleming on the right side, but Brady evaded the rush as it spilled toward the inside. All the while, he recognized his first two options — Edelman and Gronkowski — were well covered, and he decided against throwing to Martin. Essentially, Brady went through three progressions, avoided the rush, shuffled his feet to buy time and then hit Blount for the decisive score in about 3 seconds.\n17. Edelman caught four passes for 30 yards outside the numbers, and two balls for 20 yards and a score over the middle. In terms of catches and yards, Edelman has been more productive outside the numbers in 3-of-5 games this season.\n18. Martin must be new or something. He got a little too close to attempt to celebrate with Gronkowski after the third-quarter touchdown, and had to jump backward to make sure he didn’t get pummeled by the Gronk spike.\n19. The Colts didn’t do anything to take away Gronkowski. For whatever reason, the ball just didn’t go his way. Brady had chances to hit Gronk, including a potential touchdown on the same play as the negated Scott Chandler score. There were plenty of instances when Brady just tried to unload the ball quicker than Gronk’s route allowed him to get open, too. But really, there were a lot of single coverages with a handful of double teams mixed into it.\nCOVERAGE STATS\n20. Here’s how Andrew Luck fared while targeting each secondary player: Malcolm Butler (6-of-12, 81 yards, touchdown, three pass breakups), Logan Ryan (6-of-10, 71 yards, TD, PBU), Devin McCourty (5-of-8, 56 yards, TD, defensive pass interference penalty), Patrick Chung (1-of-1, 8 yards), Jamie Collins (2-of-4, 21 yards, PBU, Jonathan Freeny (3-of-3, 21 yards), Duron Harmon (0-of-1, PBU) and Justin Coleman (1-of-2, 27 yards).\n21. Butler opened the game against T.Y. Hilton, but spent the majority of the night on Donte Moncrief, who caught 5-of-8 targets against Butler for 64 yards and one score. (One of the surrendered completions went for 9 yards on third-and-10, so that wasn’t a bad play.) Butler finished strong by forcing four incompletions, including two pass breakups, on his final five targets. He leads the Pats with six pass breakups, and his three against the Colts were a season high for the team.\n22. Ryan spent most of his time on Andre Johnson, who caught 3-of-6 targets against him for 35 yards. Ryan’s pass breakup came against Johnson. Hilton beat Ryan twice for 23 yards and a score.\n23. Chung landed Hilton for a good portion of the game and almost exclusively in the second half, but Luck never targeted the matchup. Though the Pats spent most of the night in a nickel package, it was the less traditional set that included two cornerbacks and three safeties (McCourty, Chung, Harmon), which has become the norm for the Pats. McCourty and Chung spent most of the game closer to the line of scrimmage in man-coverage roles.\n24. McCourty’s numbers weren’t great, but he was asked to do more than any player on defense. He covered receivers Hilton, Philip Dorsett and Griff Whalen along with tight ends Coby Fleener and Dwayne Allen. McCourty stopped Hilton for a 10-yard reception on third-and-12, and the touchdown happened on the final defensive snap of the night. (Luck and Whalen hooked up for an impressive 18-yard score despite pretty good coverage.)\n25. The Colts’ first two third-down conversions came on throws against Freeny, who was picked at the line and gave up 11 yards to Frank Gore and 2 yards to Jack Doyle on third-and-1. The Patriots found a way to clean that up after the opening series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:28:31.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
