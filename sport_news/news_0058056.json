The Irvington resident is considering taking an official visit to Arizona State as well. \nWalker remains committed to Ohio State, the school he Tweeted he’d attend during halftime of the Buckeyes’ national championship victory over Oregon on Jan. 12. He is exploring his options in accordance with NCAA guidelines, though, because Walker can’t sign a binding national letter of intent until Feb. 3. \nWalker, who could not be reached for comment today, flew to Michigan this morning along with DePaul teammate Quayshon Alexander, a senior defensive end from Haledon who committed to Nebraska in June. They’re attending the Northwestern-Michigan game today in Ann Arbor as part of their official visits. \nThe 6-foot-1, 210-pound Walker is rated the No. 1 senior running back in the country by ESPN.com and Rivals.com. \nRivals ranks Walker as the No. 21 senior prospect overall, regardless of position. ESPN.com ranks him No. 22 overall. \nWalker has rushed for 606 yards and five touchdowns on 94 carries in five games this season for DePaul (1-4), ranked No. 5 in The Record Non-Public Top 6. Walker sat out most of the first quarter of a nationally televised, 15-13 loss to Bergen Catholic on Friday night for undisclosed reasons. But he rushed for 146 yards, including a 5-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter, on 23 carries. \nEmail: idec@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:22:45.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
