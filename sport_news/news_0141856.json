(Photo: Adrian Szkolar/The Journal News) \nOSSINING â€“ Since head coach Francesco Notaristefano took over New Rochelle three years ago, one of the big goals the team had was to get a win in sectionals. \nOn Saturday, the Lady Huguenots accomplished just that, defeating seventh-seeded Ossining 2-0 in a Class AA first-round game at Ossining High School. \nFor a program with little history in terms of winning, the feeling after was pure joy, a very emotion from a year ago. \n\"Last year at this time, we were crying because we were out,\" New Rochelle's Sabrina Salov said. \"We deserved the win. It was a long time coming.\" \nNew Rochelle, a team that struggled to finish during the regular season, opened the scoring in the 13th minute when Salov finished off a rebound from a Sydney Jasper shot. \nJasper scored early in the second half to give New Rochelle some a cushion, and the New Rochelle defense, led by freshman sweeper Michaela Canapa, prevented Ossining, which got only limited minutes from injured leading goal-scorer Jhada Francis, from creating any solid chances the rest of the way. \n\"I think our nerves kind of got us at the beginning of the game, and we didn't get enough shots on their goalie,\" Ossining head coach Stephanie Leveille said. \"Give it to New Rochelle. They definitely wanted this game, they were hungry and played with a lot of passion.\" \nNew Rochelle will take on second-seeded Scarsdale, who squeaked by Carmel 1-0 in overtime in its first round game, in the quarterfinals on Tuesday. New Rochelle was ousted in sectionals by the Raiders last season. \n\"We're looking for revenge,\" Jasper said.
