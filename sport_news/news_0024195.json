Whether due to a recent string of injuries or lack of productivity, these select few enter each new season with something to prove.\nThe five players on this list are the latest examples of this dilemma. At one point, each of them either became or had the potential to become NBA superstars, but tragic circumstances put their careers in limbo. The good news is they are still young enough to climb back up the NBA ladder. The bad news is their recent track record makes it difficult to put too much faith in a turnaround.\nAs the 2015-16 regular season rapidly approaches, will these players regain the form that once made them relevant or will their fall from grace continue?\n1. Deron Williams, Point Guard, Dallas Mavericks © FanDuel Insider Dallas Mavericks guard Deron Williams poses for a photo during NBA basketball media day Monday, Sept. 28, 2015, in Dallas. (AP Photo/LM Otero) Once upon a time, there was a genuine debate over who was the best point guard in basketball: Chris Paul or Deron Williams? Fast-forward to 2015. Paul is still one of the best, if not the best, floor general in basketball and has the Los Angeles Clippers firmly in the NBA championship mix. Meanwhile, Williams is hoping to rejuvenate his career by returning home to Texas with the Dallas Mavericks, his third team in six years.\n“I want to prove myself wrong because I started to doubt myself in the past,” Williams said, per Dwain Price of the Fort Worth Star Telegram. “I’ve got to get out of that rut I was in the last couple of years mentally, and I look forward to this situation. I think it’s going to be better for me.”\nThere are plenty of reasons to be pessimistic about D-Will’s chances of turning things around. He’s played at least 70 games just twice in the last six years, while his scoring average has dropped in each of the last three seasons. As a testament to just how far Williams has fallen, ESPN placed him No. 114 in the 2015 edition of its yearly player rankings, which is down 59 spots from last season. Williams also has a history of butting heads with coaches, from Jerry Sloan in Utah to Jason Kidd and Lionel Hollins in Brooklyn.\nOn the bright side, Williams is still only 31 and just four years removed from an All-Star caliber season that saw him average 21 points and 8.7 assists. With Wesley Matthews (Achilles) and Chandler Parsons (knee) sidelined, he should have an increased offensive role as the No. 2 option behind Dirk Nowitzki while operating under lower expectations than in his last two stops.\nWilliams will never find himself in the “point god” discussion with Paul again, but if he can avoid the pitfalls that have hindered him in the past, there’s a chance he can still salvage his once-promising career.\n2.

Gordon lost a tooth on the collision with the floor. Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports Back in December of 2011, Eric Gordon was seen as the crown jewel in the package the then-New Orleans Hornets received from the Los Angeles Clippers for Chris Paul. Four years later, things haven’t gone quite as the now-Pelicans had planned. Gordon initially ruffled some feathers among the NOLA faithful when he publicly stated his heart was in Phoenix after the Suns offered him a four-year, $58 million deal, which New Orleans eventually matched.\n“After visiting the Suns, the impression the organization made on me is incredible,” Gordon said in July of 2012. “Mr. (Robert) Sarver, Lon Babby, Lance Blanks, the front office staff and coach (Alvin) Gentry run a first-class organization, and I strongly feel they are the right franchise for me. Phoenix is where my heart is right now.”\nMaking matters worse, injuries have led Gordon to appear in just 176 games during his four years in the Big Easy. Face of the franchise honors now belong to Anthony Davis, while Tyreke Evans usurped Gordon as the club’s top guard.\nGordon has since repented for his Phoenix comments and now finds himself in the situation he initially dreamed of. This season, Gordon, his heart and former Suns coach Alvin Gentry are all in New Orleans together. At just 26 years old, Gordon will be entering his contract year playing in an offensive system that made household names out of guys like Joe Johnson and Klay Thompson. Gordon can easily become the next productive scorer in Gentry’s scheme. He’s a career 38.3 percent shooter from behind the arc and has no fear using his 215-pound frame to be a human battering ram when attacking the basket.\nThe key will be avoiding the injuries that have plagued him his entire career. With an opportunity to play for the coach he once pined for and potentially land a lucrative deal next summer when the salary cap is expected to spike, the stakes have never been higher for Gordon. He will either become the star the franchise hoped he would be or fade into obscurity.\n3. Anthony Bennett, Power Forward, Toronto Raptors © Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY Sport Feb 21, 2014; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Cleveland Cavaliers forward Anthony Bennett (15) looks on against the Toronto Raptors at Air Canada Centre. The Raptors beat the Cavaliers 98-91. Mandatory Credit: Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY Sports Anthony Bennett’s third season in the NBA should be set to the tune of Eminem’s “Lose Yourself”. After bombing out with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Minnesota Timberwolves in the last two seasons, the former No. 1 overall pick now has one shot and one opportunity to seize everything he ever wanted. Like Marshall Mathers (or, more specifically, Mathers’ character in “8 Mile”, B-Rabbit), Bennett will be looking to ignite his career in his hometown. After being waived by Minnesota earlier this summer, Bennett signed a one-year deal to return to Canada and play for the Toronto Raptors, a team who could use help at the power forward position after losing Amir Johnson in free agency.\nBennett still has a long way to go before he cracks the Raptors’ rotation, currently behind proven veterans Patrick Patterson and Luis Scola on the depth chart. For Bennett to make the climb, he’ll need to prove he’s not the oft-injured, unproductive player that floundered during his first two seasons. Bennett averaged just 4.2 points and three rebounds in 52 games as a rookie with the Cavs. He followed that up by contributing 5.2 points and 3.8 rebounds in 57 games with the T’Wolves.\nTo put those numbers in perspective, fellow draft bust Kwame Brown averaged 4.5 points and 3.5 boards as a rookie before improving to 7.4 points and 5.3 rebounds in his second season. Bennett also possesses a career player efficiency rating (PER) of 9.5, which is lower than first-round flops such as Hasheem Thabeet (10.3), Darko Milicic (12.3), Brown (12.5), Eddy Curry (15.9) and Stromile Swift (16.1).\nThe good news is the 22-year-old is showing some signs of life in the preseason with his new team. He’s averaging nine points and five boards through two games. He also turned some heads by putting Lakers big man Robert Upshaw on a poster with a sick one-handed jam. Earlier in the summer, Bennett’s trainer Drew Hanlen posted a video on Instagram of the former UNLV standout, claiming the forward lost 12 pounds and was poised for a big year.\nAs he gets set to suit up for his third team in as many years, this is likely Bennett’s last chance to prove himself in the pros. If the combination of being dismissed early by two different teams and playing in front of his hometown crowd isn’t enough to motivate Bennett, then what will?\n4. Anderson Varejao, Power Forward/Center, Cleveland Cavaliers © AP Images Anderson Varejao Anderson Varejao rose to glory as a high-energy big man with a knack for cleaning up on the boards. He was in the midst of a breakout year in 2012-13, averaging 14.1 and 14.4 rebounds in 25 games before missing the rest of the season with a blood clot in his lung. Sadly, injuries have been as much a part of Varejao’s career as his prowess on the interior. He’s never played a full season during his 11-year career and has played in just 172 games since 2009-10. Last season, he missed all but 26 games after tearing his Achilles shortly before Christmas.\nA year later, the Cleveland Cavaliers’ frontcourt landscape has changed. Russian rim-protector Timofey Mozgov was acquired from the Denver Nuggets shortly after Varejao went down. Tristan Thompson emerged as the frenetic rebounding force off the bench that Varejao used to be, while Kevin Love is now entrenched as the Cavs’ premier big man after signing a five-year, $110 million contract during the offseason.\nMeanwhile, Varejao finds himself having to deal with both recovery from Achilles surgery and trying to carve his niche in a crowded field. Still, there are reasons for optimism. He’s been a “full go” at training camp and made his triumphant return to the court on Oct. 4. With Love (shoulder) and Mozgov (knee) also coming off offseason surgeries in addition to Thompson being in the midst of a contract holdout, Varejao could play his way into an increased role in the Cavs’ rotation, if he can stay healthy.\nAt 33 years old with a lot of wear and tear on his body, the odds of Varejao once again becoming a double-double machine are slim, but there’s still an opportunity to make the most out of the twilight of his career.\n5. Derrick Rose, Point Guard, Chicago Bulls © AP Images Derrick Rose A lot has changed since Derrick Rose’s magical 2010-11 MVP season. Including the playoffs, he’s played in just 113 games since his breakout year due to a litany of injuries. He’s been embroiled in some off-the-court drama , while having his work ethic on the court allegedly questioned by teammate Jimmy Butler. Rose also garnered some criticism for admitting he’s been thinking about free agency …which he doesn’t hit until the summer of 2017.\nAs if that isn’t enough, Rose’s 2015-16 campaign didn’t even get off the ground before the point guard suffered his first injury of the season. The 27-year-old suffered a left orbital fracture after inadvertently taking an elbow to the face from a teammate during practice. Rose’s durability, or lack thereof, combined with rise of other floor generals such as Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook have caused the former No. 1 overall pick to drop down the point guard ranks.\nTo his credit, Rose has been solid when he suits up, averaging 19.1 points and six assists in the 100 regular season games he’s played since his MVP season. Still, that’s a small sample size and Rose’s inability to stay healthy makes it justified to wonder how long he’ll remain among the elite.\nThe good news is Rose is only expected to miss two weeks with his latest injury and the Bulls remain hopeful he’ll be ready for the team’s Oct. 27 opener against Cleveland. The bad news is we’ve seen this movie before with Rose. Basketball fans anxiously awaited Rose’s return to the court last season and were woefully disappointed when he could only play 51 games. Rose has the talent to once again be in the MVP discussion, but at some point, the constant broken bones and ligament tears are going to take its toll.\nThe post Starting Five: NBA Players Entering 2015-16 At Career Crossroads appeared first on FanDuel Insider .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/1018875/according-source-jimmy-butler-hasnt-thrilled-derrick-roses-work-ethic", "http://basketball.realgm.com/player/Anthony-Bennett/Summary/24660", "http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?section=magazine&id=3659206", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider", "https://instagram.com/p/3CoGP6lNo0/?taken-by=drewhanlen", "http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13779669/chicago-bulls-star-derrick-rose-undergoes-surgery-left-orbital-fracture", "http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rosede01.html", "http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13814026/nba-nbarank-111-120", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider/2015/10/16/starting-five-nba-players-entering-2015-16-at-career-crossroads/", "http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8128612/2012-nba-free-agency-eric-gordon-phoenix-suns-agree-max-salary-deal", "http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25320758/bulls-derrick-rose-is-already-looking-toward-his-2017-free-agency", "http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nba/dallas-mavericks/article37663044.html", "http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&sum=1&p1=bennean01&p2=brownkw01&p3=curryed01&p4=milicda01&p5=swiftst01&p6=thabeha01", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/ct-derrick-rose-lawsuit-20150827-story.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApUNrOeC1g0", "http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gordoer01.html"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:45:43.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
