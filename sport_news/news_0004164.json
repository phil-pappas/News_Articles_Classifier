Kevin Jairaj / USA TODAY Sports Oct 26, 2015 at 9:48a ET 0Shares \nAfter falling behind early thanks to three consecutive turnovers, the Buffalo Bills battled back against the Jacksonville Jaguars to mount a wild comeback. Unfortunately, Blake Bortles' late-game heroics put an end to the Bills' comeback attempt as the Jaguars escaped 34-31 in London. \nA key play in the game came late in the fourth prior to Bortles' game-winning touchdown pass to Allen Hurns. On a pivotal third-and-15, Bills cornerback Nickell Robey was called for pass interference, giving the Jaguars a first down. Two plays later, Bortles tossed the game-winner to Hurns and the rest is history. \nNeedless to say, Robey wasn't happy with the call and proceeded to rip it after the game. \n\"The worst call I’ve ever been a part of in my life,\" Robey said via Tyler Dunne of the Buffalo News . \"It was just a terrible call. I’m still here waiting for an answer: What did I do?\" \nRobey continued to say he's not alone in thinking it was a bad call. His teammates also don't believe it was warranted. \n\"I really feel like it was a terrible call. My teammates feel the same. They can vouch for me and so can my coaches,\" Robey continued. \"One thing I know here right now, we’re still together here trying to put the puzzle together and come away with all these wins but sometimes I feel like calls are questionable. And the call today was terrible. I don’t see where the contact was made, where any of that was made.\" \nIt was a gut-wrenching loss for the Bills who have now fallen to 3-4 and are sitting in the basement of the AFC East. Fortunately, they're heading into their bye week and hope to get healthy. They've struggled to get their starting offense on the field together, with LeSean McCoy , Sammy Watkins , Percy Harvin , and Tyrod Taylor all missing time. Rex Ryan is more than ready for a week off. \n\"I'll be honest with you, I don't know if I've ever been on a team that needs a bye worse than we do,\" Ryan said via Dan Wetzel of Yahoo Sports . \"We've got to get some guys back. And not just average football players, some good ones … and then have a go at it. Nine games.\" MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
