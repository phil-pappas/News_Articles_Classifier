I've taken the initiative first. So the quality of my first shots has been better this year than I think ever before.\" \nNo one who watched his dismantling of an admittedly below-par Andy Murray in the semi-finals in Shanghai would disagree. Whatever tactics the Scot tried, Djokovic simply turned the rally to his advantage. \nWhen Stefan celebrates his second birthday next October, might Djokovic be celebrating an even better season? Don't bet against it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:12:21.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
