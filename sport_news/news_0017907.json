He wouldn't have had a chance to fly any family in for his debut, as Methot participated in the morning skate and coach Dave Cameron announced there would be no changes to the lineup. \n\"If you're not prepared you're going to get caught, and that's not a good thing,\" Wideman, who was paired with Jared Cowen, said when status quo was still in effect. \"So just try to stay prepared and be ready for anything.\" \nWideman's contract calls for him to make $600,000 in the NHL, $400,000 in the AHL. But nobody wants to just practice, right? The games are the fun part. \n\"As an athlete you always want to play,\" said Wideman. \"This is obviously every kid's dream, to play in the NHL. Right now I'm here and I'm learning a lot in practice and watching games. This is where I want to be, I'm just pushing every day to get in the lineup. When I do, I've got to play well.\" \nIn Wideman's case, that means showing he can get the job done defensively. Everyone knows of his offensive talents. \nIn the first two periods against Nashville, Wideman played 12 shifts over 8:39 of ice time. He had no points or shots on goal, but he was also a plus-1. So far, so good. \nSTARTS AND STOPS \nWearing an orange 'Dan McCarthy, NDP' (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke) button Saturday morning was Predators coach Peter Laviolette. \"I think it's Kevin's brother,\" he said coyly, referring to his assistant coach, Kevin McCarthy. \"But it's just time for a change.\" Give him credit for knowing the slogans, but as an American, Laviolette obviously won't be voting in the upcoming federal election: \"It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"I'm a proud supporter of Dan McCarthy.\" ... Mark Stone's goal 15 seconds into the second ended the Senators goal-less streak at 84 minutes and 20 seconds. We point this out only because last season, Ottawa was the only NHL team that didn't go a game without a goal ... Thought of what Craig Anderson said Saturday morning after Mike Hoffman's goal in the second period. \"There's a lot of times where it looks like an innocent shot,\" stated Anderson, \"and there could be traffic or a deflection, where it's a play that looks really easy and it may not be.\" From our angle, it looked like Hutton should have made the save, but Hoffman's blast went off Ryan Ellis' stick. \nBETWEEN PERIODS \nYou saw him grow up, from a teenager through 11 seasons as a Senator, and now Mike Fisher is 49 games from the 1,000th of his NHL career. \"With my track record I may never get there,\" Fisher joked Saturday morning, referring to all the injuries he has suffered playing a robust style. \"You used to get the old leather jacket after 400 from the PA. It was like, oh man I made it! Full pension! Now all of a sudden it's like holy crap, almost 1,000. It's hard to believe it's close.\" ... Isaiah Michael Fisher, the first child of Mike and his wife Carrie Underwood, is now seven and a half months old. When is No. 2 coming? With their busy schedules, it's anyone's guess. \"It's hard to get her pregnant on face time,\" Fisher laughed ... Fisher didn't hesitate when the Predators offered him a two-year extension worth $8.8 million last June. \"With the direction the team is going, how I felt, also being able to play in Nashville ... that was a good scenario for me,\" said the 35-year old. \"I just felt I'd play a few more years, and then we'll see. Alfie made it to 40, I should at least make it to 37.\" ... Anderson was asked how a goalie prepares to face a Shea Weber shot. \"Extra gear,\" he quipped after the morning skate. \"He shoots hard. He's got me a couple of times up high. It hurts, it stings, but you expect it, you know it's coming. You kind of thrive on those moments where you've got the opportunity to stop a guy that shoots well up into the triple digits.\" ... Curtis Lazar, who was robbed by Carter Hutton on back to back chances in the final five seconds of the first period, had the pleasure of blocking a Weber shot while killing a penalty in the second. \"Me and Page have already talked about it,\" he said in the morning, with \"Page\" being Jean-Gabriel Pageau. \"If you see me push Page, it's like 'this one's yours buddy.' ... Lazar and Weber are pals who skate together in Kelowna during the summer along with Milan Lucic, Brayden and Luke Schenn, Scott Hartnell, Blake Comeau, Cody Fransen, Josh Gorges, Tyler Myers, James Reimer, Carey Price, Devin Dubynk, Vernon Fidler and \"the list goes on,\" said Lazar. \"That's good skates.\" \nTHINGS I THINK I THUNK \nIn his first 6:45 as Erik Karlsson's partner on the first pairing, Mark Borowiecki had two hits (including a bone rattler on Craig Smith in front of the Preds bench) and his third fight in three games. Thankfully, some things never change ... Zack Smith fought for the first time this season, objecting to a Barrett Jackman hit that could have been an interference penalty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:38:08.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
