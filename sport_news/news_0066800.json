One originates from Nigeria and has spent time in England and Canada. Another comes from Texas and the fourth is from Michigan. \nWill “Turtle” Jackson, Derek Ogbeide, E’Torrion Wilridge and Michael Edwards make up a unique class that offers a wide range of talents. \nJackson is the point guard of the future, who prefers to pass first. Ogbeide is the rare low post player who appears physically capable of playing right away. Wilridge is the wing player with great athleticism that Georgia lacked last season. And Edwards a legitimate 6-foot-10 forward who prefers to play like a guard. \nThey all offer improved flexibility for this season’s team while also providing long-term upside and stability for the Georgia basketball program as a whole. \nJackson is a local kid, and the most well known for his work at nearby Athens Christian. He was a four-star recruit who originally committed to play at Connecticut. A desire to stay closer to his family and home is kept in Athens. \nHe has a confidence that radiates. He calls himself a better shooting Rajon Rondo. \n“He’s not quite. A lot of people think he is because of his nickname,” Kenny Gaines said. “He’s a worker. He tries to be first in every drill. He does have a sense of confidence in him.” \nWith Gaines, Charles Mann and J.J. Frazier all returning, Jackson has the most congested path to playing time. When head coach Mark Fox talks about Jackson he doesn’t really talk about the present. \n“What excites me about Turtle is all of his talent,” Fox said. “For him to stay home is obviously important to us and we are excited about the career he could have.” \nThere's little mystery about Ogbeide as a basketball player. A bulldozer listed as 6-foot-8 and 250 pounds, he is easily the most physically imposing player on the team. \nOgbeide’s favorite two NBA players are Demarcus Cousins and Hakeem Olajuwon, who is also from Nigeria. \nWhat makes Ogbeide standout are the things that aren’t as obvious. Coaches and teammate praise his touch around the basket and his maturity off the court. The maturity comes from spending time in Nigeria, London, Sweden, Maryland, and Canada all before attending two years of high school in Atlanta. \n“Going to college is always a challenge in it’s own. I wasn’t in for as big a shock because I’ve transitioned before,” Ogbeide said. \nOgbeide didn’t mention any individual goal or skill he wanted to improve on. He says all he wants is a better team, whatever it takes. \nWilridge is the great unknown of the Georgia basketball team. He has good length and great athleticism. Other than Kenny Paul Geno, Wilridge is the only prototypical small forward on the team. And with the modern trend of playing small, Wilridge has embraced the idea of playing as a small-ball power forward. \nWilridge also has a good bit of uncertainty about himself. He admits he needs to improve on defense. He says he needs to adjust to better handle physical players. He said he struggles playing against Charles Mann in practice. \n“Personally my expectations aren’t too high,” Wilridge said. “I know I have a lot to learn and hopefully I can find some minutes later on this season.” \nLastly there is Edwards, who was the last player of the four to commit to the Bulldogs. While Ogbeide is more of a bull, Edwards is more of a gazelle. A player who likes to glide up and down the court and use his athleticism instead of his brute strength. \nEdwards isn’t the rebounder Ogbeide is, that was the one area Edwards said he wanted to improve on the most, but he can provide a nice compliment to Ogbeide when on the floor. \n“I think the advantage Mike and Derek have is that they are both specimens,” Fox said. “They are physical, they are strong, they can run.” \nWhile Ogbeide’s player comps are obvious, Edwards are a little more out of the blue. He grew up idealizing Michael Jordan, and said he likes to model his game after a mix of Blake Griffin and Kevin Durant. \nAt the bare minimum, the four freshmen provide depth to a team that didn't have much of it last year. But there is real talent in this class and that could be evident in their first game and continue to grow through throughout the season. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:29:59.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
