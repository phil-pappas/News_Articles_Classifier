He repeatedly said it, through stretches of being a healthy scratch and then being reassigned to the minors. He proved his point – possibly for good – when he tallied three points against the New York Rangers in the Washington Capitals’ second-round playoff series, cementing his place with the team’s young stars. \nThe 20-year-old won’t be leaving the lineup anytime soon, but it’s now about where he is in the lineup. Burakovsky started the season as the team’s second-line center, a sort of placeholder until Nicklas Backstrom returned after offseason hip surgery . Backstrom made his season debut as the second-line center on Saturday night against Carolina, a 4-1 Capitals win , but his return has made for a crowded top-six forward corps. \nBurakovsky became the odd man out. Because Coach Barry Trotz didn’t want to break up a third line that has been arguably the team’s most consistent, he put Burakovsky at fourth-line wing. While Burakovsky is happy to be back at his more natural position, he won’t get as many minutes on the fourth line, though Trotz said he plans to move Burakovsky around in the lineup during games as a way to inject offense into a line or relieve another player. \n“Bert’s pretty good offensively,” Trotz said. “He could move up a little bit, but he’s going to be a little bit of a swing guy probably for a little bit here. When I’m looking for a little more speed or offense, I’ll probably be throwing him up.” \nBurakovsky ranked behind only Backstrom and Alex Ovechkin in even-strength points per 60 minutes and even-strength scoring chance percentage on the Capitals last season, and he finished first with a 54.6 percent even-strength shot attempt rate. He had nine goals and 13 assists in 53 games. \nStarting the season at center, Burakovsky said he felt like his legs were slow. He found himself thinking too much during the game, always worried about being in the right position. In his first game back at wing, he said it instantly felt more natural. Trotz said Burakovsky will get some some shifts with the top two lines because he wants to manage the minutes of players like T.J. Oshie, who play on both the power play and the penalty kill. \nBurakovsky now wants to show he belongs there on a more permanent basis. \n“That’s something I’m trying to fight for every day, to get up in the lines a little bit here,” Burakovsky said. “Obviously, now it’s fun to have [center Chandler Stephenson] on my line, the two youngest guys on the team playing together, so that’s kind of fun. But obviously, I want to get up in the lines here and play with the top-six guys here.” Isabelle Khurshudyan covers the Washington Capitals.
