Nearly 20 years ago, the most innocent victim of the riots that were gripping Los Angeles had yet to be born — she was shot while still in her mother's womb.\nHer mother survived — and miraculously, so did she, with a small scar on her elbow as the only physical evidence of the shooting.\nOn April 30, 1992 — while swarms of looters, police and rioters raged through her Compton block — 71/2 month-pregnant Elvira Evers felt a bullet pierce her skin.\n“I remember everything like it was yesterday,” Evers told NBC Los Angeles.\nAt the time, looters and fires ravaged the city. The riots were sparked by the acquittal of four cops accused of the brutal beating of Rodney King , which was caught on tape. The case of King, an African-American, fueled racial tension that then spiraled into violence and homicides. Fifty-four people were killed.\nA friend rushed Evers to St. Francis Medical Center, where doctors performed an emergency Caesarean section.\nOlga Shalygin/AP Jessica Evans (r.) turns 20 on April 30, two decades after she was shot while in her mother's womb, during the 1992 riots. Evers slept for a week.\nWhen she came to, she assumed her baby hadn’t made it. But then a nurse brought her Jessica, whose elbow had been hit by the 9-mm. bullet.\n“I saw the baby and I touched her and I cried and I cried,” Evers told NBC Los Angeles.\nA 1992 report by The Associated Press detailed Evers’ shock when she left the hospital and returned home to Compton.\n“Everything was different to me,” she told The AP. “All the stores around there were burned. It’s just like I was brand-new going to that place.”\nRhonda Birndorf/AP Jessica Evans (r.) turns 20 on April 30, two decades after she was shot while in her mother's womb, during the 1992 riots. She reportedly told a friend, “I know I deserve better than this,” then moved to nearby Gardena.\nNow, days before her 20th birthday, Jessica Evers tries to understand how she survived, and why.\n“As each day goes by, I try to find out what I’m here for,” she told NBC Los Angeles.\n“I’m innocent, but then again there are other innocent people that got hurt, too,” she added.\nAlthough the riots’ 20th anniversary is just around the corner, Evers says she’s forced to remember them every year on Jessica’s birthday.\n“I get sad,” she told NBC Los Angeles. “Because 20 years ago, I was supposed to be dead. So I have God to give thanks.”\nrmurray@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:18:38.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
