Perseverance was the key and the winners exemplified the concept. In the boys’ meet, the Blue Devils had five of the seven fastest runners to defeat the Hawks and Chargers. South Lenoir’s Ricardo Crespo ran the fastest time at 19:52, 41 seconds ahead of teammate Miguel Venegas and 53 seconds faster than North Lenoir’s Nick Brown. “Our guys have been working since the beginning of the year on pack running,” Dodd said. “It’s been one of our keys to the season and has become our motto — it’s important to have a good pack than to just have one frontrunner.” Crespo said he was tiring during the last third of the race, but kept pushing for the victory. “I was having trouble during that last mile,” Crespo said. “Other courses we’ve run don’t have as many hills. What I did like was the forest because of the atmosphere and there wasn’t as much sun.” In the girls’ race, Ayden-Grifton’s Halei Ward finished the race in 22:53, 1:32 faster than Faith Stainback — who is homeschooled — and 3:20 over North Lenoir’s Lainey Nix. “I was just trying to take it one runner at a time and try to knock them off,” Ward said. “It’s a pretty hard course to run compared to some of the other ones we’ve done this season.” Since Ayden-Grifton didn’t have enough runners to qualify, North Lenoir defeated South Lenoir 26 to 30. Lady Hawks coach Alexis Tardalo said she was excited about the efforts of her team, especially with practices being called off due to inclement weather and the level of competition. “South Lenoir is a very good team and they train very hard,” Tardalo said. “I was worried because practices have been washed out and it can be hard to maintain the level of training we’ve done. If you’re not constantly running, it can be easy to slide some in a couple of days, so I was proud of our efforts.” Junious Smith III can be reached at 252-559-1078 and Junious.Smith@Kinston.com .
