The same energy, I didn't get from them as the last two weeks,\" when the Bulldogs fell 28-27 at Heritage Christian and beat Knightstown 45-17. \nAll four of the Royals' scores were accounted for by quarterback Jarett Lewis, two throwing and two running. \nLewis found Austin Smith for 64 yards in the opening period and Clayton Brumfield for 28 with 14 seconds left in the first half, and scored from 12 and 6 yards out in the final quarter. \nLewis was 9-for-14 for 183 yards, and Devin Denny rushed 21 times for 149 yards for EH. \nLapel possessed the ball nine times and punted four times, had two passes intercepted, gave up the ball on downs twice and the other time was the end of the first half. \nOther than Jones, who carried 28 times, Lapel netted 1 yard on the ground and 15 passing. Levi Frazier was 2-for-12. \nStill, Lapel hung with EH (9-0) for three quarters and had a chance to cut into the Royals' 12-0 halftime advantage. \nOn the first play from scrimmage in the second half, Jones busted one for 44 yards to EH's 46-yard line. Jones picked up two more first downs and, after a Lapel penalty, ran three times for 11 yards to set up fourth-and-4 at the Royals' 11. \nFrazier threw for Braxton Kemerly in the corner of the end zone, but it was too long and the Bulldogs came up empty on their best chance of the night. \nLapel recovered two EH fumbles, one on the Bulldogs' 13 on the Royals' first possession and the other by John Sherwood at the EH 17 in the third period. \n\"I thought our defense played really well, and offensively we shot ourselves in the foot,\" Miller said. \"We've got to get it corrected, and we'll do that. I don't think we coached our best game.\" \nSectional week will now be at hand for the Bulldogs, who last year returned to the regional round. They get a Scecina club they believe they can beat, unlike in recent years when the schools met as members of the Indiana Crossroads Conference (Lapel has since left the ICC). \n\"They're not the same team they were in 2011 and 2012, when they made two state championship appearances, but they're always going to be good,\" Miller said. \"I think we've proven in 1A and 2A that we can play with about anybody when we're playing well. So I think if we come out and play well, it's going to be a really good game.\" \nEH, the 2013 1A state runner-up, opens Sectional 40 play at home against Northeastern, whom it beat in a sectional title game a year ago.
