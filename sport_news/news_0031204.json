Nick Saban, in nine seasons at Alabama, has posted a 90-18 record, with a 51-12 mark in-conference. As such, fans have gotten accustomed to winning – and assuming that the Crimson Tide is the best team in the SEC. Thursday night, Saban, during his weekly radio show, told Alabama fans not to get “arrogant” until his team beats everyone else on the field.\nAdChoices Via Alex Byington of TimesDaily.com:\nSaban to fans: \"Get it out of your mind that anybody we play in the SEC is not going to be a tough game. … Don't have an arrogant attitude.\"\n— Alex Byington (@abyingtonTD) October 9, 2015\nSaban to fans: \"Don't have an arrogant attitude that we're better than anybody else. We're not. Until we beat them on the field, we're not.\"\n— Alex Byington (@abyingtonTD) October 9, 2015\nSaban has never been one to get ahead of himself, so his warning doesn’t come as a surprise.\nAlabama still has some very tough games on its slate, including matchups with No. 9 Texas A&M and No. 7 LSU. If they somehow survive and win the league, it may be Saban’s most impressive accomplishment yet.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/abyingtonTD/status/652287423901253632", "https://twitter.com/abyingtonTD/status/652287623189397504", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.timesdaily.com/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:58:47.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
