Zimmerman is receiving plenty of preseason hype, and the 7-footer from Bishop Gorman High probably deserves it. A few days after being voted the Mountain West's Preseason Freshman of the Year, Zimmerman was named to the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award watch list, which was announced by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nThis is an obscure award just in its second year of existence, but it's named in honor of a three-time NCAA champion so it means something. The Abdul-Jabbar award recognizes the top centers in college basketball.\nZimmerman is listed as a forward on the Rebels' roster, and the sky hook is not part of his offensive arsenal, but those are irrelevant details because he will play some center this season.\nThe watch list has 20 candidates. Zimmerman is the only Mountain West big man to make the list.\nContact reporter Matt Youmans at myoumans@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2907 .
