Six goals against in two games doesn't give you much chance of getting points. \n\"Our approach wasn't good enough. \n\"They dominated midfield and we didn't work hard enough to close them down, to get around them, particularly from the front. \n\"There wasn't really an element of our game that we necessarily got right.\" \nThe defeat, Wolves' second at Molineux this season, leaves them firmly in mid table, 12th in the division, six points off the play-offs and five from the relegation zone. \nJackett revealed he gave his players a half time dressing down, but was left frustrated at the lack of a reaction in the second half. \nHe added: \"There certainly were (some harsh words). \n\"We needed to change, the pattern at the second half started pretty much exactly the same. \n\"We changed system, a couple of people, and had a little bit of an initial reaction. \n\"Then after that the game petered out and we've conceded a poor goal on the counter attack. \n\"We didn't impose ourselves on them, there was a lot spell between us being 1-0 down and the second goal, but we didn't do enough in that period and only really created one good chance. \n\"Other than that we didn't create enough. Defensively Brentford handled us well.\" \nOf the boos at half and full time, Jackett said: \"It is fair enough. The fans encouraged us tonight, they stuck with it, I'm thankful for that. Their reaction is justified with that performance and that result. \n\"Their passing was sharper. I didn't think we were closing down well enough. \n\"Brentford set off at a good tempo, played very well, passed the ball very well, and we didn't get to their tempo. \n\"Middlesbrough and Birmingham (Wolves' next two opponents) are both going well, it's a huge challenge to us and we have to rise to it. \n\"We need to bring our fans into play with good performances, we didn't do that tonight. We were very flat. More on this story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:57:23.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
