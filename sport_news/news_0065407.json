After batting down a final pass by California quarterback Jared Goff to preserve a 30-24 homecoming victory at Rice-Eccles Stadium, Hobbs had good reason to talk. The Utes , after all, stood all alone as the Pac-12’s only undefeated team.\n\"We feel like we're the No. 1 team,\" Hobbs said. \"We just want to show the world that we can play with the Alabamas, the LSUs because we've got the guys and we've got great talent.\"\nHobbs added that they also put in a lot of work.\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham acknowledged Hobbs’ enthusiasm, praising the sophomore’s competitiveness and confidence. However, Whittingham took a less bold stance when it came to Utah’s place in the college football landscape — hours before the Utes (5-0, 2-0) moved up to fourth in this week’s Associated Press rankings. They received the second-highest number of first-place votes (16) behind No. 1 Ohio State (27).\n“We are not even to the midway point. Five down, seven to go,” Whittingham said. “There’s a lot of football ahead of us and it’s way too early to start thinking of anything other than the next game.”\nUtah hosts Arizona State (4-2, 2-1) on Saturday. Kick off is set for 8 p.m. MT on ESPN.\n“We have a big challenge next week and we’re right in the middle of the Pac-12 slate now — one right after another for seven weeks or so,” Whittignham said. “We’ll enjoy this for a day or so and get right back on it.”\nThe Utes will do so on the heels of some strong performances. Whittingham noted that the two biggest factors in the win over Cal were forcing six turnovers (five interceptions, one fumble) and Devontae Booker’s 222 yards rushing.\n“I’m proud of our coaching staff and the defensive game plan they put together for Goff. It wasn’t our best night offensively but we got six takeaways and scored 30 points,” Whittingham said. “It was not our best night there but the best thing about being 5-0 is the chance to be 6-0.”\nUtah trailed only once in its homecoming game. The Utes responded to a 7-3 deficit by scoring touchdowns on two runs by Booker and a 54-yard throw from Travis Wilson to Cory Butler-Byrd before the first half was complete.\nKicker Andy Phillips, who got things started with a 44-yard field goal in the first quarter and three PATs, added two more kicks in the second half to cap Utah’s scoring output.\n“We knew it was going to be a battle and we did a great job preparing,” said Wilson, who completed 16 of 26 passes for 170 yards with two interceptions. “All credit to our defense because they played lights out. They got a bunch of turnovers and that gave us great field position.”\nDominique Hatfield and Marcus Williams highlighted the defensive effort. Hatfield made two interceptions, while Williams had a pick and a fumble recovery. Other standouts included Tevin Carter (team-high nine tackles), Gionni Paul (interception, forced fumble), Seni Fauonuku (two tackles for loss) and Justin Thomas (interception).\n“Got to give Utah a lot of credit,” said Cal coach Sonny Dykes. “That’s a good football team and they played really hard.”\nEXTRA POINTS: The Utes have won seven straight games dating back to last season.
