The top points-earners are rewarded with spots in the nine- or 10-man rotation and are showered with items like team-issued T-shirts, hoodies, warm-up suits and game shoes.\nThe system, known as the \"Winners Circle,\" fosters an atmosphere of micro-competitiveness each day while leveling the playing field for guys who aren't established stars.\nProof of its effectiveness, Jones said, lies in what the players say to each other during practice.\n\"You'll hear, 'Hey man, we've got to win this drill. I need the points,' \" he said. \"That's brainwashing them to be competitive. And they like it because it's really giving everybody a fair shake. You can't ever say, 'Coach never gave me a fair chance.' \"\nNo one has taken better advantage than sophomore guard Devonte Banner, a walk-on from Mount Vernon, N.Y. Banner entered last season leading the Winners Circle race, and was rewarded with starts over incumbent point guard Jamel Fuentes in the first two games.\nThe 6-foot-1, 170-pound Banner entered this week leading again, and it's no coincidence.\n\"I take a lot of pride in it,\" said Banner, who lost the starting job only after he didn't perform up to Jones' standards in games. \"It's mainly just to push each other in practice every day to try to win every drill. That's really what it's about. And I don't like losing. Me being at the top just means I take pride in winning every day in practice and go hard.\"\nThe gear Jones distributes, it's important to note, consists of the same items the players would simply receive automatically at most programs. Each NSU player, for example, is allotted six pairs of game shoes, but only gets one pair at the beginning of the season.\nThe rest, like every item beyond a basic practice outfit and warm-ups for team travel, must be earned.\nJones' goal is to be wiped out of stuff.\n\"We have boxes and boxes of Russell apparel back there, but you have to achieve a certain point level to get it,\" said Jones, whose team opens the season Nov. 14 at South Carolina.\n\"If you don't earn them, then we just have a surplus of gear in the back. If you do earn them, then we'll have nothing in the back. And I'm fine with that.\"\nJones takes the points so seriously that the top five earners will make up his starting lineup in the opener - unless they're all guards. In that case, with plans to run a four-guard offense anyway after star forward RaShid Gaston transferred in the spring, Jones would insert the highest earning big man.\nTo prove that no one is immune from the system: Senior guard Jeff Short, who last week was named the MEAC's Preseason Player of the Year after averaging a team-high 19.1 points per game as a junior, until recently faced the prospect of not playing.\nShort, a first-team All-MEAC selection last season, was 10th on the points list for about two weeks.\nA recent surge had him up to fourth by this week, but the Bronx, N.Y., native, knew he was playing with fire. Every post-practice sprint - Jones pits players one-on-one for what he calls \"pride sprints\" down the court and back - took on added importance.\n\"You want to get them points, because the top nine (are) the people that's going to play,\" Short said. \"And coach Jones, he don't play when it comes to that. So we know them three, four points we get for that, we need them points. It could help us out.\"\nUltimately, of course, the system is about helping the team. Jones believes the constant individual effort will pay dividends down the road for the group.\nThe system subtracts points for academic slip-ups like missing class or study hall. Jones, who won 39 games in his first two seasons, said he's found that players who are undisciplined off the court aren't likely to be disciplined on it.\nJones got the idea for the system from former Spartans player Antoine Perry, who worked as a graduate manager for Virginia Tech coach Buzz Williams. The Hokies ran a similar points system, though Jones said theirs was more complex.\n\"They chart even more stuff, but they also have a staff of, like, 20,\" Jones said.\nAs the Spartans practice, a team manager stands with a sheet of paper. As players win drills, Jones shouts to the manager, \"Three points for Banner!\" or, \"Two points for Short!\"\nLater, Jones updates the information on his spreadsheet, and the race thickens.\nBanner, the points-grabbing expert, said the key is to just let them come.\n\"If you go hard, you're going to get the points,\" Banner said. \"You don't have to think about the points first. That just gives you, like, a winning attitude.\"\nWhich is the whole idea.\nDavid Hall, 757-446-2367, david.hall@pilotonline.com \n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
