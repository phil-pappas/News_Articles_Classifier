Global cricket icons Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne will headline a star-studded lineup of renowned cricket players from around the world in the inaugural “Cricket All-Star Series,” a three-game series in New York City, Houston and Los Angeles. The historic tour marks the first time these legends have played in the U.S., and also renews the famous rivalry between “Master Blaster” Tendulkar and “King of Spin” Warne. The “Cricket All-Star Series” kicks off on November 7 at Citi Field in New York City, with the second match taking place on November 11 at Minute Maid Park in Houston . The final match in the series will be on November 14 at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. The format will be T20, a much shorter and boisterous form of cricket with the games taking around three hours instead of multiple days. “Bringing this cricket match to Minute Maid Park is a great opportunity for us to once again host a marquee event and for Houston to experience a sport that is increasing in popularity around the world,” said Astros President of Business Operations Reid Ryan . “These types of events make Minute Maid Park a great fan venue year-round, and are part of our commitment to bringing the best in entertainment and sports to Houston.” “Americans are so passionate about sports, and I think there’s a huge potential for cricket to take off,” said Sachin Tendulkar. “This is also the first time that international cricket will be played in these beautiful baseball stadiums in New York City, Houston and Los Angeles, which will be a lot of fun. We’re also planning some other events and festivities in each city so we can reach as many fans as possible. It would be great someday to see cricket bats right alongside the baseball bats, basketballs and soccer balls in America.” Tickets will be available for presale today. Tickets will go on sale to the general public on Thursday, October 8, at 9:00am CST at www.ticketmaster.com . Fans can also purchase tickets at the Minute Maid Park Box Office or by calling 800-745-3000 800-745-3000 FREE .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:24:10.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
