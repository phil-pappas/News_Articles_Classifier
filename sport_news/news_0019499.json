(AP) - Authorities say that a man barricaded himself in his apartment and started shooting at police to resist an eviction.\nWarren Strain, a spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, says Brookhaven Police and other authorities are involved in a standoff with a man that began after 6 p.m. Monday. Brookhaven, with about 12,000 residents, is 50 miles south of Jackson.\nStrain says the standoff began because the man was resisting eviction.\nMultiple media outlets report that an officer was injured on the scene Monday, possible from shrapnel from gunfire, but those injuries are not life-threatening. Brookhaven Police Chief Bobby Bell later told reporters no one had been shot.\nStrain said local authorities asked the Mississippi Highway Patrol to send its SWAT Team to the apartments.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
