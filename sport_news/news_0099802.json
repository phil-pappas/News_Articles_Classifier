You (the media) asked me what’s surprising (from a team or player perspective at training camp so far), it’s his defence. He’s in the right place, he gets there quickly, with a sense of urgency, with force. He’s known as an offensive player, but his defence has been the most impressive thing to this point.” \n“I just want to come into training camp showing that I can defend,” Bennett said. \n“In the past, I haven’t really been healthy to kind of prove that. Last year was up and down, I was trying to prove that it’s going to be a consistent thing.” \nBennett will get a couple of chances to show this new wrinkle to the team he toiled for last year — the Minnesota Timberwolves — on Monday night at the ACC and on Wednesday in Ottawa. \nThe Wolves, with a crowded front-court, agreed to buyout Bennett, who was acquired in the Andrew Wiggins-Kevin Love deal, just before NBA camps started. \nBennett played down any revenge angle, insisting he is just trying to prove himself in general, to the entire NBA world, not to any one franchise in particular. \nHis focus is on staying on the court. \n“Everybody just wants to prove themselves, but at this time, I just want to go out there and not take myself out of the game by taking early shots, forcing everything,” Bennett said.. \n“I just want to get into a rhythm, get into the flow, get everybody open, set screens, run and defend.” \nBennett was the last Raptor to leave the court on Sunday, working on his jump shot, until being forced to depart because the Wolves had a scheduled practice. \nBefore departing, he had a chat with interim Wolves head coach Sam Mitchell. \nCasey said he likes giving players a chance to shine against their old clubs, because he thinks they are more motivated than usual for those contests and was impressed by Bennett’s recent play, but said, “I’m not going to force-feed anything.” \nBennett said the ankle he hurt in a recent game against Los Angeles is fine, he has had two full practices to test it and is ready to make his home, pre-season debut for the Raptors. \nHOME COOKING \nBennett and Cory Joseph said it had been years since they were home for Canadian Thanksgiving. They took advantage. \n“Haven’t been here for it in a long time. Had a very nice Thanksgiving dinner last night,” Joseph said. \nBennett said it has been so long that he had actually forgotten, until a few days ago, thinking he’d have to wait for turkey until U.S. Thanksgiving like usual next month. \nAmerican DeMarre Carroll was quite curious about whether the holiday was similar here, but was pleased to hear that sweet potato pie is often on the menu in Canada as well. \nLithuanian centre Jonas Valanciunas’ post-practice message to the media as he left the practice court? “Happy Thanksgiving, Canadians.” \nSHOOT THE BALL \nOne thing Casey wants to see more of, is his outside threats letting it fly more often than they have over the team’s first three games. \nPatrick Patterson, in particular. \n“Pat’s a shooter. He has one thing to do, he shouldn’t be thinking about anything else,” Casey said earlier this weekend. \n“He’s one of the best three-point shooters in the league and that’s what he has to do. Shoot the ball. They have the green light, the three-point shooters. That’s what we have to do. It gives the offence a rhythm. A lot of bad things happen when three-point shooters don’t take their shots.” \nToronto shot 2-for-11 from deep against the Clippers, 4-for-16 against the Warriors, but 10-for-21 in an impressive performance in the most recent game against the Lakers. \nPatterson has not attempted a single three-pointer and has scored only six points in 56 minutes so far. \n“Our three-point shooters, they’ve got to take those shots and that will help get those numbers up,” Casey said. \nYOUNGSTERS THRIVING \nToronto’s bevy of youthful talent have turned a few heads so far. \n“Norm Powell, Delon Wright, Bruno (Caboclo) has grown. I’m really impressed with our young guys, where they are in the growth process,” Casey said. \n“Are they ready to come in and win an NBA game for you right now? I don’t know, but they’re growing, they’re developing. We’ve got some good pieces for our program, for our organization.” \nCarroll will need a backup at small forward and Caboclo still has a long way to go, but seems ahead of schedule. \n“Bruno, his talent is through the roof, but it’s a process,” Carroll said. \n“His biggest thing is he’s got to get out there and play. He’s got to learn, get out there, get knocked around, maybe get dunked on by LeBron here and there. It’s just about going through it sometimes. ... He’s been really good. Hopefully he can get out there and get some time and kind of get used to playing NBA basketball.” \nJoseph’s message to the kids? “I tell them, ‘You can’t get sped up, just go out there, be aggressive and now’s the time to make mistakes, so don’t be shy.’” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:15:52.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
