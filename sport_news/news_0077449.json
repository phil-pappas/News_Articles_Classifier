H-F's Justin Hall scooped it up and raced 68 yards for a touchdown to give the Vikings a 14-3 lead. \nThe Griffin kick-return unit failed to catch H-F's ensuing kickoff. But the Vikings did at the Griffin 28-yard line. \nA minute later, H-F's Devonte Harley-Hampton (17 carries, 132 yards, two touchdowns) crashed in from the 2-yard line to give the Vikings a 21-3 halftime lead. \nThe second half featured a valiant effort from the Griffin defense led by defensive linemen Ben Christensen and Dan Cooper, free safety Jayison McCorkle and linebacker Pat Carr. Refusing to lose, the Griffin defenders turned back the ball on a fourth and goal at the Griffin 1-foot line in the third quarter. \nMcCorkle, who already had a fumble recovery in the first half, blocked a Viking field goal attempt with 10 minutes left in the game. Carr scooped up the blocked kick and raced 56 yards down to the Viking 21-yard line. \nBauer hit Griffin wide receiver Logan Winkler with a pass at the Viking 18. Winkler was nailed with another hit and fumbled the ball. Game over. \nBauer went 11 for 16 passing for 82 yards and Morrissey had 11 carries for 73 yards. \nWith the win, H-F (7-0, 5-0) shares the SouthWest Suburban Blue penthouse with Sandburg (6-1, 5-0).
