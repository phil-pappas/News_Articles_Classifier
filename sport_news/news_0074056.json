Ocean’s star running back carried 29 time for a game-high 229 yards and a touchdown to lead the Spartans to a 26-12 non-divisional win at home over Manasquan.\n“Tyler is the best running back in the Shore Conference,” said Ocean head coach Don Klein. “In a game like this, we were going to lean on him heavily and he made some big plays for us.”\nThe Spartans started the game with 26 unanswered points behind a strong first half from Thompson. On the Spartans’ first drive of the game, Thompson took a handoff 53 yards before being tackled at the 2-yard line. On the following play, junior quarterback Kenny Pickett took a keeper up the middle to put the Spartans up 6-0.", "external_links": ["http://www.hudl.com/athlete/2002665/tyler-thompson", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/4675205/kenny-pickett"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:05:50.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
