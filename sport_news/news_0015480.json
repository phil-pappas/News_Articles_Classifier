(Offensive coach) Ralph Andrews did a good job against their defensive schemes today. We had to establish the running game, and this was the game Alvin needed to have.” \nPacheco ran for 234 yards and four touchdowns of 60, 43, 27 and 21 yards on 21 carries and tossed in two receptions for 78 yards, including a 73-yarder that set up another TD in Central Catholic’s 48-27 thumping of the Blue Eagles that delighted a happy Homecoming crowd at J. Birney Crum Stadium. \n“I’d have to say this was my best game of my career,” said Pacheco with a smile as bright as the full-bore sunlight that shone all afternoon long. \nWhat made Pacheco’s powerhouse runs so impressive was that he was hardly touched on his touchdowns. He was through the hole so quickly and was so nimble with the football that Nazareth’s tacklers hardly had a chance. \nThe Viking offensive line of senior tackle Tyler Maxsim and junior tackle Chris Ocasio , senior guards Nick Ghasab and Brian Lloyd , and junior center Damien Ganchoso did an excellent job of opening the holes for Pacheco. \nBut it was Pacheco’s moxie once he had the ball that was truly eye-popping in his breakout game as a featured back. \n“(Andrews) told me the plan was to give me the ball a lot today,” Pacheco said. “I had to be sure I was ready to play today.” \nPacheco said that staying focused on the task at hand was the key for him and the Vikings as a team. He chalked up recent Central Catholic defeats to Freedom and Parkland to a lack of focus and overlooking the foe at hand. \nThat was not a problem Saturday. \nCentral Catholic had let Nazareth creep within 35-13 in the third quarter after a 28-0 start. With Blue Eagle playmakers such as sophomore wide receiver Jahan Dotson (5 catches, 143 yards, 2 TDs) on the loose, Nazareth’s never really out of almost any game. \n“That was the talk at halftime,” Cupples said. “It’s never over. With their playmakers, it’s a nail-biter until the end.” \nBut Pacheco saved his coach the expense of a manicure with his third-quarter heroics. \nHe intercepted a Travis Stefanik pass and returned it to the Blue Eagle 27. On the next play, Pacheco raced into the end zone off the left side on a dazzling run for a 41-13 lead. Then he capped a 91-yard Viking drive with a 21-yard TD burst to make it 48-13 and start the running clock with five seconds left in the period. \nIt was an effort truly worthy of a workhorse – which Alvin Pacheco certainly was Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:26:37.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
