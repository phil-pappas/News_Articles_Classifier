He was asked if he normally shook hands of players before every game, the implication that if not, he was essentially saying thank you and farewell. Edsall, his frustration evident in his voice, growled that he's done that before every game, then stood up and walked out to a smattering of applause.\nUSA TODAY\nNo. 1 Ohio State shakes off Maryland\nMaryland is idle this next week, presenting a logical time for a transition to an interim coach.\nIt appears a coaching change at Maryland is inevitable barring a massive and immediate turnaround. Maryland is 2-3 this season and had been non-competitive in its previous two games: a 45-6 loss at West Virginia and a 28-0 home loss to Michigan in which it managed just 105 yards of offense.\nEdsall is 22-34 at Maryland. Earlier this year, he signed a contract extension through 2019, but only a portion of that salary was guaranteed.\nYou'll want to see @RandyEdsall 's response to a reporter asking about shaking players' hands before today's game. http://t.co/fxBT5513wT\n— BIG 10.10 (@BigTenNetwork) October 10, 2015", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27bc20a0648d3d758267943605077cf85d476c38/c=271-0-2212-1941/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/usatsports/4a4816078f27722d840f6a7067000387.jpg", "https://twitter.com/RandyEdsall", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2015/10/10/no-1-ohio-state-struggles-then-shakes-off-maryland-49-28/73734536/", "https://twitter.com/BigTenNetwork/status/652937488554594304", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2015/10/08/maryland-coach-randy-edsall-status-future/73590462/", "http://t.co/fxBT5513wT"], "published": "2015-10-10T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:11:34.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
