Photograph: Ben Hoskins/Getty Images \nA fter a smashing knockout victory on debut, star Indian boxer Vijender Singh will face Englishman Dean Gillen in his second professional bout and the part-time firefighter has promised to be a 'dangerous opponent' in the bout scheduled in London, on October 30. \n- I am hoping to replicate my success in pro boxing: Vijender Vijender made an immediate impact in his professional debut this month when he destroyed Sonny Whiting in three rounds at the Manchester Arena.The 29-year-old, who will be celebrating his birthday a day before his second fight, will face Nottingham's Gillen over four rounds as he looks to register his first win against an unbeaten pro-fighter.Gillen made his pro debut in May this year with a points win over Shaun White and followed that up in September with a points win over Lewis Van Poetsch.The fight between Vijender and Gillen also represents a Battle of the Badges, with the Indian being a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Haryana and Gillen a firefighter serving in Nottingham.As an amateur, Gillen's highlight was to win the 2013 World Police and Fire Fighter Games in Belfast where he knocked out all of his opponents to claim the gold medal and is now aiming to extinguish Singh's fire in the ring.\"I've watched him in the Olympics and in his pro-debut, he's a world class kid and I can't wait to get in there and put him to the test,\" the 33-year-old Gillen said. \"He's an Olympian and that speaks for itself, he's a hero in his country and he's idolised by millions of people, but at some point he'll have to get beaten and that could well be his second fight against me,\" he added.Vijender is training in Manchester with coach Lee Beard as he aims to beat Gillen and stay on track to achieve his history-making dream of becoming India's first-ever World professional boxing champion.\"I can't wait for this fight against Gillen, he's talking the fight and it looks like he will bring me a challenge in my second fight,\" said Vijender.\"From what I have seen of him he looks like a good opponent who will push me and I hope he does because then the better I will fight, I rise to my opponent and it brings the best out in me,\" he added. Gillen said he would be no pushover against the Indian, who claimed bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.\"I'm certainly no journeyman and I'm not going in to make up numbers, I'm here to fight and win. I know the odds are stacked against me, but when you're facing life risking tasks through your job then fighting someone like Singh is a walk in the park,\" he said.\"I will be coming for him. I've got the heart of a lion and a serious will to win. I've got a strong jab and the reach to take advantage of him, backed up with a solid chin and a real desire and with nothing to lose, I think I'm going to be a really dangerous opponent for Singh. Add to the fact I've never lost to a Police boxer in the amateurs and with stacks of pride and honour on the line, I refuse to lose,\" he asserted.Vijender, on the other hand, said he is unfazed by Gillen's unbeaten record so far.\"He's got an unbeaten record, albeit two fights, and it's a big motivator for me to claim his first loss, if I can stop him, like against Whiting, then that will be another good win for me,\" he said.\"While I was pleased with my pro-debut there is still plenty that I need to work on in my defence and offence and I've been training hard with Lee to correct things and improve, it's a continual process and it will happen fight by fight.\"Being a fireman, he'll be used to dealing with fire and coping with heat but this is one fire he won't be putting out and it will be an entertaining fight for the fans in my first pro fight in the capital,\" he added.
