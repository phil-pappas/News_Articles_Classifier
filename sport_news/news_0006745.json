Even with the Patriots on a bye week, today is supposed to be for football. But for every team that didn’t make the playoffs, today is also the last game of the season in Major League Baseball. Most of these games are totally meaningless. The Red Sox and Indians are playing a game in Cleveland today that will not change anything. So that’s absolutely what I’ll be watching today. The structure of the baseball season builds in far more meaning and more chaos than might be obvious, but even a quick glance at any given day’s highlights, or any random Thursday plucked out of the schedule, will show something strange, or even unique. On top of that, this past month has offered plenty of hope for the Red Sox' future. The outfield trio of Mookie Betts, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Rusney Castillo looks like it could last a decade. The pitchers, from Wade Miley to Rich Hill to the young bullpen arms in Matt Barnes, Noe Ramirez and Robbie Ross Jr. have offered hope that the staff isn’t a complete black hole. There are more, of course. Hope springs eternal and wait ‘till next year and blah blah blah. But we know all that already. What’s left for today is a little more open-ended and difficult to define. And that’s what I’m looking forward to. Beyond looking to the future, one great byproduct of this past month has been an appreciation for just watching inspired baseball every night. They did their damnedest to keep the Yankees from clinching a playoff spot this past week, throwing everything at them and stifling the party and the team’s 10,000th win as long as they could. They shut out the Orioles for three games after being abused by them for most of the season. And within those games and others have been the little things — another ridiculous Bradley catch, or Deven Marrero’s first home run sailing into Yankee Stadium’s right field stands. They all fall into the collection of memories that will eventually detach themselves from their games and stand alone. Today’s the last game. Even then, the Red Sox have a recent history of memorable, meaningless final games. Butch Hobson’s 1993 Red Sox needed one more win in their last game to finish at .500, and it took 14 innings against the Milwaukee Brewers at Fenway to ultimately not accomplish that goal. In 2006, the injury-ravaged Sox played one of the more memorable games of the year, with Devern Hansack throwing a five-inning, rain-shortened, unofficial no-hitter. Those last games in otherwise lost seasons were the outliers, strangely compelling match-ups with nothing on the line. They’re also a by-product of the 162-game schedule, where on any given night any bizarre thing could happen. This afternoon is the last chance of that in 2015, for the Red Sox and the Indians and for most of the league. It’s not the kind of thing that’s typically remembered in the history books, but something could happen. The grind and attrition and relentless nature of the schedule allows for that every time out. So today, Rick Porcello could twirl a gem, work his sinker and slider and dominate Cleveland for his 10th win. He could bomb and give up 10 runs before his first out. He could throw 100 pitches over 5 2/3 innings and leave with a no decision. I have no idea. But that’s what’s great about the game, and that’s what I’ll miss. Enjoy football today. I’ll be tuned in to the Red Sox, just in case they get weird again. Nick Tavares' column appears Sundays in The Standard-Times and at SouthCoastToday.com .
