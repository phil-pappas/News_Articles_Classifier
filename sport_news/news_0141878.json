It’s pretty easy to figure out. \nAlabama’s offensive linchpin and identity for the 2015 version of the Crimson Tide rests in one player — running back Derrick Henry. \nWhen Alabama makes a concerted effort to get him on track early, things go well for the Crimson Tide. \nWhen Alabama does not, the offense appears to be in quicksand. \nThat thinking nearly cost Alabama its ninth straight win in the traditional orange and crimson rivalry with Tennessee on Saturday. \nThe Crimson Tide held on for a 19-14 victory that left more than a few among the 101,821 on-hand at Bryant-Denny Stadium a little uneasy … especially after the Vols took a late 14-13 fourth-quarter lead. \nBut it didn’t have to be that way. Alabama and Tennessee were tied at 7-7 at halftime. Alabama was fortunate it wasn’t worse because of a pair of Vols’ missed field goals. The Crimson Tide struggled on offense in the first half. \nJake Coker was sacked three times, and it could have been worse. \nThe only viable option on offense in the first half was Henry, but he was limited to only nine carries for 53 yards and Alabama’s only score. The second half started differently. \nHenry carried on the first four Alabama offensive plays to open the third quarter for 21 yards, but it meant so much more for the grand plan. When Henry is the focal point, it makes everyone else better. \nThe offensive line is charged up taking it to the opposition. \nPhysical football. Any offensive lineman will tell you they want to run block a heck of lot more than any of them want to pass block. \nQuarterback Jake Coker has more time and confidence to work. \nReceivers O.J. Howard, Calvin Ridley, Richard Mullaney and ArDarius Stewart have more room running their routes. \n“We want to get him the ball,” Howard said. “When he’s effective in the running game, it opens all of us up in the passing game.” \nJust watch opposing linebackers and defensive backs as they are physically worn down and edge closer to the line of scrimmage. \nIt’s a win-win. But even on that drive, Alabama forgot all that. \nHoward’s reception on first down, set up Alabama with a second-and-goal from the 1-yard line … Henry got the ball once, and that was it. \nAn incompletion by Coker on third down in the direction of Ridley, and Alabama had to settle for a field goal to take a 10-7 lead. \nNick Saban and Lane Kiffin don’t need to pull a Pete Carroll when he elected not to give the ball to Marshawn Lynch at the end of the Super Bowl. That’s why the Patriots are NFL champions, and the Seahawks aren’t. \nThis isn’t Saban’s best Alabama team. Few will question that. But it is coming together, and the Tide is progressing through its schedule. \nAnd, regardless of a narrow win over Tennessee, the Crimson Tide set up a classic game at home with unbeaten LSU on Nov. 7. \nBut go with your best. \nBack-to-back attempts for Henry in that situation and Alabama may not have needed heroics in the last 5 minutes to secure a nailbiter. \nOn the final game-winning drive, Henry carried the ball on five of eight plays, including the go-ahead touchdown on a 14-yard run with 2:24 left. \nHenry finished the game with 143 yards on 28 attempts — his fifth game with more than 100 yards this season — and has 1,246 yards and 16 touchdowns while averaging more than six yards per carry. \nTwo weeks from now, get Henry the ball. Early and often. If this team wants to reach its championship aspirations, there’s one way to do it. Kiffin, Saban … don’t be shy. It’s your best chance. \nAnd, if the Alabama braintrust forgets Henry midgame, just look on the other side of the field because Les Miles and Leonard Fournette are going to be bringing a nearly identical freight train to take it from you. \nBrad Zimanek is the Advertiser’s Consumer Experience Director/Sports Editor.
