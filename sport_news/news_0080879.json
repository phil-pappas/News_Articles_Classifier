Now it's a matter of getting used to the guys around me.\"\nMuamba had a few teams interested when he was released by the Indianapolis Colts on Sept. 5. He finally accepted a deal with Montreal that included a fat signing bonus for the rest of this season and reportedly could pay up to $230,000 in 2016.\n\"It was the best decision for me,\" he said. \"I'm happy.\n\"I'm excited about the next few weeks and the challenge that's ahead.\"\nThe challenge includes trying to help the 5-8 Alouettes get into the playoffs with only five games left in the regular season. Already three wins behind the other three East Division clubs, Montreal's best bet will be to try and get a crossover to the West Division semifinal.\nMuamba not only brings proven skill to the position, but he is also Canadian, which means the Alouettes will be able to dress an extra international player at another position.\nThe Congo-born Muamba spent a few years in Montreal as a child before his family moved to Toronto, where he learned his football. Returning to Montreal means more opportunity to use his first language, French.\n\"Being in Winnipeg and the last year and a half in Indianapolis, it was tough to practice French,\" he said. \"Even with my brothers it became English.\n\"But it's part of my culture. I'm getting comfortable doing interviews as well. I didn't play football when I was here, so a lot of the terminology I don't know. I never used football terms in French. I have to think about how to translate them. I'm learning.\"\nHis older brother Cauchy is a safety with the Edmonton Eskimos while his younger brother Kelvin, an undrafted receiver from Wilfrid Laurier University, was among seven players added to the Alouettes practice roster on Thursday.\nMuamba was drafted first overall by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 2011 from St. Francis Xavier University and had two strong seasons before trying his luck in the NFL. He played for the Colts in 2014 but was released after training camp this season.\nThe Alouettes hope he will bolster a defence that was their backbone this season until surrendering 30 or more points in a brutal span of two road games in five days last week.\n\"So far's he's done a good job,\" linebacker Kyries Hebert said of Muamba. \"There hasn't been any lapses in communication and I think that's the most important thing at that position.\n\"We don't feel we're going to miss a beat.\"\nCoach and general manager Jim Popp said cornerback Jonathan Hefney, on the wrong end of a collision in Ottawa, addressed his teammates before practice. Hefney will miss the rest of the season with shoulder and arm injuries.\n\"He's going through therapy but he has a positive attitude and that's good to see,\" said Popp.\nNote to readers: This is a corrected story.
