The 2013 champion struck two eagle threes during his third round in the Chinese gambling enclave on Saturday to move onto 15-under and two clear of defending champion Lahiri, who pipped the Australian to the title last year. The Indian, who had a difficult debut at the Presidents Cup last week, produced an eagle two to go with two birdies in his round of 68 as he looks for his third win on the Asian Tour this year. “We had a great time last year. Two years back, he was way ahead and I almost chased him down. Last year I managed to chase him down. He’s probably been waiting for this for a full year. I think we’ll both be ready for it,” Lahiri said. Lahiri’s compatriots Chiragh Kumar and Rashid Khan were also on the tail of the 42-year-old big-hitting Hend. Kumar fired a three-under 69 to sit alone on third on 11-under with Khan a further shot back in a tie for fourth with Australian Sam Brazel after a 68. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:21:34.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
