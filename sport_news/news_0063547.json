Steve Lewis/Durango Herald photos Durango High School senior midfielder Mason Stetler was the man of the match by ending the game with a goal and an assist, as the Demons beat the Grand Junction Tigers 4-1. T he last time the Durango High School boys soccer team met the Grand Junction Tigers the game ended in a stalemate tie However, this time was different, as the Demons got revenge and controlled the whole game for a 4-1 win Friday at the Riverview Sports Complex in Durango. Durango (8-3-1, 3-1-1 Class 4A/5A Southwestern League) now has a better view of the league with the win and moved into second place while owning the tie breaker with Grand Junction (6-5-1, 4-2-1 SWL). In front of their grandparents, the family connection was alive for the Demons when senior midfielder Mason Stetler scored a goal, which was assisted by younger brother Luke Stetler, a junior. Mason also finished the game with an assist. “I love it; we have that chemistry and talk about scoring all the time,” said Mason Stetler, son of Anne and Mark Stetler. “In an important game like this, it was awesome.” The goal came with two minutes left in the first half when both Stetlers found themselves near the goal. The ball was coming off a few headers and was in the air before it finally came to Luke, who passed it perfectly to Mason for the score. The Demons played on the offensive early with a 4-3-3 formation that helped sophomore Elijah Fenton score the first goal of the match. The goal, which was unassisted, came 13 minutes into the game. “That was the most heart and passion they’ve played with all year,” Durango High School head coach Dalon Parker said. “In the first half, there were moments where (Grand Junction) would dominate the possession role. In the second half, we were the ones who were dictating the flow and speed of play. They played amazing actually.” Parker added that he felt his team killed two birds with one stone. The Demons played with passion and showed Durango was ready for a playoff appearance. Parker’s squad also flat-out played good soccer. “The individuals have gotten better over the week,” Parker said. “So you’re seeing a plus from that. Almost all of the goals we scored came from patterns and plays that we worked on in our sessions, so that is pretty cool to see.” With Durango beating Grand Junction, the cards are set for the Demons to win league outright. The loss, however, takes Grand Junction out of contention. “We have to continue to win,” Parker added. “It’s good to run into these great caliber teams, and it’s great for the league.” Durango rode the game with stellar play from junior goalkeeper Seth Marvin-Vanderryn, who finished the game with eight saves. Durango’s third goal came from senior Aidan Aggler, who tapped the ball into the net during a scramble with the assist coming from Luke Stetler. DHS sophomore Saylor Longfellow finished the day up with the fourth goal for Durango on an unassisted rebound goal. Durango out-shot Grand Junction 16-6 while the Tigers had two corner kicks and the Demons one. Durango will continue league play when it takes on Grand Junction Central at 11 a.m. Saturday at Riverview Sport Complex. Both teams sit on top of league standings, and the winner could determine the league champion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:19:26.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
