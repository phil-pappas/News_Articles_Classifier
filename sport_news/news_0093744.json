The gaudy number wasn’t just paid attendance, either.\n“They were there,” said Leiter, now an MLB Network analyst, “and they loved it.”\nPitcher Dave Stewart, a World Series winner with three franchises, described the early-’90s crowd as “electric, one of the best baseball atmospheres I’ve been in.”\nNow, pent-up excitement 22 years in the making is ready to consume Toronto again and rattle the rafters at the rebranded Rogers Centre. As the Blue Jays play host to the Texas Rangers in American League Division Series Game 1, baseball’s longest playoff drought ends with ace David Price taking the mound to start the franchise’s first postseason game since Joe Carter ended the 1993 World Series with a walk-off home run.\nLeiter even had a revelation when he returned two weeks ago to broadcast a Yankees-Blue Jays series: “I think the crowd is better.”\nIn short: Younger, more raucous and, as Leiter noted, possessing a deeper understanding of baseball now that the franchise has been in Toronto nearly 40 years.\nIn ’93, the franchise had four future Hall of Famers — Roberto Alomar, Paul Molitor, Rickey Henderson and general manager Pat Gillick — not to mention Carter, who’d hit 396 career home runs, and five starters who would win 130 or more games. John Olerud, Molitor and Alomar finished 1-2-3 for the batting title, the first teammates to do so in a century.\nThe new edition plays an exciting brand of baseball with nearly as much star power. The majors’ home run leaders and top-scoring offense by more than 130 runs has a strong MVP candidate in Josh Donaldson, who’s followed in the lineup by Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion, a trio that mashed 120 home runs.\nAt the trade deadline, when the club added Price, shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, outfielder Ben Revere and relievers LaTroy Hawkins and Mark Lowe, Toronto went from fourth place and a losing record to runaway division winners, with sellouts in 20 of the last 21 games for the highest season attendance, 2.8 million, since 1993.\n“Once I got traded over, it didn’t matter what time the game was — noon, 1, 3, 7, midnight, it didn’t matter — these guys, this city, this country came out and supported us 100%,” Revere said.\nTony Fernandez, who batted .333 as the starting shortstop in the ’93 World Series and led the team with nine RBI, recently returned to Toronto on behalf of his eponymous charitable foundation.\n“The atmosphere that we felt was very similar to 1993 when I came back,” said Fernandez, now an ordained minister. “The city had baseball fever. Everybody was talking about baseball. Before that, it was hard to see the ballpark half-empty.”\nIn those fallow decades, the Jays were perennial also-rans; only once did they finish second in the AL East but did so a distant 10 games back of first place. Stewart, now the Diamondbacks general manager, said the 1994 baseball strike also “took a little wind out of the sails,” which he saw firsthand when he returned as assistant general manager (and interim pitching coach) in 2000.\nOf the 1993 team, Stewart said, “The fans were the 26th player on our team,” and now that extra man is back. There may even be a tangible impact, especially when the roof is closed — which increases the volume and the temperature.\n“It can turn 95 into 96,” Price said. “It can make that hitter get to that pitcher's pitch. It pumps you up.”\nThe players not only hear the crowd’s deafening roar, but they also literally feel their presence.\n“It would be so muggy with all that body heat,” Revere said.\nThat’s right, with upwards of 48,000 packed in — renovations have lowered capacity slightly — the air quality in cavernous Rogers Centre is affected, all 700-feet diameter by 310-feet tall for some 56.5 million cubic feet. It may even influence game action, to the benefit of the home ballclub.\n“I think the ball carries a bit better,” Lowe said.\nThe Jays hardly need the help with four right-handed superstar power hitters generously donating game-used souvenir baseballs to fans in the left-field bleachers.\n“It’s just been electric, every crowd has been enormous,” Lowe said. “I remember being on the visiting side this year in Seattle, looking around and going, ‘If only this place could fill up. I want to see what it’s like.’ I got traded here, and I’ve experienced that.”\nRevere had been with the Phillies and visited the Jays the week of the trade deadline and was so happy to learn he was traded to Toronto that he said he got on his knees and said a prayer of gratitude.\n“I had my mind blown that the lineup is that good that you’ve got Troy Tulowitzki leading off for your team,” Revere said. “I was just shaking my head out in centerfield because they were just dropping bombs left and right.”\nBoth current and former players speak of being shown kindness, respect and dignity by the locals. That’s part of the reason Fernandez, who began his career here, kept returning — he had four discrete stints with the Jays — and was glad to be a midsummer acquisition in 1993.\n“To come back and be part of a winner—I couldn’t have been happier especially back home, basically,” said Fernandez, who remains Toronto’s all-time leader in games, hits and triples. “Canada was, for me, and still is like my second country. My children were born there.”\nThe city so resonated with Stewart that he donated money and spent time volunteering to feed a turkey dinner to the homeless at a Toronto chapter of the Salvation Army — the day before his 1993 ALCS Game 6 start. (He allowed two runs in 7 1/3 innings to earn the win.) “Toronto is a great community with great people,” he said, calling the reception of players “unbelievable.”\nThat affection will be measured in decibels and degrees today, just as it has been the past two months.\n“From pitch one, everybody's been on their feet, really into it,” manager John Gibbons said. “I don't know how it can be much different, to be honest with you, as loud as it's been, as enthusiastic as they've been.”\nThat almost sounds like a dare.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:09:21.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
