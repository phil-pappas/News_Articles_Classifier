The Redskins had the first possession of OT, and Kirk Cousins moved the team to midfield. When wide receiver Ryan Grant slipped on a pass route, Alford caught Cousins' pass and was left with open field down the Falcons' sideline for the touchdown. Devonta Freeman's apparent 13-yard TD catch in the final minute of regulation was ruled incomplete on a review. Freeman scored on 6-yard run two plays later to give Atlanta a 19-16 lead. Dustin Hopkins' 52-yard field goal on the final play of regulation forced overtime. The Falcons (5-0) overcame two interceptions and a lost fumble by Matt Ryan. Freeman had 27 carries for 153 yards and the touchdown. The Redskins (2-3) were denied their attempt for their first back-to-back wins in almost a year - since Weeks 7 and 8 in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:17:32.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
