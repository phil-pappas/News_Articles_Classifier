Cowboys, you only have your woman-beating defensive end to blame for the beatdown you're about to receive. There are very few subjects that are off-limits when it comes to sporting theater. In the buildup for a big game, bulletin board material may be frowned upon, but it's still all too commonplace, as braggadocio is inevitable with teams full of professional athletes. But bringing a man’s wife into the discussion? Especially when the person making the comments missed 19 NFL games for the way he treated a woman himself? Stupid. Just stupid. Not only will that fire up Tom Brady, it’ll fire up his offensive linemen, as well. While they’re busy punching Hardy in the face, Brady will be busy dismantling the Dallas “D.” For any teams left on the NFL schedule, take what happens today as a learning lesson. Show tape of this game in your locker room and meeting room — heck, force your most outspoken players to sit in a dark room and watch highlights of this game “A Clockwork Orange”-style. Maybe then the message will get through to them. The Cowboys are sure about to receive it, loud and clear. Nick Friar (2-1): Patriot 31, Cowboys 14 First off, no Tony Romo creates a massive headache for the Cowboys against the undefeated Patriots. While the New England secondary still has to prove itself, Brandon Weeden should be an easy task for them to deal with. The other big advantage the Patriots have is the same one they have every week — no one on the opposing roster can cover Rob Gronkowski. Only on rare occasions do you see one player take the tight end down. He’s too much to handle and he creates openings for other receivers. That’s not to say Julian Edelman needs Gronk’s help. The slot receiver creates almost as many headaches for opposing defensive backs as his slightly larger teammate does. On top of everything else, the Cowboys lost to the scuffling Saints, while the Patriots have had two weeks to prepare for their first game at Jerry World — rather, AT&T Stadium. Tom Brady’s mission to show the league he can play with footballs at any PSI continues with him leading the Patriots to a 4-0 start with this Week 5 win. southcoasttoday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:40:46.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
