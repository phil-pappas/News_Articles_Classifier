At the last home game against California, it was alarming to see many fans streaming for the exits with 5:34 to play after a field goal put the Bears up, 30-21. Two minutes later the Huskies cut the lead to six with a field goal on a drive that very easily could have netted a touchdown. Washington had the ball again with more than a minute left, and was only a Jake Browning TD pass away from winning the game. \nA new breed of Husky fan is in the house. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing. They may be just as exuberant as longtime UW fans, but perhaps not as hard core. On many occasions in the recently renovated stadium, young fans around me left at halftime to go to the beer garden and never returned for the second half. \nI wasn’t able to go to a lot of games during the glory days of UW football under legenddary coach Don James. But my recollection was that the team ran onto the field in front of a raucous, packed house. The memorable moments at Husky Stadium — such as “All I saw was purple” game against USC — was not only driven home by a ferocious Husky defense but fueled by a frenzied crowd. These days, kickoff is near and all I see are empty seats. \nGranted, I’m a bit of an anomaly here. I’m a college-football and college-basketball junkie. While pro athletes play for a paycheck that never seems to be enough, I prefer to watch the players who play for their school and their state (and, yes, with a caveat of a paycheck in their future). My obsession with college sports is so bad I once coaxed my family to attend an Arizona State spring football game while we were vacationing in the Phoenix area. \nI embrace and savor the whole college football game-day experience. I love watching the teams warm up on the field, while the opposing head coaches stand together at midfield engaging in what I can only speculate is nervous chitchat. I love the pregame routine by the UW marching band, rolling down the field in the “W” formation playing “Bow to Washington”. I love watching Dubs, the Husky mascot, lead the team onto the field to the sound of the siren. And I love every minute of the game. \nIt has been a lifelong passion. My dad took my brother and me to Husky games, beginning in the 1960s –– which makes me older than dirt. It was a different era. Kickoff was always 1 p.m. Husky Stadium had a steeply crowned natural-grass field to help drain water. Even so, games in October and November were often played in the mud. I remember the pungent smell of cigar smoke wafting over the stadium and the sight of older men dressed in overcoats and fedora hats. \nI have vivid recollections, sitting in our bleacher seats behind the east end zone, watching Orenthal James Simpson of one of those great USC teams execute to perfection what was called “Student Body Right.” He would take the handoff and drift to the right, wait for his future NFL offensive linemen to create a crease, then hit the hole and sprint 70 or 80 yards for a touchdown. \nFrom those same end-zone seats in 1970 I watched the debut of quarterback Sonny Sixkiller, who passed a heavily favored Michigan State team silly in a 42-16 victory. Coming off a 1-9 record the previous year, in which Washington ran a wishbone offense, Husky fans had never seen anything like it. I watched the game clock behind the west end zone, not wanting it to ever reach zero. \nThis Saturday night’s game against Oregon promises to be an electric atmosphere. My advice is to arrive (in your seats) early. Savor the game-day experience. And let’s hope there’s an even better reason to stay late. \nRick Lund is a news presentation editor at The Seattle Times, and a former assistant sports editor at the paper. \nWant to be a reader contributor to The Seattle Times’ Take 2 blog?
