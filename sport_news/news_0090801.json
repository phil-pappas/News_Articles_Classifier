It’s merely a four-digit number on a website that apparently catalogs track and field performances nationally, an inventory item from the 2011-12 indoor season, one entry among 13 others for Philadelphia’s Roman Catholic High. The question mark next to his name—evidently no one endeavored to confirm what grade he was in—is a little disconcerting. But the chronology and the participant and the school fit. There is William Fuller, and the 200-meter dash time recorded two days before Christmas.\nAt the time, Fuller was fresh off his junior season of football and emerging as a standout receiver. He joined the track team before leaving it in short order when his hips began to hurt after a couple meets. He’d always been pretty fast. He was excellent at tag in elementary school, he recalls. But in those typical high school arguments about who was faster than whom, the kid who would become one of the most lethal wideouts in college football never came up. He is chagrined to concede this, but he understands why. After all, William Fuller’s 200-meter dash performance, logged for eternity, was 23.83 seconds.\nThis seems O.K., even brisk by normal human measure. But it’s two seconds slower than the time fellow Notre Dame receiver Chris Brown posted four months later in South Carolina . The two friends have compared these numbers. That does not mean they understand them.\nCollege Football Video Roundtable: Which surprise unbeaten team has best odds to reach playoff? by SI Staff", "external_links": ["http://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/AthleteRecords.aspx?SchoolID=6604&S=12012"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:17:01.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
