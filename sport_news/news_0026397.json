Audit and compliance committee chairman Domenico Scala said that FIFA president Blatter could be culpable of ''falsification'' of accounts over the 2011 payment of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) to Platini. Platini, the president of UEFA, said the money was owed from his job as an adviser to Blatter between 1998 and 2002, but there was only a verbal agreement for the debt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:25:34.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
