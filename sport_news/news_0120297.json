More Headlines Bill Simmons rails against ESPN during panel \nESPN pulled most of its videos from YouTube after failing to reach an agreement with the site's new subscription service, YouTube Red. Several of ESPN's YouTube channels, including \"First Take\" and \"Grantland,\" were affected and stripped of their videos. \nA spokesperson for ESPN said the sports giant had removed the videos. She said the videos would now be available for free on ESPN's digital platforms. \nThe video removal stems from a contract issue with YouTube, which is about to lauch YouTube Red. \nYouTube Red will be a subscription-based service and will offer videos ad-free. It will also have off-line capabilities and special features. \nDisney signed a new agreement with YouTube, which will ensure that select Disney content is available on YouTube Red, according to a YouTube spokesperson. \nAlthough Disney is ESPN's parent company, ESPN hasn't been able to join the subscription side of YouTube because of rights and legal issues with various sports leagues. \nOnce YouTube Red goes live in the U.S. on October 28, companies that have not agreed to its terms will have their content blocked on the regular YouTube site. \nBecause ESPN was unable to join YouTube Red it was forced to remove its videos from YouTube. \nSpokespeople from ESPN and YouTube could not comment on whether ESPN would eventually be part of the subscription-based service. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
