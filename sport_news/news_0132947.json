It was about ... toilet paper. The British press was fascinated and a bit insulted by the tidbit uncovered by The New York Times that the Jets brought 350 rolls of their own toilet paper to England to replace the thinner version usually found here. Mangold, who visited England in July as part of an NFL delegation, was asked whether he had any issues with British toilet paper on that trip. \"It seemed fine, no issues,\" Mangold deadpanned. Whether an extra-clean feeling will do anything for the Jets on Sunday remains to be seen. But the players and coach Todd Bowles seemed happy with how they felt Friday afternoon after arriving here. Here's a sampling of some of the other buzz heading into the contest:\nGame in, game out, Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie draw the most headlines in the Jets' secondary, but cornerback Buster Skrine will draw the high profile assignment of stopping Jarvis Landry, Miami's top slot target, on Sunday. \"I'll be ready for it,\" Skrine said. \"I'm just ready for the challenge. You always like to go against the best receiver.\" This week's task will be to keep second-year star Landry from catching passes from quarterback Ryan Tannehill. At 5-foot-11, 202 pounds, Landry creates space with his disciplined route running. — Kevin Armstrong, New York Daily News The Jets have planned in meticulous detail just about every minute leading up to Sunday's game against the Dolphins at Wembley Stadium in London. Meetings, feedings, practices and even leisure time spent on sightseeing are scheduled for specific times, though coach Todd Bowles would prefer his players save the tourist stuff for a later date...What the Jets can't calculate is whether they'll be returning to the US with a win or a budding quarterback controversy. Ryan Fitzpatrick will make his fourth start as the Jets quarterback against the 1-2 Dolphins. Geno Smith, the incumbent starter who missed most of training camp with a broken jaw after being punched by a teammate, figures to be the backup quarterback for the second straight week. — George Willis, New York Post Kacy Rodgers spent the past seven seasons as a defensive assistant coach with the Miami Dolphins. And if the new Jets defensive coordinator knows anything about Ryan Tannehill, Rodgers expects the Dolphins quarterback to play much better than he did last week against Rex Ryan's blitzing Bills. Tannehill passed for 297 yards and two touchdowns but threw three interceptions — one a pick-six — and was sacked twice in Buffalo's 41-14 mauling of the Dolphins. Now Tannehill will try to rebound against the Jets. And Rodgers says the Dolphins quarterback will not be afraid to test Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie. — Ohm Youngmisuk, ESPN.com. Eric Decker is officially listed as \"questionable\" on the injury report, but the sensible move would be to rest the veteran wide receiver against the Dolphins on Sunday. Less than two weeks after Decker sprained his PCL in the second half of the Jets' primetime upset over the Colts, he still hasn't practiced fully yet. Decker was limited for a second consecutive day after the Jets' less-than-full-speed practice at the London Irish rugby club's practice facility on Friday in front of about 100 media. The company line is that he's a game-time decision. — Manish Mehta, New York Daily News", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/jets-cb-skrine-tasked-stopping-dolphins-wr-landry-article-1.2382128", "http://espn.go.com/blog/newyork-jets/post/_/id/54678/kacy-rodgers-task-is-to-stop-his-old-team", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/eric-decker-listed-questionable-jets-london-game-article-1.2383187", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/sports/football/jets-head-to-london-with-a-detailed-game-plan-and-thats-just-for-their-laundry.html?smid=tw-nytsports&smtyp=cur&_r=0", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/02/calvin-pace-toilet-paper-proves-jets-are-nfls-best-organization/", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/01/ryan-fitzpatricks-a-bad-start-away-from-a-geno-controversy/"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:09:11.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
