But those days are over. Manziel is currently the backup quarterback for the Cleveland Browns , while Evans is a second-year wide receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . \nBut that doesn't mean Evans won't support his friend whenever he gets the chance. He showed up in College Station, Texas on Saturday for Texas A&M's game against Alabama. \nAnd he was wearing a Manziel jersey. true â€” Colin Deaver (@KAGS_Colin) October 17, 2015 \nNotice something? Yeah, that's a Browns jersey. Is it a big deal? Maybe not for most people, but some Buccaneers fans might have a problem with it. \nBut Evans is thinking about his friend first -- a friend who was back in the news on Friday when it was revealed that he had been pulled over by the police earlier in the week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:46:15.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
