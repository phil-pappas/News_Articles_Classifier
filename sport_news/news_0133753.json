There are a dozen of them altogether, all from the same source, each prompted by a Louisville loss.\nIt was Fischer’s fate to be a U of L fan who delivered the mail to Lou Tsioropoulos.\n“He wanted to know what my affiliation was,” Fischer said, recalling his introduction to the late Kentucky basketball star. “He said, ‘You and I are going to have a rough time.’ I said, ‘No sir. I’m going to deliver your mail and I’m going to do it right.’ ”\nAnd so he did. But in late November 2001, Fischer opened Tsioropoulos’ mailbox to find an unstamped letter addressed to the letter-carrier. It contained a lengthy expression of feigned sympathy for Oregon’s 90-63 trampling of Rick Pitino’s first U of L team, and it would become the first in a series of treasured keepsakes.\n“Rick lost 12 regular season games that year,” Fischer said, “and I have the cards to prove it.”\nCoach Adolph Rupp on Jan. 16, 1954 in Lexington itemizes on his fingers the points he wants his players to observe.

(Photo: John Wyatt, AP)\nWhen Lou Tsioropoulos died on Aug. 22, nine days short of his 85th birthday, he was remembered primarily as a member of championship teams at UK and with the NBA’s Boston Celtics, as a basketball coach at DuPont Manual High School and as an administrator at several Louisville schools.\nYet when friends, relatives and former students gather at 1 p.m. Saturday at Manual to celebrate Tsioropoulos’ life, they can also testify to his prolific and resourceful writing, to small-script essays befitting the space limitations of greeting cards, to poems penned on the shirt cardboard that came back from the dry cleaners, and to philosophical riffs inscribed on toilet roll tubes.\nRecounting his life and lessons in a fill-in-the-blanks book for his daughter, Tara, Tsioropoulos Quote: d from the Greek philosopher Epicurus, the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the Biblical Book of Proverbs. If he was not the best player on Kentucky’s 1951 NCAA Championship team, he was likely its most learned.\n“Lou had a lot of nicknames,” said Bill Olsen, former U of L athletic director and a longtime neighbor. “He was known as ‘The Golden Greek,’ as ‘Mr. T,’ but I would call him ‘Plato.’ He would get into all this philosophy and start talking about these deep things. He could talk on any subject.”\n“He just had a mystique,” Jan Tsioropoulos said of her late husband. “You just wanted to know more about him when you were around him. We were married 51 years, and I still haven’t completely figured him out.”\nLike a lot of children of the depression, Lou Tsioropoulos was adamantly opposed to waste. His survivors considered him “frugal” — how many people cut up cereal boxes to use the inside panels for writing material? — but he was also known for a generous spirit and a weakness for Stetson hats.\nBuy Photo Lou Tsioropoulos would write on almost anything, including toilet paper rolls and dry-cleaning shirt boards. (Photo: By Pat McDonogh, The C-J)\nLike a lot of former principals, Tsioropoulos struck an intimidating figure to young students, but he was also the type to lead neighborhood children on impromptu parades following memorable Kentucky victories.\nLike a lot of accomplished athletes, Tsioropoulos was keenly competitive, but he retained a philosophical perspective on the results. If he was not entirely a study in contradictions, neither was he a personality easily pigeonholed.\nIn February of 1968, one week after his daughter’s birth and three years after being voted the city’s Coach of the Year, Tsioropoulos opened his home to The Courier-Journal’s Dave Kindred to discuss a Manual season that had started with 14 straight losses. This was the last and least successful of Tsioropoulos’ five seasons as a high school head coach, a 2-19 finish to a previously banner basketball career.\n“I’m still giving my best,” Tsioropoulos said, “but I’m losing. Losing. It started me to thinking, to re-evaluating things. I mean, just why are we playing?\n“Just why are these high school boys playing basketball? Naturally, we want to win. I was never on a losing team. But I had adversity, too. Financial adversity — I came through that. Adversity with my back — I survived.\n“Now, these boys at Manual are down. If they stay down, if they just lie there, it would be a crime. A sin. There’s a lesson to be learned. What we want is a good attitude, a 100 percent effort to win. We don’t expect a 5-11 boy to outjump a 6-6 boy, but we want him to try.”\nLou Tsioropoulos stood 6-foot-5, and his basketball abilities were augmented by a football disposition he developed as an All-America high school player in Lynn, Mass. He might have played football for Paul “Bear” Bryant at UK — his arm strength engendered shock and awe — but he told Manual’s “Old Goat Radio” that he was taking so much punishment practicing that, “I was getting punchy. I didn’t want to be that way anymore.”\nA Boston Celtics team including Lou Tsioropoulos. Photo courtesy of the Tsioropoulos family. (Photo: Photo courtesy of the Tsioropoulos family.)\nStill, if Tsioropoulos’ UK athletic career was narrower than it might have been, his No. 16 basketball jersey has risen to the rafters of Rupp Arena, one of 43 recognized as “retired.”\nThough Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp had so much difficulty spelling Tsioropoulos that he had cards printed for official scorers, he called on him liberally, as a guard, a forward and to defend the pivot.\n“He was never a good shot,” former UK manager Humzey Yessin recalled, “but his great qualities of rebounding and defense (are) what impressed coach Rupp. And his aggressiveness. He was a fierce competitor. One time he had to be restrained from going after (UK assistant) coach (Harry) Lancaster.”\nThe Wildcats won 90 of their 95 games during Tsioropoulos’ career that included: the 1951 NCAA Championship and a 1952-53 season that was suspended following a point-shaving scandal and Kentucky’s only unbeaten season since 1912, which was a 25-0 campaign that came to an abrupt end when Rupp declined an invitation to the 1954 NCAA Tournament.\nUnder rules that have since been abolished, Tsioropoulos was ineligible for the NCAA Tournament because he had already graduated. Faced with the prospect of fielding a team without his three leading scorers — Cliff Hagan and Frank Ramsey were also ineligible — Rupp chose to preserve his perfect season instead of attempting to chase a championship short-handed. (LaSalle won the NCAA Championship that year, three months after a 73-60 loss to the Wildcats.)\nBuy Photo UK's 1952-53 basketball team was given the death penalty by the NCAA for rules infractions.

Lutman, Special to the CJ)\n“I never saw them play,” said former Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall, “but I’ve looked at some film. That team was so complete, with every advantage of basketball skill and understanding the game. And Lou was the enforcer, the guy who didn’t allow intimidation. ...\n“They were hard-playing, tough guys and Lou was a leader.”\nRupp sometimes pushed his players through grueling two- and three-hour practices, setting them up for an exhausting scrimmage against his fresh-legged freshman team.\n“Sometimes,” Tsioropoulos told Olsen, with a rhetorical wink, “I had to impose my will on those guys.”\nThat physical style of play would cause Tsioropoulos to foul out of eight games during the 1953-54 season, but he was able to average 14.5 points and 9.6 rebounds and reach a career-high 30 points in a January game against Georgia Tech. After a stint in the Air Force, he would play a reserve role on the Celtics’ first two NBA championship teams — in 1957 and 1959 — before retiring following back surgery.\nJan Shroyer had heard her future husband’s name on the radio growing up, but she did not meet him until after he had settled in Louisville as a wholesale liquor salesman. Her initial attraction, she said, was purely pragmatic.\nBuy Photo Tara Tsioropoulos, left, Jan Tsioropoulos are surrounded with memorabilia of the late Lou Tsioropoulos, a former UK and Boston Celtic basketball player who was Tara's father and Jan's husband. (Photo: By Pat McDonogh/The C-J)\n“The truth?” she said. “He was tall enough for me to wear my heels.”\nHer interest in sports was then, at best, cursory. Taken to a Manual football game as a first date, she remembers asking about the number of players in the game. Told there were 11, she inquired about which team got the extra player.\nThe relationship survived.\n“We dated maybe three weeks and decided to get married,” she said. “Something like that.”\nTsioropoulos compiled a 44-61 record in his five years as a coach at Manual, then moved into school administration in pursuit of a bigger paycheck. He would become such a fixture at Southern Middle School that Melody Raymond would know him both as a student and as a teacher.\n“He was a great boss,” said Raymond, now the principal at Blue Lick Elementary. “He trusted me, and I was a brand-new teacher, too. ...\n“I knew him maybe a little better (than others) because my mother was PTA president. When my mother was sick and dying, he was one of the last people who came to see her. He came to see mom the day before she died. I can remember her perking up and saying, ‘Well, Mr. T.’ ”\nBuy Photo A collection of messages from colleagues of Lou Tsioropoulos during his tenure with Jefferson County Public Schools was given to him at his retirement. (Photo: By Pat McDonogh/The C-J)\nMiriam “Mims” Oglesby taught science at Southern and remembers Tsioropoulos for his diplomatic demeanor during the stressful first days of mandatory school busing in the 1970s.\n“No matter what went on, he would always handle it with grace and calm,” Oglebsy said. “One time there was a student who was giving everybody a hard time and he was interviewing him. When the boy said, ‘I was afraid,' he said, ‘Everybody was afraid of you.’\n“He was always able to look at a situation and help you see maybe where the kid was coming from, or the situation was coming. I felt like he handled (busing) with as much diplomacy as he could. Parents were upset, the community was upset, (but) he tried to help the faculty to stay on an even keel; tried to make a safe place for them, a comfortable place for them.”\nThough his philosophical bent would suggest Athenian influences, the Golden Greek also had his Spartan streak.\nLarry Fischer recalled accompanying Tsioropoulos to a fund-raiser and seeing him approached by a former student, now middle-aged.\n“I know who you are,” the man said. “You whooped my ass at Manual.”\n“Yes,” Tsioropoulos replied. “You probably deserved it.”\n“He was good to the bottom of his core, but he scared the crap out of me,” said Becky Evans, a next-door neighbor. “I never knew when he was being serious and when he was teasing me.”\nAs he had done in basketball, Lou Tsioropoulos worked at keeping people off-balance. He sometimes injected an invented word into a conversation for the sake of confusion. One of his favorites – and the spelling is uncertain – was \"phlasetic.”\n“He’d say, ‘I don’t know, that’s rather phlasetic,’ ” Jan Tsioropoulos recalled. “And of course no one would want to say, ‘What does that mean?”\nWhat does it mean?\n“Nothing,” she said.\nBuy Photo Lou Tsioropoulos loved Stetson hats, which were displayed along with his UK blanket and his letterman sweater. (Photo: By Pat McDonogh/The C-J)\nThe family room of their East End home contains photographs and artifacts from Tsioropoulos’ basketball career including a 2XL Kentucky letterman’s jacket, a replica Celtics championship banner, and an award from Down Syndrome of Louisville. Though Tsioropoulos had no personal connection to that genetic disorder, he became an enthusiastic fund-raiser, eventually insisting on donations to that cause as a condition of signing autographs.\n“We would get random checks in the mail all year round,” said Diana Merzweiler, executive director of Down Syndrome of Louisville. “I finally nicknamed him the Greek Mafia because nobody ever said no to Lou.”\nA nephew, Mike Johnson, described his uncle as “public and gregarious,” and yet “very private.” When Louisville won the NCAA Basketball Tournament in 2013, Lou Tsioropoulos approached invisibility.\n“I didn’t see him for about a month, said Larry Fischer, the mailman. “He absolutely disappeared. I tried to call him, but he didn’t answer. ...\n“I really miss him.”\nTim Sullivan can be reached at 502-582-4650, tsullivan@courier-journal.com or @TimSullivan714 on Twitter.\nThe UK basketball team celebrates in the dressing room at Madison Square Garden in New York City after beating Illinois, 76-74 to win the NCAA Eastern Regional Finals on March 24, 1951.
