Residential premises of the Chief Minister were also searched by the CBI at Shimla and Delhi last week. Addressing a news conference at his residence here this evening, Shanta Kumar said he had already asked the Chief Minister to quit the office and allow the CBI to conduct a fair, impartial and independent investigation into the cases registered against him and his wife Pratibha Singh pertaining disproportionate assets as alleged by the CBI. He said the Chief Minister had already stated before the public and in various courts of law that he had been falsely implicated by the CBI and Income tax Department and there was nothing against him. If so, then he should not hesitate in quitting. Shanta Kumar said in the present situation, there was no justification in the Chief Minister continuing in the office. All development activities in the state had come to a standstill and there was total collapse of law and order as official machinery was not functioning in the proper manners. He said Virbhadra Singh should understand that the CBI had not registered cases against him without any evidence. “He should first prove his innocence in the court of law which was the appropriate platform,” he said adding it was for the first time in the history of the Indian politics that the residences of a sitting Chief Minister were raided by the CBI by a case registered under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. He said Virbhadra always claimed that he believed in value-based politics and was an advocate for clean political life. He should have left the office on the same day when his houses were raided by the CBI at Shimla. Shanta Kumar said the state unit of the BJP would submit a memorandum to the Governor of Himachal Pradesh tomorrow. He fully supported the stand taken by the state BJP against the Chief Minister and asking the Governor to dismiss the state government without any delay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:23:38.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
