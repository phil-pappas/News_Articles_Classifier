Khan felicitated ace batsman Younis Khan's on record-breaking feat to become country's leading scorer in Test matches. The former Pakistan captain Younis clouted England off-spinner Moeen Ali for six over deep mid-wicket to go past the salient batting landmark of Javed Miandad's 8,832 and became the highest run-getter for Pakistan. \"Younis Khan has been an excellent ambassador of Pakistan cricket. The number of records he has set in the recent past is something we as a nation can take great pride in,? PCB Chairman said in statement on Tuesday. \"He is the only Pakistan batsman to score centuries against every Test playing nation. The feat he achieved against Australia last year -- scoring over 700 runs in a space of just 30 days was no mean achievement. \"I congratulate him on rewriting the record books in becoming the highest run-getter for Pakistan. It was a mountain that none had been able to climb since Javed Miandad played his last innings in December 1993,? he commented.
