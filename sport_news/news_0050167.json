Our schedule has to be a great learning tool for district play.”Chapman has good athletes and will give the Dogs multiple looks on both sides of the ball in the 7 p.m. game Friday. “We have to have a great week of preparation from a mental standpoint and we will have to play a physical game,” Heuer said.Consistency and playing with a sense of urgency are what Heuer wants to see from his players.The Bulldogs showed it in the opening quarter against Concordia. The Dogs, who failed to convert on fourth down in the opening series, executed on their second try.MHS’ Chase Green intercepted Con quarterback Ethan Bechard to set up the Dogs on CHS’ 26 yard line. Five plays later, Bulldog quarterback Tommy Brinegar fought his way up the middle to score on a 6-yard run. Andres Patino’s kick was good for a 7-0 lead with 4:25 left in the first quarter.Con’s Logan Higbee fumbled and Bulldog Greg Martin recovered it to set up MHS’ second score. Marysville marched 50 yards in three plays for a 13-0 lead. Brinegar dove forward on a 29-yard run for the score. Patino’s kick hit the upright.“We came out with a lot of energy and intensity,” Heuer said. “Con found some wrinkles that gave us some trouble until we could clean them up at half. What really hurt was giving them a short field a few times in the second quarter. Multiple scores in such a short time is such a momentum shift.” Con ran out the last 2:19 of the first quarter and scored three times in the second quarter to take a 20-13 lead into halftime.The Panthers marched 54 yards in nine plays to score with a Bechard 13-yard pass to Cole Larsen. Higbee’s kick was good with 9:47 to go before halftime. At the 6:09 mark, Bechard hit Karter Steinle on a 30-yard pass play to put the Panthers up 14-13. After the Bulldogs lost a fumble, CHS scored on a 23-yard series that took four plays before Higbee scored on a 7-yard run.Cameron Miller scored on a 1-yard run in the third quarter to cap a 58-yard drive with 2:40 showing. Higbee’s kick was good.“I say it all the time, but we have to develop consistency,” Heuer said. “We need to find a sense of urgency for each play.”CHS 0 20 7 0 — 27MHS 13 0 0 0 — 13 C M", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:53:13.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
