The introduction of these rules is aimed at increasing pace of play and ultimately combatting college basketball’s long-standing scoring decline , which hit new lows last season. \nThe topic was a central narrative at Big Ten media day on Thursday, with most coaches weighing in on how the rules will impact the game. The foremost issue for Maryland Coach Mark Turgeon, he said, is preparing his team for the variety of defenses it will face as a result of the new rule. Maryland has been practicing with a 24-second shot clock throughout preseason practice to increase its tempo. \n“So we’re going to try to play — we’re going to play them faster than the 30,” Turgeon said. “I think it’s a challenge for coaches. It was hard to get a good shot up at 35 seconds, and it will be a big challenge for us to continue to figure out how to get great shots up with a 30-second shot clock.” \n[ At Big Ten media day, all eyes are on Trimble and Maryland ] \nThe NCAA Men’s Basketball Rules Committee made more than 25 changes in June, and while the shot-clock change headlined the announcement , the alterations are expansive. The restricted-area underneath the basket has grown from three to four feet. Teams will have three 30-second timeouts in the second half instead of four, and coaches can only call timeouts during a dead-ball situation. A timeout called within 30 seconds of a media timeout will become the media timeout. Post defenders will be allowed to play “arm-bar defense” — placing a forearm or an open hand with a bend in the elbow on an offensive player with the ball whose back is to the basket. \nStill, a majority of coaches said Thursday that the changes won’t cause a major makeover to the game. Wisconsin Coach Bo Ryan, who will retire at the end of the season, largely scoffed at the rule changes. He said he has adapted to every rule change the NCAA has thrown his way in three decades of coaching. He introduced a 17-second shot clock to his team before it traveled to Canada for preseason competition two years ago, hoping it could deal with shorter international shot clocks as a result. \n“I think 30 is enough time to get a good shot. You teach good, practice good. They tried it in the NIT and we saw what a huge difference that made; a point, two points, something points per game were scored. Okay. So some genius came up with five seconds off the shot clock to get one more shot. I tell you, I don’t know where they graduated from, but it’s a heck of an idea,” Ryan said. \nSaid Iowa Coach Fran McCaffery: “In terms of playing fast and shooting it early to the clock, we’re trying to do that anyway. Typically, if we don’t, it’s because somebody is trying to stop us from doing that. So I don’t see the shot clock issue affecting our team that much.” \nWhile Turgeon maintained that the changes will not affect his coaching philosophies or jeopardize the college game, it does bring challenges. The NCAA has also pushed to reduce the physicality of the game, which has put Turgeon and his staff at task when it has come to teaching the arm bar in post-defense situations. The coaches haven’t taught the technique in years, Turgeon said, and some of the players simply have no idea how to use it. \n“It gives the defense a better chance. But there’s a lot of coaches that haven’t taught the arm bar in 10 years. It’s a little more difficult to teach than I can remember. There’s some kids I’m coaching that have never been able to put an arm bar on a player in the post,” Turgeon said. “I think for the most part the game will look the same, and feel the same.” \nRoman Stubbs covers the University of Maryland athletics for The Washington Post. sports Success!
