Spain manager Vicente del Bosque said he had no timeline on a return for Silva. \nAguero could miss four Premier League games - including the first Manchester derby of the season on 25 October - and two Champions League fixtures against Sevilla. \nHis absence leaves City with just Wilfried Bony as a recognised central striker, with youngster Kelechi Iheanacho in reserve. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
