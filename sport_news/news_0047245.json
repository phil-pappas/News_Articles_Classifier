Every four years Les Bleus seem to flick the switch to show the world they are not such a bad rugby team after all. While France has never won the Webb Ellis Cup it has made three finals — 1987, 1999 and 2011 — and has never failed to make the quarterfinals. It is some feat considering in 2007, as hosts, it lost the opening match to Argentina and in 2011 it lost pool matches to New Zealand and Tonga when in-fighting was rife and there was a mutiny against the coach at the time, Marc Lièvremont. France has also been involved in some of the tournament’s most exhilarating matches, particularly the 1999 semifinal when it came from 24-10 down to stun tournament favorites New Zealand 43-31. It heaped further misery on New Zealand in 2007 when it won the quarterfinal in Cardiff 20-18 to condemn the All Blacks to their earliest ever exit at a World Cup. Yet in between rugby’s showpiece events the French have repeatedly underperformed. Since its 8-7 loss to New Zealand in the 2011 final in Auckland, the French have finished fourth (2012, 2014 and 2015) and sixth (2013) in the Six Nations tournament that also involves England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy. They have been underwhelming in the annual June and November test series in the intervening years too. Coach Philippe Saint-André used 82 players in his 40 tests in charge prior to this World Cup, something not out of the ordinary for the French. Lièvremont used 82 players in his 38 tests prior to the 2011 World Cup, while Bernard Laporte picked 89 players in 42 matches between the 2003 and 2007 World Cups and 95 in 42 tests between the 1999 and 2003 tournaments. Saint-André’s rotating of players during the past four years has also included 17 different scrumhalf/flyhalf combinations. Yet for all the disappointing results and mediocre performances prior to this year’s World Cup, France once again has reached the knockout phase with victories against Italy, Romania and Canada. The mercurial flyhalf Frédéric Michalak, 32, has rolled back the years and showcased his vast array of skills after being given a second chance by Saint-André. He has sparked the French attack and has become the first-choice No.10 in the process. The forward pack, too, is showing more willingness to engage in the battle at the scrums and the breakdown, something that has not always been evident in recent years. While it has not all been smooth sailing — footage of Saint-André’s furious dressing down of his players at halftime during the match against Romania went viral — the French have again shown they are a team to be reckoned with. The biggest test of the tournament for Les Bleus so far, though, will be Sunday, when they take on the two-time Six Nations champions Ireland, the only other unbeaten team in their pool. The match will determine which team faces likely qualifiers from pool C, New Zealand or Argentina. If France, which has lost its past two tests against the Irish, wins Sunday then it will play the runner-up in pool C, expected to be Argentina, in the quarterfinal. If it loses then New Zealand awaits in Cardiff, Wales, in a repeat of the 2007 quarterfinal. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:38:25.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
