A corn maze of his likeness was created at a farm in Arizona. (Photo by Brian Lawdermilk/Getty Images) Nothing goes together quite like \"Sliced Bread\" and corn.\nAdChoices Joey Logano received a surprise at Dover when he found out that a corn maze has been created in his honor at Schnepf Farms in Queen Creek, Arizona. Logano's post-Daytona 500 celebration was used as inspiration.\nThat's pretty close. There are two other corn mazes next to Logano's - one in the shape of the Shell logo and the other promoting 811, the national call before you dig phone number.\n\"I was blown away by what I saw,\" said Logano. \"The maze is incredible and I have never seen anything like before, nor would I have ever imagined being a part of something like this when I started racing. I think it's very cool that it is symbolic of our Daytona 500 win. That was a pretty big surprise and something I'll always remember. I'm pretty sure I'd get lost inside that thing.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:05:28.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
