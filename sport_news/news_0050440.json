The Colonials would add two power play goals midway through the period, and then a fourth right before the break to make it 4-0. \nThe Colonials scored twice more in the second, with the first coming off another power play and the second moments after a penalty had expired. Merrimack finally got on the board early in the third on a top-corner slapshot from freshman Beatrice Dufour, but that’s all the offense the Warriors were able to muster. \nMerrimack (0-3) will face Robert Morris again today at 3:05 p.m., and will then return home next Saturday to face UNH.
