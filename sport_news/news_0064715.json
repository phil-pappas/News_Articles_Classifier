They'll have an undivided interest in the Big Ten Network and everything that we do. But that doesn't happen overnight.'' \nFull-share conference schools each received an estimated $1 million in revenue shares as a result of the Big Ten Network in 2015. Despite being a key factor in why the BTN reportedly improved its positioning within New York metropolitant-area cable systems owned by Cablevision, Comcast and Time Warner Cable, Rutgers is not eligible for that slice of the revenue pie until 2021. \nRELATED: Rutgers and Maryland additions paying off for Big Ten \n\"Anything that we do (to help financially support Rutgers) would come out of somebody else,'' Delany said. \"Everybody has financial imperatives, every family does, every school does. So there would be no plans to do that.'' \nSpeaking in general terms about the turmoil Rutgers has faced amid a recent string of football controversies, Delany said \"everybody in the Big Ten feels for schools when they have problems.'' \nALSO: Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany on Rutgers: 'They'll get things going in a good way' \n\"I call it collegial empathy,'' he said. \"There's nobody that feels good when somebody goes through a difficult time. I notice in my 26 years that when somebody is down people are there to try to be supportive and helpful. That's what conference members do for each other. That's what we did with Penn State. And that's what we did with a variety of issues that have come up over time. \n\"You see us, we understand accountability but we also understand it's part of our family and we want them to be healthy and whole and we understand what's in the past and what's in the future.'' \nA big part of Rutgers' future on-field success figures to be dependent on how quickly university officials can break ground on a wide-ranging, multi-phase plan to upgrade the athletics facilities for all 24 of its sports teams. \nThe Rutgers governing board in June approved a plan that includes a proposed Multi-Use Facility to accommodate the basketball teams and a Hale Center renovation to bolster the football program in the recruiting arms race. \nWhile Robert Barchi declined to specify the price tag, the university President said the timeline on when the different phases will be built \"is entirely dependent'' on donor support. \nIn late July, Delany said he \"wasn't involved'' in recommending to Rutgers that it upgrade its facilities and on Friday offered his take on the plan. \n\"My reaction is that facilities are important,'' Delany said. \"But so is balancing the budget. So they're going to have to raise (money for) it. I don't think it's fair to ask the institution to do it. It has to be done with private dollars. And it's hard to raise private dollars sometimes. \n\"To be honest with you others have had resources they have not had. So I like the plan. I wasn't involved in the plan. There was no pressure on our part. We love the institution, we love what the institution stands for. So I think over time that they will improve their facilities and I think it'll make them more competitive when they do.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:17:50.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
