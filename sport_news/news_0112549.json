And his teammates.\nThe 2-5 49ers, whose fall from grace is reflected in the plunge of their one-time wunderkind quarterback, have a leader whose confidence is completely lost, according to a report from Fox Sports , and his teammates aren’t exactly picking him up.\nAfter a particularly brutal defeat to the Seahawks on Thursday, in which Kaepernick passed for just 124 yards and was sacked six times, the 27-year-old lost the game and showed signs of losing his locker room.\n“His confidence is completely shot,” insider Jay Glazer said Sunday on a FOX pregame show. “It’s not that [the players] don’t like him. But he’s just alone, on an island in that locker room. There’s not a lot of people he connects with.\n“Confidence-wise, he’s just buried right now.”\nIt’s a meteoric nosedive for the same player who fueled San Francisco to the Super Bowl after the 2012 season, when the 49ers’ fearsome defense — led by coach Jim Harbaugh — and Kaepernick’s dual-threat offense nearly lifted them over the Ravens for the title.\nBut a few short years later, with no more Harbaugh, a defense less of a shell and more of a fine thread of what it used to be, and a sputtering offense in which Kaepernick’s legs are minimized, the 49ers have to wonder if they have the right leader under center.\nFor owner Jed York to contemplate his quarterback is one thing; for Kaepernick’s own teammates to leave him on that island is another.\nWith a seven-year, $126 million deal signed before the 2014 season, it would be difficult for the 49ers to cut rope and go in a different direction at quarterback. But if the 49ers have their future quarterback, Kaepernick needs to find a way out of his hole, and soon.\n  colin kaepernick ,  san francisco 49ers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:03:26.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
