We're trying to batten down the hatches so to speak. The key word here is safety and being smart and getting things done the right way,'' Kokoskie said.\nWhile the Rutgers football team is off from practice Friday and Saturday as it enjoys its only bye weekend of the season, Rutgers has men's and women's soccer games scheduled throughout the weekend.\nPLUS: N.J. weather, emergency social media resources to follow for Joaquin updates\n\"Right now no decisions have been made to postpone the men's (soccer) game Saturday or the two women's games (Friday and Saturday), but our facilities staff is actively monitoring the storm,'' said Anthony Hernandez, an assistant director of athletic communications at Rutgers, who told NJ Advance Media that the women's soccer game versus Michigan State would be pushed up three hours earlier to 4 p.m. Friday.\nOne area of focus is what to do about the Rutgers Indoor Practice and Conditioning Facility — more commonly called \"the Bubble'' — before Joaquin is expected to make landfall Sunday or Monday.\nKokoskie said he will discuss the situation with officials from the university's Office of Emergency Management, local weather forecasters and school's meteorology department before deciding whether to manually deflate the Bubble in preparation for a storm that is currently identified as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130 miles per hour.\n\"I think we're going to have to make a decision by the end of the day (Friday) because obviously over the weekend everyone will be scrambling,'' Kokoskie said. \"So I have to make sure we have the company that operates the Bubble on call. We're preparing right now for it. We're taking all the (soccer) goals out of the Bubble; we're getting everything prepared so that if we need to take it down, then we're ready to go.''\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the forecast boiled down to three possible outcomes for Joaquin in the coming days, each that would bring completely different impacts to New Jersey over the coming week.\nMeanwhile, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie already declared a state of emergency ahead of Joaquin as a precaution.\n\"The biggest concern is what the wind gusts are going to be in our area here,'' Kokoskie said. \"If we have to deflate the Bubble, we will be able to do so. But we're going to wait for what the latest forecasts say.''\nAccording to the Rutgers athletics website , the Bubble is \"the nation's largest air-supported indoor structure.'' The website says the facility measures \"430 x 230 feet in length (and) reaches 80 feet at its highest point'' but in 2011 a new Bubble was installed and it now reaches 94 feet, according to Kokoskie, who said Rutgers officials opted to manually deflate the indoor facility prior to Hurricane Irene and Super Storm Sandy.", "external_links": ["http://www.thisisrutgersfootball.com/page/facilities"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:18:10.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
