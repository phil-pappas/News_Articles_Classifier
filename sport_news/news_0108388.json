That leaves Arsenal bottom of Group F with rapidly shrinking hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages. Another surprise was in store in Belarus, where BATE Borisov upset AS Roma 3-2.\nHowever, Barcelona pulled off a dramatic escape to avoid defeat against Bayer Leverkusen, scoring in the 80th and 82nd minutes to turn defeat into a 2-1 home victory.\n“We are the European champions and we knew that in the second half we had to show it,” said Luis Suarez, who scored the winner.\nHere is a look at Tuesday’s Champions League matches.\nGroup E\nBarcelona’s dramatic comeback was achieved without Lionel Messi, who is set to miss two months with a torn knee ligament, and the team’s injury worries grew when Andres Iniesta was forced off in the second half with an apparent thigh injury.\nSergi Roberto poked in the rebound of a strike by fellow substitute Munir El Haddadi to equalize in the 80th, and two minutes later El Haddadi passed for Luis Suarez to drive in the winner, sending Barcelona to top of the group.\nLeverkusen outplayed the defending champions for an hour and looked set to take revenge for its 7-1 loss the previous time the German side visited Camp Nou in 2012, when Messi scored a record five goals.\nDefender Kyriakos Papadopoulos scored the opener in the 22nd, but Leverkusen faded late and didn’t have the legs to keep up with Barca’s reinforcements.\nAlso in Group E on Tuesday, BATE Borisov beat Roma 3-2.\nBATE was widely expected to be a serial loser in Group E, but two goals from left-back Filip Mladenovic powered the Belarusian team to a surprise victory. Roma staged a second-half comeback with goals from Gervinho and Vasilis Torosidis, but was denied a point when Alessandro Florenzi’s shot hit the crossbar late on.\nBarca rose to the top of the group with four points, followed by Leverkusen and BATE Borisov with three each. Roma is last with one point.\nGroup F\nA goalkeeping blunder by David Ospina helped Olympiacos beat Arsenal 3-2, leaving the Gunners in real danger of its first group-stage exit in 16 years.\nOspina fumbled a corner over his line to give the visitors a 2-1 first-half lead, and substitute Alfred Finnbogason scored the winner in the 66th minute – almost immediately after Alexis Sanchez had drawn Arsenal level.\nArsenal, which has advanced past the first group stage every year since 2001, has now lost both its opening games – and still has two meetings with Group F leader Bayern Munich to come. Bayern beat Dinamo Zagreb 5-0 to take a tight grip on first place in the group.\n“It leaves us in a bad position, but we are still in it,” Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said. “We have to make a result in our next game against Bayern at home.\n“We are not out of it.”\nWenger rested first-choice goalkeeper Petr Cech, just as in the opening 2-1 loss at Dinamo.\nIn Munich, Dinamo never came close to repeating that victory in a one-sided game. Bayern was up by four goals after 28 minutes in a comfortable win that saw a hat trick for Robert Lewandowski and goals for Douglas Costa and Mario Gotze.\nGroup G\nChelsea’s miserable start to the season opened a new chapter as it lost top spot in Group G with a 2-1 defeat at FC Porto.\nJose Mourinho’s former club went ahead in the 39th, when Brahimi beat Branislav Ivanovic and Gary Cahill on the left, with goalkeeper Asmir Begovic pushing away Brahimi’s shot only as far as Andre Andre, who fired a first-time volley into the net.\nWillian levelled with a curling free-kick in first-half added time as Iker Casillas, making a competition record 152nd appearance, didn’t even move.\nMaicon sealed it in the 52nd, putting the Portuguese club level with group leader Dynamo Kyiv on four points, one ahead of Chelsea, which is also struggling in the Premier League.\nIn Israel, Dynamo cruised to a 2-0 win over Maccabi Tel Aviv, which is yet to score a goal in this season’s group stage. Andriy Yarmolenko put the Ukrainian team ahead in the fourth minute, before Junior Moraes struck five minutes into the second half.\nGroup H\nHulk delivered a man-of-the-match performance as Zenit Saint Petersburg made it two wins from two matches in Group H with a 2-1 defeat of KAA Gent.\nHulk had two assists, while Artem Dzyuba scored his first Champions League goal and Oleg Shatov notched the winner.\nMeanwhile, Valencia got its campaign back on track with a 1-0 win at Olympique Lyonnais following an opening home loss to Zenit.\nMidfielder Thomas Matton scored his fourth goal in three games for Gent, equalizing in the 56th minute, but Shatov ended Gent’s 12-game unbeaten start to the season.\nZenit remains on top of Group H with six points, three more than Valencia. Lyon and Gent have one point.\nIn Lyon, Sofiane Feghouli’s powerful strike in the 42nd minute was left unanswered despite the hosts’ heavy pressure in the second half. But a lack of cutting edge and two excellent saves from Valencia ’keeper Jaume Domenech sealed Lyon’s fate.\nLyon could have taken the lead in the 27th minute, when Mathieu Valbuena’s curled free kick forced Domenech to tip the ball onto his post. Valencia also hit the woodwork twice before the interval.\n More Related to this Story Memorable shot from Florenzi gives Roma draw against Barcelona\nSOCCER Arsenal upset by Dinamo Zagreb in Champions League\nUnited’s Shaw suffers double leg fracture in Champions League loss\nRonaldo hat trick leads Real Madrid to 4-0 win over Shakhtar\nThe golden principle of soccer?
