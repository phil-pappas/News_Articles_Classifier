While GEAR UP federal grant money came to the state and flowed through Mid Central Education Cooperative, many schools hired outside contractors to run it in their buildings. \nPrevious Story: GEAR UP Shuts Down; Mid-Central To Conduct Own Audit \nThey were reimbursed by Mid Central for their costs. But now that the state has pulled its GEAR UP contract with Mid Central, the future of the program is up in the air. And tribal schools say they have little direction on what to do next. \nPrevious Story: State Waiting On Word From Feds About GEAR UP Program Future \nMembers of the newly formed Native American Student Achievement Advisory council were in Sioux Falls to meet with educators in the district. And while GEAR UP isn't the focus of these meetings, it's still on the mind of the tribal education director for Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate. \n\"The programs have been running since school started. And now, who knows what's going to happen now. The schools will either have to pick up the cost of that money for the contracts to complete this or else the programs will cease to exist,” Sherry Johnson said. Angela Kennecke: \"Do you have the money to complete the costs?\" Johnson: \"Most schools don't.\" \nJohnson says Tiospa Zina and Enemy Swim Day school were held accountable for the GEAR UP funds and how they were being used. She says the programs made a big difference for students in her schools. \n\"If we lose those programs, that's the sad part of this. That affects the children. These are adult problems and the adults in there need to solve their problems. But don't affect the schools and the programs that have the schools,\" Johnson said. Kennecke: \"Do you feel like your questions were answered by Secretary Melody Schopp when she told you what was happening with the program?\" Johnson: \"Somewhat. She told us what she was able to tell us at this point in time.\" \nBut Johnson says with so much up in the air, tribal schools aren't sure what to do next. Kennecke: \"Do you think the state needs to step forward and give some help or guidance in this issue?\" Johnson: \"I would hope that the state would stand behind GEAR UP at this point in time and the programs that are presently offered out in the school. Because they count on that and no where have they been a part of this big mess.\" \nStacy Phelps, who was appointed by the governor to the Native American Student Achievement Advisory Council, is no longer part of the group. \nPhelps, who ran the GEAR UP program and Scott Westerhuis' nonprofit group American Indian Institute for Innovation, also stepped down from the South Dakota Board of Education last week. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
