His blooper/doinker/flare of a single in the 6th inning arched over the shortstop’s head and landed in shallow left field. It looked more like a women’s fast pitch softball swing.\nBut it worked. It scored Lorenzo Cain and helped lead the Royals to a dramatic, come from behind, 5-4 win over the Houston Astros on Friday. The best-of-five American League Division Series is now tied 1-1 and headed to Texas.  Playoff games and series can hinge on weird plays just like that one.\nSo now what?\nIt’s on to face a guy named Dallas in the city of Houston. Wait, what?  Yeah.  Dallas (Keuchel) in Houston.  It’s the way they roll in the Lone Star State.  They name their kids after towns. I’ve never met anyone in Kansas named Topeka. Or Buhler. Or Gardner-Edgerton. But it’s Texas and people in Texas love them some Texas. \nThe Royals will face Houston Astros ace pitcher Dallas Kuechel. He’s 15-0 at Minute Maid Park this year. He was the starting pitcher for Ned Yost’s American League All-Star Team and he’ll probably win the Cy Young Award.\nAnd he’s got a huge beard. Everything’s bigger in Texas. (Except for the Astros' ballpark that has a short porch in left field.)\nWhen the Astros made their one and only visit to Kauffman Stadium this year they won the first game of the series and extended their winning streak over the Royals to seven games. The Royals snapped the losing streak to the Astros when they won the second game of the three-game series. \nI remember Yost talking after the game about how relieved he was to get that win considering Dallas was pitching for Houston in the final game of the series. \nBut a funny thing happened to the best pitcher in the league that Sunday afternoon. The Royals roped him, knocked him out of the game, early.  The Royals ended up winning the game and the series against the Astros.\nMy point behind this is that anything can happen. Weird things. Unexplainable things. Especially in baseball and even more so in the playoffs. \nThe propeller-headed analytics community will tell you the Royals have no chance to beat Dallas in Houston and win game 3 of the ALDS.\nTell that to the baseball Gods.\nEven tell them the Royals were swept in Houston this year.\nThe math guys care. The baseballs Gods don’t.\nFirst pitch is 3:10 p.m. Sunday in Houston. Not Dallas.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
