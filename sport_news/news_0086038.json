The Mariners held a 17-3 lead in shots and a 6-1 edge in penalty corners. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Oceanside (5-7-1, 24.2602 points) is 10th, while Gardiner (11-2, 116.0204 points) is first in the 14-team region. The top 10 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nMaine Central Institute 2, Oceanside 1 (OT) \nAt Thomas College in Waterville Oct. 6, the Mariners rallied late to tie the game, but the Huskies of Pittsfield persevered as they clawed to their ninth win. MCI led 1-0 at halftime. \nMolly Tobin tied the game with less than a minute remaining in the second half for Oceanside, while Victoria Friend scored in the first half off, an assist from Addi Williams, and another in overtime to win the game for the Huskies. \nLauren Hoppe made four saves in the cage for Oceanside, while Darrian Leonardi also made a player-save in the tough-luck loss. Mikayla Carr made four saves for MCI. \nThe Huskies held a 9-6 edge in shots, while both teams attempted seven penalty corners. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:08:33.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
