Top-ranked Serena Williams is skipping the tournament to rest. Radwanska has qualified for the WTA Finals for the fifth consecutive year. \nIn China’s Hong Kong, Jelena Jankovic of Serbia came back from the brink of defeat yesterday to overpower Angelique Kerber in the final of the Hong Kong Open, putting on hold the German’s hopes of playing in the WTA Finals. \nFourth-seeded Jankovic, who beat Venus Williams in the quarterfinals, was a set and 5-6 down before rallying to beat second-seeded Kerber 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-1 at Hong Kong’s Victoria Park for her 15th WTA title. \nNinth-ranked Kerber needed to win to confirm a berth at the WTA Finals. \nFormer top-ranked Jankovic, 30, who added to her Guangzhou title at the beginning of the Asian swing, relied on her powerful baseline game. \nThe 27-year-old Kerber will now have to rely on a strong showing at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow this week to see if she will remain among the top eight on the Road to Singapore race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:10:11.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
