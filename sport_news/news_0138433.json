Here's Dick Vitale on Larry Brown: \"I have a big problem when a coach puts three major schools on probation during his watch.\" Here's Dick Vitale on Memphis deciding against honoring a head coach who put two major schools on probation during his watch: \"This is really small on part of those in Memphis who forgot about all those great times @UKCoachCalipari gave them.\"\n2. So two on probation is fine but three on probation is a big problem? What about all the great times that Larry Brown gave Kansas fans? What about all the great times that Brown gave SMU fans? Whatever could explain this different approach by American's favorite carnival barker?\n3. Oh, wait! I have an idea. Maybe Larry Brown -- unlike Calipari -- forgot to put Vitale on the payroll? If you recall, Vitale got a nice check for coming to Memphis Madness during the Calipari era. All these years later, Calipari still benefits from the investment.\n4. A story that went unreported from the Memphis-Cincinnati game, as recorded in a recent E-mail:\n\"When we arrived into the Liberty Bowl Thursday night and filtered to our season ticket seats just before kickoff, section 102, row 11, seat 1,2,& 3. We were met with a hornet’s nest, literally. Sometime since the Missouri State game, some hornets took up residence and built a nest right under the seats. For the first 15 minutes of the game people were swatting at them trying to get them to leave, risking getting stung to get them out. Finally the good people at the Liberty Bowl sent down a courageous, daring young man with some hornet spray, and just like the Bearcats in the end, the hornets were overtaken. I think those hornets put up better defensive numbers than the Tigers, but hey a win is a win and that was an exciting place to be. Maybe we should change the name of the Liberty Bowl to the “Hornet’s Nest”?\nTom Liddy\n5. Finally, a small personal story, to counter the one I told recently about my house being robbed. My eldest son, Ben, plays the euphonium. He often likes to practice outside.
