Eight Israelis have been killed, most of them are soldiers.\nOne Israeli Jew and one Eritrean have also been killed by Israeli police after being mistaken for Palestinians.\n*The story was edited by Ahram Online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:04:08.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
