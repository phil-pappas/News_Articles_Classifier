(Photo: Rod Sanford | Lansing State Journal) Offense \nConnor Cook came 2 yards shy of equaling Bill Burke’s MSU single-game record of 400 yards, and the senior quarterback did it with tough throws into tight windows and while dodging Indiana’s pressure all day. The 100-plus-yard games for Aaron Burbridge are becoming second nature, but Cook’s pinpoint passing also has helped make R.J. Shelton and Macgarrett Kings Jr. strong secondary targets. The running game languished with both running back Madre London and starting center Jack Allen out until getting long TD runs late from LJ Scott and Gerald Holmes. Much of that can be attributed to the out-of-need rotation of injured bodies along the line. The bye week should help get the Spartans closer to full strength after this 540-yard performance. \nGRADE: 8 Cook stellar as MSU routs Indiana, 52-26 Defense \nMSU’s second-half performance against Nate Sudfeld and Indiana’s high-octane offense might have been a season turning point and, at worst, a tremendous confidence-builder. The Spartans held the Hoosiers 130 yards of total offense in the third and fourth quarters and just six points. Defensive tackle Joel Heath had a sack and four tackles, helping to keep Indiana to 389 yards – nearly 90 below its average. Grayson Miller and Khari Willis got the start at safety, but they were joined by Montae Nicholson, Matt Morrissey and newly reinstated Mark Meyers in combining for 16 tackles. Sudfeld threw often at Demetrious Cox, who finished with six tackles and two pass breakups. Opposite cornerback Arjen Colquhoun continues to be the surprise of the secondary. \nGRADE: 8 Special teams \nDespite a high snap that prevented one field goal attempt and a short, low, line-drive punt by Jake Hartbarger, the Spartans rebounded exceptionally from last week’s near-disaster at Michigan. Hartbarger’s 56-yard boomer from his own end zone helped flip the field once, Michael Geiger booted a field goal, and R.J. Shelton’s 58-yard kickoff return to start the second half set up an important touchdown. Kickoff specialist Kevin Cronin also had four touchbacks, and Indiana averaged just 19 yards on four kick returns. \nGRADE: 7 Meyers returns for an MSU secondary in need of relief Coaching \nCredit MSU’s Dave Warner and Jim Bollman with exploiting Indiana’s weakest defensive area by letting Cook win the game with his arm. And give equal kudos to their defensive counterparts Harlon Barnett and Mike Tressel for making the halftime adjustments that stymied Sudfeld. Perhaps the most unheralded part of what the staff has done is to juggle bodies with the glut of injuries, both in the secondary and along Mark Staten’s offensive line. \nGRADE: 9 Bottom line \nIt’s a bye week for the Spartans to exhale after reaching 8-0, let their bodies heal from all the punishment they’ve taken since August camp and mentally prepare for the final four-game stretch that will determine their fate in reaching the College Football Playoff. Mark Dantonio will give them a break from practice this week, which means an important road trip Nebraska is next up in … 14 days .
