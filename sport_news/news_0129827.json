Saturday's 3 p.m. contest is the Red's annual United Way game.

(Photo: File photo) Story Highlights The Red team beat the White, 9-8, on Saturday in the annual \"Red-White\" hockey scrimmage at Cornell As of Tuesday afternoon, Lansing football had enough healthy players for Saturday's game at WG/O-M The Bobcats were forced to forfeit last weekend against defending state champion Chenango Forks J.C. Tretter got some air time on Sunday afternoon in the Green Bay Packers' defeat of San Diego CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSaturday night's Cornell \"Red-White\" scrimmage was our town's unofficial welcome to hockey season, though judging from the low turnout at Lynah Rink, many folks still haven't received the memo. \nHere's hoping that many more embrace the frozen pond this weekend, when the Cornell women's team, ninth in this week's USCHO.com national rankings, welcomes second-ranked Boston College for a season-opening weekend series on Friday night and Saturday afternoon. \nThe men will also be in action at the venerable old barn, hosting Canadian universities Ryerson (7 p.m. Saturday) and Laurentian (2 p.m. Sunday) in exhibitions that will serve as dress rehearsals for the team's season-opening home-and-home series with Niagara a week later. \nFans are especially encouraged to make it to Lynah on Saturday afternoon for the 3 p.m. women's game between the Red and the undefeated Eagles (6-0), as it is the Big Red women's annual United Way game. Cornell will donate $1 for every fan in attendance, and money will also be raised from various raffles to be held throughout the afternoon. \nOne of the objectives Saturday will be to challenge the team's single-game attendance record. That was set in the United Way game on Dec. 4, 2010, when 2,326 fans saw the Big Red blank defending conference champion Clarkson, 3-0. That year's event raised more than $3,000 for the organization. \nIn addition to the game and its fundraising aspect, Cornell student groups will be vying for the inaugural \"Cornell and Community Spirit\" trophy, which will be presented between the first and second periods by Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick, himself a member of Cornell's class of 2009. \nAdmission to all women's games is $6 for adults, $5 for seniors, and $4 for Cornell staff and children in grades K-12. Cornell students are admitted free. Get out and support head coach Doug Derraugh's squad, as well as the United Way of Tompkins County. \nFor those of you who missed the \"Red-White,\" the Red team got two goals apiece from seniors Christian Hilbrich and Anna Zorn, and edged the White squad, 9-8. Junior Jeff Kubiak had a hat trick, including a penalty shot with 35.6 seconds to go in regulation, to lead the White team. \nThe game was scoreless for much of the first 30-minute half, but the offense picked up considerably as both teams warmed to the task. Minor penalties resulted in penalty shots, with power-play and 4-on-4 situations built into the run of play. A shootout was staged after regulation time, which ended 8-5 in favor of the Red. \nSyracuse-area freshman Anthony Angello — who probably for the first time in a long time isn't the tallest player on his team, as the 6-7 Hilbrich has him by a couple of inches — scored on a nice top-shelf wrister, and classmate Beau Starrett also broke into the scoring column. The game's lone power-play goal was registered in the second half, by women's junior forward Kaitlin Doering. \nThe Big Red women had their first taste of outside competition last Friday in a 3-2 exhibition victory over Western Ontario at Lynah. Cornell scored three times in a span of 109 seconds early in the second period, then held on as the Mustangs — defending Canadian Interuniversity champions — pulled to within in a goal with 41 seconds to play but could not get the equalizer. Cornell's goals came from junior Brianna Veerman, Doering and freshman Pippy Gerace. \nDerraugh had all three of his goalies — sophomore Paula Voorheis, junior Stefannie Moak and freshman Marlen Boissonnault — play one period, Moak earning the win with six saves in the second. \nThis will be the 11th season behind the bench for Derraugh, a 1991 Cornell graduate, former long-time European professional, and still the last Big Red men's player to notch a 30-goal season. His coaching staff also benefits from some consistency: Danielle Bilodeau is in her 10th season, and Edith Racine her seventh. \nLANSING FOOTBALL GOOD TO GO: As of Tuesday afternoon, the Lansing football team, tied for first place in Section 4 Division V, has enough healthy players to field a team for its regular-season finale on Saturday night at Watkins Glen/Odessa-Montour. \nYou might recall that the Bobcats (2-5 overall, 2-0 Div. V) were forced to forfeit last Friday against two-time defending state champion Chenango Forks as they didn't have the minimum 16 eligible players because of injuries. I heard from Director of Athletics Adam Heck on Tuesday afternoon, and he reported that Coach John Winslow had 20 players suited up for his team's Monday practice. \nThe Bobcats and Seneca Indians will square off at 7 p.m. Saturday in Watkins Glen, with the winner taking the Division V crown. The other prize for Saturday's winner will be not having to play Division IV champ Forks in the first round of the Class C playoffs, set for Oct. 31 at Union-Endicott's Ty Cobb Stadium. The Division IV champ will play the Div. V runner-up at 12:30 p.m., with the Div. V champ facing the Div. IV runner-up at 3:30; the winners will play for the title at noon on Saturday, Nov. 7, at Binghamton. \nCornell graduate J.C. Tretter made the box score in Sunday's Green Bay Packer victory over the San Diego Chargers when he got his hands on a short kickoff early in the fourth quarter. (Photo: Provided) \nTRETTER SIGHTING: It was fun seeing No. 73 for the Green Bay Packers fall on a short kickoff early in the fourth quarter of his team's 27-20 victory over the San Diego Chargers on Sunday afternoon. \nWhile that play normally wouldn't be noteworthy, and certainly wasn't for the vast majority of NFL fans across the nation, a certain faction of them around here were likely excited by it. Of course, No. 73 for the undefeated Packers is worn by 2013 Cornell graduate J.C. Tretter, whose pro career has been marked by a series of injuries that kept him sidelined for most of his first two years in the league. \nHe's listed as a backup offensive tackle, after being tabbed as quarterback Aaron Rodgers' starting center in August 2014, before a knee injury suffered in the final preseason game put him on the shelf until early November. He played in 10 games last year, at tackle and on special teams, and it was in that latter role that he made the box score on Sunday by rushing up and falling on the Chargers' \"pooch\" kick with just over 11 minutes to play. \nThat he should have sure hands is no surprise; a quarterback in high school in western New York, Tretter was converted to tight end at Cornell before bulking up and switching to offensive tackle his junior year. He was a key cog in the line that helped protect record-setting quarterback Jeff Mathews, who's now with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League, playing for his former college coach, Kent Austin. \nSpeaking of Mathews: He picked up his first CFL win on Oct. 9, tossing three touchdown passes — one to former Cornell teammate Luke Tasker — in a 30-15 defeat of the Saskatchewan Roughriders. The game was Mathews' second start since taking over for the injured Zach Collaros. \nTom Fleischman is The Journal's sportswriter; he can be reached at tfleischman@ithacajournal.com.
