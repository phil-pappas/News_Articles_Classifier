(AP Photo/Rick Osentoski) \nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) — The Detroit Lions fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and offensive line coaches Jeremiah Washburn and Terry Heffernan on Monday, a day after the team dropped another game in a listless performance against the Minnesota Vikings. \nThe team announced the moves a few hours after coach Jim Caldwell gave no indication that any major changes were imminent in his Monday news conference. Detroit fell to 1-6 with a 28-19 loss to Minnesota on Sunday. Matthew Stafford was sacked seven times. \nBlocking problems have plagued the Lions all season, limiting Stafford’s effectiveness and the running game’s productivity. \nQuarterbacks coach Jim Bob Cooter is taking over as offensive coordinator. \nDetroit plays in London next weekend against the Kansas City Chiefs. \n___ \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:51:24.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
