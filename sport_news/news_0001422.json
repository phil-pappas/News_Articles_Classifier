Matthew J. Lee/Globe Staff Belichick has always had a fondness for drafting tight ends, and Colorado’s Daniel Graham was the first one to get the call in the first round. He wound up being more of a blocker than a receiver, catching 120 passes for 1,423 yards and 17 TDs in five years as a Patriot. Doug Pensinger/Getty Images Belichick actually traded up in the first round of the 2003 Draft to get Ty Warren, who played seven years for the Patriots, won two rings and was first team All-Pro in 2007. He rolled up 374 tackles and 205 sacks in an eight-year career that was cut short by multiple triceps injuries. Stan Grossfeld/Globe Staff Big Vince Wilfork was the first of two first-round picks in 2004 -- the 21st overall -- and played 11 seasons with the Patriots before moving on to Houston. Wilfork won two rings with New England while making five Pro Bowls and earning first team All-Pro honors in 2012. Jim Rogash/Getty Images The next big-time tight end to be drafted by Belichick was Ben Watson -- picked 32nd overall in 2004 -- who was extremely fast and athletic for his size, but struggled with injuries during his time with New England. Watson caught 49 passes in 2006 and six TDs in 2007, his two best years as a Patriot. Dylan Martinez/Reuters Logan Mankins was the last pick of the first round in 2005, and anchored the Patriots offensive line from the left guard spot until he was traded to Tampa Bay during training camp in 2014. Mankins played the 2011 season, including Super Bowl XLVI, on a torn ACL. Elise Amendola/AP The highest drafted running back of Belichick's tenure, Laurence Maroney looked bound for stardom after his second season in2007, but slowly burned out after that. Injuries slowed him down considerably, and he was traded to Denver early in the 2010 season. Jim Rogash/Getty Images Drafted as the heir apparent to Rodney Harrison at No. 24 overall in 2007, Brandon Meriweather made a couple of Pro Bowls, but shuffled in and out of favor with Belichick during his four years in New England. Meriweather also had multiple incidents with helmet-to-helmet hits. Elsa/Getty Images Like they did with Warren, the Pats traded up to draft Jerrod Mayo out of Tennessee at No. 10 in 2008. He started every game his rookie year and played every snap. Mayo was voted Defensive Rookie of the Year was named first team All-pro in 2010. Ann Heisenfelt/AP The Pats took Devin McCourty 27th overall out of Rutgers in 2010, and he responded by being named second team All-Pro and making the Pro Bowl. He struggled at corner in 2011 and 2012 -- before being converted permanently to safety -- where he again was an All-Pro second teamer in 2013. John Tlumacki/Globe Staff The heir apparent to Matt Light at left tackle, Nate Solder was chosen 17th overall out of Colorado in the 2011 draft. He played some on the right side and as a tackle eligible tight end his rookie year (also Light's final season) before assuming his regular role protecting Tom Brady's blind side in 2012. Matthew J. Lee/Globe Staff The Patriots had two first-rounders in 2012, and used both to work on rebuilding their defense. The first was spent on athletic, pass rushing defensive end Chandler Jones out of Syracuse at 21st overall. He was named Defensive Rookie of the Month his first month in the NFL. Billie Weiss/Getty Images The other 2012 first rounder, Dont’a Hightower was drafted 25th, and combined with Jones on a strip sack touchdown in their first game together against the Titans. Hightower had a breakout year in 2014, making a key tackle at the end of Super Bowl XLIX to set the stage for the game-winning interception. Mike Roemer/AP Belichick took a flier on interior defensive lineman Dominique Easley from Florida with the 29th pick in 2014, thanks to Easley's two torn ACLs while in college. He played in just five games as a rookie, making 10 combined tackles and grabbing an interception. Bruce Kluckhohn/USA Today Malcom Brown was selected with the final pick of the first round of the 2015 draft out of Texas. At 6-foot-2, 319 pounds, he will be expected to help make up for the loss of Wilfork to Houston, as well as provide more athleticism up front.
