Comment Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 10:58 PM » RELATED CONTENT • GALLERY: RFA, Whitesboro, and CVA Football Thomas R. Proctor High School’s football team rallied from an early 21-0 deficit and came back to tie the game in the fourth quarter, but a two-point conversion try that would have given the Raiders their first lead was stopped and Baldwinsville hung on for a 35-34 victory in Friday night’s showdown of Class AA-2 co-leaders. It was the first loss of the season for the Raiders, (2-1, 4-1), who used two fourth-quarter touchdown passes by sophomore Logan Wilcox to give themselves a shot at the win on the road. Anthony Graham’s touchdown catch made it 28-28, but Baldwinsville (3-0, 4-1) went back on top with 2:46 left to play. Wilcox then connected with Jamarious Morgan on a 31-yard screen pass that pulled Proctor within 35-34, but after a timeout, Morgan’s attempt to run for the go-ahead two points was stopped with 2:07 left to play and the Bees held on for their fourth straight win. Morgan rushed for 87 yards on 12 carries, including touchdown runs of 55 and 5 yards, and Wilcox finished 13-for-18 passing for 260 yards and two scores. DeJae Johnson ran for 54 yards on seven carries for Proctor, Graham caught five passes for 61 yards, and Cam Magnussen had a 10-yard touchdown run and caught a 73-yard pass that led to Morgan’s touchdown that made it 21-21 after three periods.
