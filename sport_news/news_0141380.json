For a coach that has yet to lose a set in nearly two years in the Mother Lode League, she remains the most serious and focused person in the gym. When the ball hit the hardwood inside Bud Castle Gym for the 25th and final point of the third set, and Sonora completed the three set sweep of the Bret Harte Bullfrogs, Evans let out a sigh of relief and smiled. “I am very excited with the way we played tonight ,” Evans said. “We’ve been practicing really hard for specifically this match. There were certain things that we worked on that I felt we executed very, very well. I think our mental preparation and physical preparation paid off tonight .” Heading into Tuesday night’s clash, Bret Harte was tied for second place in the MLL at 3-1, two games behind a perfect 5-0 Sonora. The ‘Frogs were viewed as the team that would finally be able to make Sonora sweat and prove that it is not invincible. But, like the five school’s before it, Bret Harte fell to the queens of the court. “I think we just had some mental things to work through,” said Bret Harte coach Jessica Delgado. “It wasn’t intimidation because our girls were really excited to play Sonora. I think they just kinda beat themselves in this one.” The ‘Cats took the three sets 25-13, 25-5 and 25-12. Sophomore Riley Patterson had another terrific night, leading Sonora with nine kills, 19 digs and five aces. Kiana Pisula had a team-high 22 assists and finished with 11 digs. Senior Kelsie Evans was second on the team with seven kills and led with three blocks. For the ‘Frogs, Addison Stafford had 11 of the 12 Bret Harte assists. Christine Lora had a team-high 17 digs and Katie Juarez finished the night with nine kills and 11 digs. One major goal for Sonora was stopping Juarez, the talented Bret Harte sophomore. One major reason for the success of the ‘Frogs this season has been thanks in large part to the outstanding play of Juarez. For Evans, Juarez is not just a player on the other side of the net, but a girl who she has known since birth. “I’ve known Katie since she was pretty much born,” laughed Evans, “To watch her over the years, she’s an excellent leader. She’s definitely the person out on the court that you want to see her continuously raise her teammates, which is exactly what she does out there.” Juarez, nor her teammates had an answer to stop the ‘Cats and fell to 3-2 in MLL play and 15-6 overall. On Tuesday the ‘Frogs will host Amador. “Sonora is just really smooth and we weren’t there to pick up the pieces,” Delgado said. “It’s an unfortunate loss for us.” Sonora (18-2, 6-0 MLL) is off the rest of the week, and will not play again until next Tuesday at home against Amador. Though Sonora took round one against Bret Harte, it still has to play the ‘Frogs once more, next time on the road. “It will be tough on the road for anybody because any given night in this league, anybody can beat anybody,” Evans said. “But, as long as we stay mentally and physically prepared and just make sure we have a mental balance going into everything, that we can do it.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:54:49.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
