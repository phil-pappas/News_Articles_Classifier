Lose Friday night at Dothan’s Northside Methodist Academy, and Lakeside will miss the playoffs. \nLakeside was unable to hold onto a fourth-quarter lead and dropped its fourth game in the last five outings after a 3-0 start, falling at Macon-East Academy Friday night, 35-20. \nThe Chiefs led, 20-14, entering the fourth quarter. \nLakeside opened the scoring on a 12-yard run by Desmon Richards and Mack Atkins added the PAT. After Macon-East scored the next two touchdowns, Richards scored on a 4-yard run to make it 14-14 at halftime. \nReid Potthoff connected with Frank Garrison on a 28-yard scoring toss to make it a 20-14 advantage before Macon-East took charge in the fourth quarter. \nThe Knights took the lead with 11:53 left in the game on a 22-yard run, adding the PAT to make it 21-20. They scored again with 8:02 left and added an insurance TD with 1:28 left. \n“As a team it was like we just went flat midway through the third quarter,” lakeside Coach Keith Jones said. \nAs a result, Lakeside finds itself in a three-way tie for second place in AISA Class 2A, Region 1 play with a 3-2 league mark with Springwood and Northside Methodist. Macon-East is 3-3, having wrapped up its region schedule. \nSpringwood beat Northside Methodist, 35-6, earlier this season. Lakeside beat Springwood, 32-21, in the season opener. \n“We started pretty salty,” Jones said. “I felt confident throughout the game we were going to pull away.” \nAt halftime, Richards had piled up 93 yards on 12 carries, but he finished with 136 on 23 attempts. Potthoff, not able to handle kicking duties due to a bruised foot, completed 6 of his first 9 passes, but finished with 116 yards through the air. \n“We played well defensively,” Jones said. “We held (Macon-East) to 43 yards in the first half and just 142 for the game, most of which came on their last two drives.” \nIf Lakeside wins at Northside Methodist, it would host the winner of the Wilcox Academy at Pickens Academy game that will also be played Friday. \n- - - \nClass AA Region 1 Standings \nTeam Overall Region", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:25:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
