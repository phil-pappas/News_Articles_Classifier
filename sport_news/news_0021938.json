Photo by Dhon Wellons/TMC Sports Information \nBoth soccer teams for The Master’s College bagged signature wins over Vanguard University, while Mustang volleyball beat Hope International and Concordia (Mich.) in a pair of 3-1 victories. \nMen’s Soccer \nIt was only fitting in a much-hyped match featuring two of the NAIA’s Top 25 clubs that one of the nation’s best players would make the difference. \nThat’s exactly what Humphrey Mahowa did. The TMC sophomore striker and last year’s Golden State Athletic Conference Player of the Year scored the winning goal 3:05 into overtime to lift the 17th-ranked Mustangs past No. 3 Vanguard, 2-1, Saturday afternoon on Reese Field. \nThe dramatic win avenged a 2-0 loss at Vanguard on Sept. 23 and improved the Mustangs to 9-3-1 overall and 3-2 in the GSAC, where they sit tied with Westmont and San Diego Christian for third place (nine points). \nMahowa’s conference-leading 10th goal of the 2015 campaign was made possible by some terrific Mustang defense, as goalie Casey Phillips made a save 1:53 into the extra stanza and his fellow defenders teamed for a block before the ball was turned back up the field. \nOnce the ball got across midfield, Benjamin Tembo and Mahowa went two-on-two against the Lion defenders and Tembo found his teammate, who put the ball past Vanguard’s Brandon Gomez at the 93:05 mark for the golden goal. \nCommenting on Tembo’s assist, Rickard said, “Benji has been really stellar the past three games and his skill produced the chance that Humphrey finished.” \nThe Mustangs got to overtime because Zach Klindworth scored off a Christopher Logan assist with in the 77th minute in regulation to tie the game. It was Klindworth’s third goal of the season. \nThis week, TMC hits the road to face new GSAC member Menlo on Thursday and at William Jessup two days later. \nWomen’s Soccer \nIf TMC team was looking for a signature moment for its 2015 campaign, it found it Saturday afternoon. \nWith just eight seconds left in double overtime and the score knotted at 0-0, Tara Struiksma faced off against Vanguard’s goalkeeper Kaycee Smith. A penalty kick had been awarded to the Mustangs after freshman Lynnae George was brought to the ground by an aggressive foul from the Lions defense. \nStruiksma had yet to score a goal this season entering into Saturday’s match, but she bested Smith for the win, subsequently sending the Lady Mustangs’ bench into a frenzy. \nThe 22nd-ranked Lady Mustangs (6-6-1, 3-2 GSAC) upended the 12th-ranked Lions (9-2, 6-3) for TMC’s sixth victory of the season. Notably, Saturday’s win keeps the Mustangs undefeated on their home turf. \nLooking to build off Saturday’s impressive win, the Mustangs now prepare for a pair of away matches against Menlo College on Thursday and William Jessup on Saturday. \nWomen’s Volleyball \nTMC got back to its winning ways last week by beating Hope International in four sets (25-23, 25-22, 19-25, 25-15) on Tuesday in Fullerton and non-conference opponent Concordia (Mich.) to the tune of 3-1 (25-23, 25-12, 23-25, 25-17) on Friday at Bross Court. \nWith the wins, TMC’s 2015 record improved to 13-8 and 5-3 in conference play. \nTonight, the Mustangs will continue their GSAC hiatus by taking on West Coast Baptist at 7 p.m. \nFor more information about The Master’s College Athletic Department, visit www.masters.edu/athletics, or follow the Mustangs on Facebook at Facebook.com/TMCAthletics and Twitter and Instagram at @TMCAthletics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:34:45.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
