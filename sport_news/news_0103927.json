Herman said his task now is ensuring that his team understands it’s only that — a start.\n“We are built that way. The culture around here has been ingrained,” Herman said. “We have a bunch of older, senior leaders that understand they only give you your senior year once. They want to make sure they are not remembered as the team that won their first six games, and then X, Y, Z happened, and went to the so-and-so bowl.”\n \nFRIDAY’S GAME No. 18 Memphis 66, Tulsa 42: Paxton Lynch completed 32 of 44 passes for 447 yards and four touchdowns to help Memphis (7-0, 3-0 American Athletic Conference) defeat host Tulsa (3-4, 0-3) for its 14th consecutive victory.\nDane Evans passed for 421 yards and four touchdowns for Tulsa.\nWisconsin, Illiniois feature tough defenses It’s been a while since Wisconsin and Illinois met when the game meant this much to both teams.\nThe Badgers (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten) need a win in today’s game to stay within sight of Big Ten West-leading Iowa.

The Badgers are even better in scoring defense, giving up a slim 10.9 points per game. Only Alabama (35 points) and Nebraska (21) have managed more than 10 points on them.\n“The edge guys and their linebackers are so active,” interim Illinois coach Bill Cubit said. “They’ll find out what your protection is and they’ll find a way to get their best player on your worst player.”\nThe Illini spent the previous two seasons giving up big yards and a lot of points. But this season, they are ranked a solid 30th in the country in total defense at 332.5 yards per game. Illinois is giving up 19.7 points per game to rank 28th.\nIllinois has beaten Wisconsin just once in the past 10 meetings.\nCincinnati, Marshall agree to games Marshall and Cincinnati have agreed to renew their rivalry.\nThe schools 150 miles apart will meet twice beginning in 2017, when the Bearcats will play host. The Thundering Herd will play host in 2019.\nThe teams last met in 2008, when the Bearcats won 33-10 in Huntington, W.Va.
