We want it even more now. We’re excited to have another opportunity at it.” \nWittman and the Rams exuded that fire early and the Blue Devils could never extinguish it.

Corvallis striker Corinne Sanderson, one of the state’s top goal-scorers, pulled one back on a direct kick just outside the 18-yard box, but the Rams rarely seemed rattled. \nRather, Central’s precision possession game prevented Corvallis from making many attacks at all. Keeper Venton Arce needed to make just one save, while the Rams’ midfielders and forwards seemed to slice through the Corvallis defense at will. The Rams recorded assists on all five goals. \nJill Hardenbrook tacked on an early goal in the second half and Wittman notched her third late in the game, sending the Rams (10-0-1) into next week with a home semifinal match against Whitefish (10-3-1). \n“Corvallis didn’t really push us, but at the same time, our girls tried to work on what we wanted them to do,” Central coach Didier Ndidi said, shortly before he left the field to board a flight to Polson where he was to coach the Rams’ boys in their playoff match in Polson Saturday afternoon. “Even knowing that Corvallis wasn’t to our level, the girls didn’t give up our style and stayed calm.” \nCorvallis ended its season 4-8-1. Coach David Molesh was just glad his young roster – the Blue Devils have just three seniors – got to experience playoff soccer. \n“I don’t think people even expected us to make the playoffs, so having the opportunity to come play here, we’re super excited,” he said. “We’re getting there. I’m disappointed, but as happy as you can be with a loss.” Scoreboard: Class A soccer playoffs \nClass A soccer playoffs \nThe good news? Both of Didier Ndedi’s soccer teams at Billings Central have playoff games Saturday.
