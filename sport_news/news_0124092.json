This is not to be confused with the current CA XI that is a team made up of promising youngsters and is taking part in the Matador Cup.\nThe side that will take on the Black Caps in a two-day match at Manuka Oval contains a raft of men who are likely to don the baggy green at some stage this summer.\nWe look at several intriguing sub plots that will play out during the tour game.\nCA XI: Usman Khawaja (c), Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Cameron Bancroft, Adam Voges, Joe Burns, Sam Whiteman, Peter Siddle, Jason Behrendorf, Billy Stanlake, Ashton Agar, Ben Taylor (12th man)\nFOUR BATSMEN PLAYING FOR TWO POSITIONS\nWith Chris Rogers and Michael Clarke retired, there is a vacancy at the top of the order and at either first or second drop depending on where captain Steve Smith elects to bat.\nSo far four names have been thrown up for those two positions, with Shaun Marsh , Cameron Bancroft and Joe Burns all in contention for a spot alongside David Warner at the top of the order, and Usman Khawaja a chance of playing anywhere in the top four. Usman Khawaja and Joe Burns could be playing for the same spot in the Australia’s Test team.

His Warriors teammate Bancroft isn’t too far behind, with 335 runs at 67, but Queensland duo Burns and Khawaja haven’t fared quite as well, averaging 31.60 and 38.50 respectively.\nHAVE THE SELECTORS PICKED TOO STRONG A TEAM?\nIt’s rare for a touring side to get a chance to take on such a strong team in a warm-up match.\nLast summer, when India toured Australia, its arrival coincided with the start of the Sheffield Shield season so the two tour matches it had were against a young Cricket Australia Invitational XI that was captained by Ashton Turner and did not feature a single player with a Test cap to his name.\nAnd it’s not unusual for touring teams to face less than stellar opposition during warm-up matches.\nBefore the tour of Bangladesh was cancelled, Steve Smith’s men were pencilled in to take on a Bangladesh Cricket Board XI that featured no frontline spinners. And the country’s selectors made no secret of the fact that they had done so for tactical reasons. Fired up Shaun Marsh smashes 186 for the Western Warriors 0:54 Play video\nCricket: Shaun Marsh has a day to remember in the Matador Cup, slamming 186 runs on his way to becoming the highest run scorer for Western Australia in domestic one-day crickett\nFox Sports 15 Oct 2015 Sport/Cricket/Highlights “We are taking home advantage. Like any other touring side that comes to Bangladesh, we will make it challenging for Australia to play spin, which is our biggest area of strength,” selector Minhajul Abedin said.\nFacing a strong team may aid New Zealand’s preparations. At the same time, with selectors still facing plenty of questions over who to bring into a side going through a generational chance, it’s understandable that they have opted to use this match as a chance to take a closer look at the candidates.\nAnd if the CA XI has some success against the Kiwis, it could leave them with plenty of doubts in their minds heading into the Test series.\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ADAM VOGES AND MITCH MARSH\nAfter rediscovering his form towards the end of the Ashes and being named vice-captain in place of the injured David Warner for the doomed tour of Bangladesh, Adam Voges looked a certainty to play in the Gabba Test.\nSo too did Mitchell Marsh after starring in Australia’s win in the final Ashes Test as well as its ODI series triumph over England in September.\nSince then both have had a tough time in the Matador Cup, with Voges averaging 12.50 and Marsh 18.25 with the bat. In fairness to the latter, he has impressed with the ball, taking five wickets at an average of 25.80.\nSo is it a case of perform or beware for the pair? Or are selectors simply choosing to give two key players the chance to play as much red-ball cricket as possible before the first Test?\nIt’s worth bearing in mind the only Sheffield Shield round that takes place before the Gabba Test will be played with a pink ball. Adam Voges has had a tough Matador Cup.

Since then he has taken three wickets in three matches at an average of 47.00.\nThey aren’t the greatest numbers, but selectors saw enough in his impressive display against South Australia where he took 2-43 to give him the nod for Sunday’s game.\nStanlake has been clocked bowling speeds close to 145kph and has a big fan in Queensland teammate Chris Hartley.\n“You only have to look at Billy’s stature to realise he has huge potential,” Hartley told the Courier Mail.\n“When everything clicks he’s our quickest bowler and gets nice outswing on the ball.\n“The ingredients are there for him to be a very dangerous fast bowler. If everything keeps heading in the direction it’s been, he’s going to play a lot of first class cricket and beyond.’’ Queensland giant Billy Stanlake is one for the future.

I haven’t seen him bowl,” Lehmann said when asked about Siddle’s progress at Australia’s red-ball training camp last week. “Victoria have been nice. It has been good for them to play him, hasn’t it?\n“But that’s just the way it is. We can’t control what Victoria do.\n“It would be nice to see him play because we’ve got a Test match coming up. We’ll just have to wait and see.”\nLehmann will get his chance to take a closer look at Siddle over the weekend, with the 30-year-old a part of the Prime Minister’s XI for Friday’s one-dayer and the CA XI for the two-dayer starting on Sunday.\nWith Pat Cummins injured, James Pattinson still coming to terms with his remodelled bowling action and Josh Hazlewood only just returning to cricket after an extended rest, Siddle could be a dark horse for the third seamer’s spot alongside the left-handed Mitchells Starc and Johnson.\n Have Aussies just given the Kiwis a leg-up?", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/10/15/DVU_151015_CRI_S_MARSH_186_FOR_WA.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/20/1227575/582386-f935bb3c-76c6-11e5-8562-88a509acffad.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/20/1227575/581312-1b8091d0-76c7-11e5-8562-88a509acffad.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/20/1227575/581395-3f774106-76c7-11e5-8562-88a509acffad.jpg", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/ca-xi-v-new-zealand-burning-questions-after-squad-named-for-tour-match/story-fn2mcu3x-1227575583471"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:40:41.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
