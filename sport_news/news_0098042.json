(WGEM) -- The time has come for a two week stretch that will likely define Palmyra's regular season.The Panthers play Centralia this Friday and Brookfield next Friday. And they welcome the challenge.\"It's a real great privilege to just come out against a good team and fight. Hopefully we'll be ready and prepared,\" senior Matt Frankenbach said.\"This really prepares for you for the playoffs and the type of intensity that's going to be there.\"Through six games Palmyra's calling card has been its defense.Opponents have combined to score just 42 points.But they are about to face a Centralia offense as big and physical as they'll see all season.\"They put our offense in position to have success. We tend to sometimes put them in holes and they recover. They've done a good job of just getting after it every play,\" head coach Kevin Miles said of his team's defense.\"Centralia is one of the best programs consistently throughout the state and anytime you play them you're going to get a great football team that's fundamentally sound and physical.\"The Palmyra offense got past the struggles of a 16-point performance against South Shelby by putting up 96 points the last two games.Miles says better communication up front has played a key role in the resurgence.\"We may run the same play five times in a row and they may block it different ways all five times because it's going to depend on where the defense lines up,\" Miles said.\"It wasn't a concern for me ever that the offense was struggling. I know we'll figure it out when we need to and hopefully make some big plays this week.\"According to senior Travis Harvey, \"Basically (we need to) just get to our blocks and have a lot of fun. If we have our energy up we can do great things.\"Palmyra is in search of its third straight win in the series with Centralia and they are back home for only the third time this season.
