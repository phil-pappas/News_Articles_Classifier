They are woefully thin, and that might be an understatement. \nOf course, with Darrelle Revis in town today, the issue only becomes magnified. \nRevis has merely been sensational, helping the Jets earn the distinction of the league’s top-rated defense, while the Patriots have been skating by with Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler , Logan Ryan and a revolving door of second, third and fourth corners. \nHow much has Revis been missed? \nWell, while the assumption would be a lot, that wouldn’t be technically accurate, given the Patriots are unbeaten heading into today’s game against the Jets. \nWhen you can score points by the droves, as is the case with Tom Brady and the Patriots offense, cornerback play won’t necessarily kill you. In other words, you can get by without a shutdown corner. And thus far, playing with the lead, along with having creative game-planning, and the ability to still take away an opponent’s top weapon, has allowed the Pats to survive life without Revis. \nBut can they still win the big one without him? That’s the bigger question lurking ahead. \nIf the Patriots are able to land legitimate help before the Nov.3 trade deadline, that could change the dynamics — and the answer to a definitive yes. But right now the prospects of them facing a team with a legitimate quarterback or one with multiple weapons gives pause on a full green light. It’s closer to a yellow light. \n“Coming in, I didn’t think (they could survive without Revis), and I still believe, when you get up against the really good teams, it’s going to be tough,” NFL analyst Solomon Wilcots told the Herald. “Especially if you have a game where the score is real close, where you have to commit resources to stop the run, when they have to bring a safety down in the box to stop the run, now you’re more one-on-one on the outside.” \nThus far, that hasn’t been an issue. The Pats have handled the Steelers, but Ben Roethlisberger didn’t have top back Le’Veon Bell or receiver Martavis Bryant during the season-opening loss to the Pats. Bill Belichick & Co. handled the Cowboys, but they didn’t have to deal with quarterback Tony Romo or wide receiver Dez Bryant . They handled Andrew Luck and the Colts, and deserve credit for essentially shutting them down in the second half with nothing more than a late touchdown on the books. \n“What I’m seeing from them now, is they’re well-coached, and they’re smart,” Wilcots said of the Pats defense. “But ultimately, they’re going to run into a group that has multiple resources at wide receiver and a good running game.” \nThe Jets sort of fit that profile with Chris Ivory in the backfield, and Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker catching passes, but it’s more in line with the Bengals and Andy Dalton ’s talented crew — wideouts A.J. Green , Marvin Jones and Mohamed Sanu , tight end Tyler Eifert and running backs Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard . \n“The Bengals have multiple resources at the skill positions. That makes you get to your third and fourth corner. How good is your fourth corner?” Wilcots said. “A team like Cincinnati, a team like Green Bay, the Steelers, that’s where you run short, and typically it happens in a playoff game.” \nThird and fourth corner? \nLast week, safety Patrick Chung took on T.Y Hilton because he was the best option and best matchup. He actually performed well, limiting the explosive receiver when he was on him. Hilton finished with six catches for 74 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Pats, who had Revis, Brandon Browner and Kyle Arrington last year, are down in depth thanks in part to Tarell Brown (No. 2 on the depth chart) going on season-ending injured reserve. Veterans Bradley Fletcher and Robert McClain , signed as free agents in the offseason, didn’t perform well enough, so they were cut. \nThat’s left the Pats with a group that’s short on experience. \nButler (second year) and Ryan (third) are now the top corners, followed by undrafted rookie Justin Coleman and third-year player Rashaan Melvin , who was claimed off waivers Wednesday. \nSaid Wilcots: “They’ve been playing well together. Teams are making plays against them, but it’s hard to be a shutdown secondary the way the rules are and the way the game is played. But the fact they’re playing with a lead has helped. Making teams one-dimensional helps. With Devin McCourty , they just have a smart group. And Malcolm Butler has done really well. He’s their best corner. He contests every ball. He gives away nothing. His confidence is so good.” \nButler has been good, and hasn’t fallen off the deep end since his heroics in the Super Bowl. That said, he’s also given up a lot of plays. He doesn’t have Revis’ lockdown ability, as opposing quarterbacks have just a 32.8 passer rating against the Jets corner, which is second-lowest among NFL cornerbacks behind Carolina’s Josh Norman . \nStill, with Butler as the top guy, it hasn’t proven to be that much of a detriment. \nWith a relatively soft schedule, and no great quarterbacks in sight, and that includes a Peyton Manning who can no longer throw, the Pats should be able to get by during the regular season. In other words, not having Revis won’t hurt them. But as presently constituted, they’re going to run into trouble during the postseason especially if they have to face Roethlisberger again with a full complement of weapons, or if they run into Aaron Rodgers in the Super Bowl. \nIt’s still hard to put any stock in the Bengals doing anything in January, even if they fit the perfect prototype to beat the Patriots, but you never know. \nBottom line?The Pats don’t miss Revis now, even if they are depleted. January may be another story. \nPick your poison, foes \nWhat did the Colts do to effectively neutralize Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski for a half last week? \nFormer NFL coach and ESPN analyst Herm Edwards saw the Colts rush only three to start, and drop a defensive end into Gronk’s usual passing lane across the middle. Or, they’d bracket him with double coverage with a cornerback and linebacker if he was lined up out wide. \n“They were going to make sure he didn’t get the ball, but that only works so long,” Edwards told the Herald. “They were still making big plays. ( Julian ) Edelman and ( Danny ) Amendola started catching the ball and Brady didn’t force it at all. They just started catching those crossing routes.” \nWhen the Colts couldn’t stop Edelman and Amendola, they changed tactics, and Gronkowski emerged. \n“You get so concerned with one guy, then others are catching the ball. So you’re not stopping anything,” Edwards said. “So now, you decide to rush four, and guess what? Gronk comes open.” \nHe came open to the tune of three catches, 50 yards and a touchdown. ... \nSpeaking of the Colts, it keeps getting weirder in Indianapolis. Coach Chuck Pagano said he’s not paying attention to the noise, yet according to the Indy Star, he opened a press conference last week by talking about the botched fake punt against the Patriots. \n“As far as that play goes,” he said, “I categorically reject any criticism that has fallen on any of our players or coaches.” \nHe was then asked about all the criticism and attention that’s been on him since the first game given his lame-duck status. Pagano said he doesn’t worry about any of that. \n“They can’t eat ya,” Pagano told the Indy Star. “That’s my motto: They can’t eat ya.” \nWhatever that means. \nCampbell making soup \nFor one game anyway, interim coach Dan Campbell brought some life into a dead Dolphins team. The defense really came alive. Cameron Wake registered his first four sacks of the season in last Sunday’s 38-0 trouncing of the Titans. \nThe question is whether this is just a one game revival, or if the Dolphins have truly turned their season around. \nESPN analyst Damien Woody , who played with the former tight end in Detroit, believes Campbell has the right stuff. \n“He’s a very smart guy, and super intense as a player,” Woody told the Herald. “It seems like he’s brought that over as a head coach. It looks like his whole philosophy revolves around winning one on one battles and being more physical than the opponent. I know their win was just the Tennessee Titans, but any time you can beat a team like that on their field in this league, that’s saying something. The biggest thing for them is, can they continue it, or do they think they’ve arrived because they had one big win against the Titans?” \nBroncs eye prove-it time \nIt appears the 6-0 Broncos, who have a bye this week, don’t feel as if they’re getting the respect of an unbeaten team, or of a top-flight defense. They said they’ll prove their mettle in next week’s showdown with the Packers. \n“I don’t want to make it bigger than what it really is. I don’t want to minimize the situation, either. It’s a big-time game going against a big-time offense, Aaron Rodgers on ‘Sunday Night Football.’ It should be great,” linebacker Von Miller told the Denver Post. “It’s going to be a time where we can go out there and show everybody what the Broncos defense is all about. \n“I still don’t think that we’re getting all the love that we should get. Aqib ( Talib ) has two pick-sixes and three picks. DeMarcus ( Ware ) has 41⁄2 sacks and he missed the last (game and the second half at Oakland). There is just a whole bunch of stuff that we have on this defense. I feel like it’s a lot that everybody is getting to see. (When) we play Green Bay, ‘Sunday Night Football,’ prime time, we’ll be able to prove our point. It should be good.” \nDouglas in awe of Julio \nThe Titans’ Harry Douglas faces his old Falcons team today. During a conference call with the Atlanta media, he couldn’t say enough about former teammate and fell receiver Julio Jones . \n“I know how hard he works and how much he loves the game. He does everything in his power to be successful and help his team in any way possible,” Douglas said of Jones, who is second in the league with 49 catches for 638 yards. “That’s not just catching balls. That’s blocking, putting in time at the complex and in the weight room. Being able to play with him for all those years I did, I know his work ethic. I know he’s an unbelievable player. Like I said, he has a chance to be the greatest player to ever play this game.” More On:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:57:55.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
