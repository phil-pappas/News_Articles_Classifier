Photo by Tom Cruze/For The Signal \nHart versus Canyon had all the craziness you’d expect from a long-time rivalry, what with two successful onside kicks, a blocked punt returned for a touchdown and five TDs of longer than 50 yards. \nBut put simply, the Indians had running back Nelson James and quarterback Nick Moore. \nAnd did they ever deliver. \nJames ran for 244 yards and four touchdowns on 20 carries, and Moore threw for 318 yards and two scores to lift the Indians to a 52-28 win over the Cowboys at Canyon High on Friday night in the teams’ Foothill League opener. \nHart (5-1 overall, 1-0 Foothill) took a 24-7 lead to halftime behind one of James’ TDs and two passing strikes from Moore to Brock Williams. \nWilliams caught nine passes for 130 yards and two TDs in the game. \nMoore finished 24-for-36 with an interception. \nCanyon QB Miles Fallin went 13-for-31 for 306 yards and three TDs of 80, 13 and 72 yards, respectively. \nThe second of which went to Camden Apsay at the 8:32 mark in the third quarter to bring Canyon (1-5, 0-1) within 24-13. \nCowboy Cole Manclow blocked a Hart punt deep in Indians territory minutes later and Jason Preece recovered it and ran it in for a touchdown to make it 24-20 Hart. \nThen it was Hart’s turn for a frenzy. \nJames broke off a 65-yard touchdown run on Hart’s next play. \nThen after two more TD runs — a Moore 3-yard scamper and a James 10-yard score with a successful onside kick in between — James capped Hart’s night with a 73-yard scoring run up the right side to put the Indians up 52-20 with 7:28 to play. \nJake Gavin caught three passes for 112 yards and a TD to lead Canyon. \nHenry Arellano carried the ball 12 times for 45 yards. \nMoore ran 14 times for 26 yards, while Ethan Lazarek caught five passes for 106 yards for Hart, which showed no letdown after a strong preleague. \nThe Cowboys, coming off a brutal preleague schedule, stuck to what worked for them in the first half of their loss to St. Francis their last time out, keeping Fallin mostly under center and looking to move the ball with the run and short passes. \nBut the Hart defense proved too tough, limiting Canyon to 135 total yards in the first half. \nCanyon had beaten Hart four out of their last five meetings and eight of their last 12 coming into the game. \nThe loss was just Canyon head coach Rich Gutierrez’s second to the Indians in his tenure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:37:47.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
