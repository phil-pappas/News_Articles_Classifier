Unique, timeless and handcrafted in America, The Don leather fly fishing wallet is the perfect combination of modern utility and classic style.\nCedar Hills, Utah (PRWEB) October 08, 2015\nProvo River Fishing Company, LLC (“PRFC”) ( http://www.provoriverfishingcompany.com ), a startup co-founded by three brothers, launches a Kickstarter campaign this week ( http://kck.st/1WJGEM5 ) for The Don, a premium leather fly fishing wallet. Unique, timeless and handcrafted, The Don leather fly fishing wallet is the perfect combination of modern utility and classic style.\nThe Don's design was over a year in the making. PRFC worked through more than 15 protypes and spent months field testing before ultimately dialing in the final design – of which the company is beyond proud.\n“People love The Don and we want to make it more cost accessible for anyone who loves nothing more than a day out on the river, lake or ocean. We want everyone to own and enjoy this timeless heirloom fishing accessory,” says Steve Ranson one of the co-founders. The Kickstarter campaign seeks $12,500 to scale up the availability of The Don Fly Fishing Wallet.\nThe Don was inspired by the founders’ grandfather, Don Glover. Mr. Glover was an avid fisherman, adventurer, craftsman, entrepreneur, and WWII veteran who built both a business from the ground up and a cabin in the woods with his own two hands. “He never cut corners, assumed the best of everyone, and was always there for anyone in a pinch. So we named our fishing wallet after him, because that's what our products are all about,” added Steve.\nMade from premium vegetable tanned leather, each Don is hand cut, dyed, burnished, waxed and oiled for a water resistant finish. Each Don holds dozens of flies in a variety of sizes from small size 30 nymphs to large articulated streamers. The Don has two pockets, both measure 5 inches wide and 3 1/2 inches deep (13 x 9 cm) and will hold, for example, packs of leader, strike indicators or your fishing license. One pocket is fully lined with a heavy duty, outdoor rated, water resistant canvas. The second pocket is partially lined with the same material. The Don stays closed using strong epoxy coated magnets sewn into the wallet's interior. The Don is available in a variety of leather and stitching colors.\nOn Kickstarter: http://kck.st/1WJGEM5\nAbout Provo River Fly Fishing Company:\nFounded in 2015, PRFC was imagined in 2014 when the founders started using some of their grandfather’s vintage fishing equipment in the pursuit of a classic fly fishing experience.
