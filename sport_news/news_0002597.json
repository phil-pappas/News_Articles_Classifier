Gilas Pilipinas’ Calvin Abueva attacks the basket, splitting the defense of two Indian defenders in a FIBA game won by the Filipinos, 99-65. FIBA.com \nTerrence Romeo once again provided the spark the nationals needed, coming off the bench to score a team-high 20 points, to go with three rebounds and four assists to lead the Philippines’ balanced attack. \nThe nationals’ primary players did a lot of damage as well, with Andray Blatche finishing with 15 markers, Ranidel De Ocampo adding 13, and Jayson Castro and Calvin Abueva each scoring 12. \nWith the win, Smart Gilas ended the classification rounds compiling a 4-1 record to top Group E play. \nThe Philippines will face No. 4 seed Lebanon in the Group F knockout quarterfinals tomorrow. \nBut more importantly, finishing at the top of its group allowed Gilas to avoid Group F No. 1 China, a powerhouse squad, in both the quarters and semifinals. \nMark Pingris finally had his breakout game of the tournament, scoring 12 points and grabbing four rebounds. \nIt was actually a total domination by the Philippines as it pounded on the helpless Indians for the most part. \nUsing its stingy defense and in-sync offensive attack, Gilas had a relatively easy time against India. \nAlthough the game wasn’t broken wide open right away in the first half, Smart Gilas was still on control before it finally broke free in the third. \nThe Philippines outscored India, 23-14, in the third to take a commanding 65-50 advantage heading to the fourth. \nThe pounding continued in the last 12 minutes, where the cushion of Gilas just got bigger until the final bell.
