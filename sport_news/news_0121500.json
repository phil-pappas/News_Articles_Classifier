The failure to land the star power Phil Jackson was searching for, the coach missing practice while fighting a former teammate and even the nagging injury to Arron Afflalo have hardly made it a victory lap. \nFor a team that hasn’t had many victory laps — or victories — that makes the start to this season a crucial stretch. But a look at the schedule shows that is easier in theory than in practice. \nThe need to change the tone will take something special since the schedule starts difficult enough that Vegas oddsmakers put an over/under line on the first 15 games for the team — and the 4.5 number wasn’t exactly encouraging. \nBut the 4.5 might be encouraging as the brutal schedule leaves few games the Knicks can pencil in a likely win. Admittedly, a team that won 17 games all of last season has few games that seem like sure wins, but this is a difficult schedule for any team. \nThe Knicks start off in Milwaukee on Wednesday against a talented and rapidly improving squad — not to mention one aided by the addition of Greg Monroe, the free agent who was the first recruit on Jackson’s schedule this summer. They follow that by flying home for a game against Atlanta the next night. Then it’s off to Washington, back home for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs, and on the road in Cleveland — where the Cavs likely remember the Knicks’ upset in their home opener last year. \nThe Knicks host the Bucks and then finally, in their seventh game, face a team that has struggled like they have, the Lakers in a Sunday afternoon game at the Garden. Then it’s a back-to-back road set in Toronto and Charlotte, home games against Cleveland, New Orleans and Charlotte and finally a road trip through Oklahoma City, Houston and Miami — ending with the 16th game of the season in Orlando, a lesser squad, but hardly a pushover in the final game of a four-game road trip. \nIn those first 15 games the Knicks face eight teams that made the playoffs last season. And hardly anyone would think that the Thunder and Heat won’t be back in the playoffs this season after struggling with injuries in 2014-15. \nIf the Knicks can’t hold their head above water in this stretch the stench of last season, the questions about Jackson and Derek Fisher will linger and the specter of Isiah Thomas in the building will loom large. The simple way to avoid all of this is to win. Maybe not so simple. \nEmail: popper@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:06:54.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
