It already boasts a win over Virginia Tech and a near upset against No. 11 Florida. The Pirates have the tools to spoil BYU's homecoming, making for a great game. \nHere are six important numbers that could have an impact on the Pirates-Cougars matchup. 1,107 \nQuarterback Blake Kemp has already racked up 1,107 passing yards this season, and in the last few games, he hasn't even been ECU's main quarterback. Despite being the starter all season, he has been benched in favor of backup James Summers early in the last two games. 4 \nOutside linebacker Montese Overton was named the AAC's Defensive Player of the Week after tallying four sacks against SMU , a new conference record. BYU's offensive, which ranks second-to-last in the FBS in sacks allowed this season, may have one of its toughest tests of the year this weekend. 254 \nSummers has played less than six quarters in ECU's last two games, but he's racked up 254 rushing yards and four touchdowns in that span. No, they aren't Taysom vs. Texas numbers, but Summers is still a talented dual-threat quarterback who could be a headache for BYU's defense. 147 \nChris Hairston, ECU's leading rusher, has tallied only 147 total rushing yards against the Pirates' FBS opponents. BYU has given up big games to solid running backs this season, including Michigan's De'Veon Bell and UCLA 's Paul Perkins, but Hairston shouldn't pose too much of a challenge for the Cougs. 192 \nEast Carolina's defense ranks 95th in the FBS in rushing yards allowed, surrendering over 190 per game. With healthy running backs returning in BYU's backfield, BYU offensive coordinator Robert Anae should be excited to face ECU's front seven. 55 \nECU leads the FBS in third-down conversion percentage, capitalizing on 55 percent of its attempts. The Cougs have struggled at times this season to lock down and end opponents' drives, and the Pirates could exploit that. Email: bensonsamb@gmail.com ; Twitter: @sambbenson.
