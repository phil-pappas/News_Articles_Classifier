Seminole, like Jones, is 2-0 in district play, including a 40-21 triumph over Kingfisher last Friday night. Senior Dake Reese propelled Seminole’s 290-yard rushing attack with touchdown runs of 10, 10, 67 and 69 yards. Reese also caught a 16-yard scoring pass from Logan Long.

Jones upped its record to 6-0 with a 52-6 humbling of Little Axe. Like Seminole, Jones didn’t have a turnover while forcing four Little Axe miscues — three fumbles and an interception. Quarterback Brandon George of Jones posted scoring tosses of 69, 23 and 16 yards. He also had a 4-yard scoring run. Jones has permitted only 51 points in six games while netting 221.
