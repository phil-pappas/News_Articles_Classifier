With Frozen Four MVP Jon Gillies ahead of him in the Friar net, Ellis’ time to shine wasn’t on Friday or Saturday night, but every afternoon at practice. “Those were his games,’’ said coach Nate Leaman. “He was our hardest-working player last year. The guys on the team knew it.’’ It paid off last weekend on PC’s season-opening trip to Miami University. Backstopped by Ellis, a junior, the Friars came home from Ohio with a win and a tie and moved up to No. 2 in the national polls this week behind North Dakota. The defending national champs delivered a clear message: Even without Gillies, this is still a very dangerous team. “Nick was really good on Saturday,’’ said Friar assistant coach Kris Mayotte. “You could just see the confidence growing and, hearing the guys on the bench, their confidence in him growing. He made some saves, especially late in the third period, that were big-time saves.’’ It wasn’t the first time that Ellis has come through for the Friars. In a rare start, he blanked UNH, 1-0, on the road last November when Gillies was benched for a violation of team rules. While watching from the bench for so long might shake the confidence of some players, Ellis has a rock-solid belief in himself. “It was tough at times, but at the same time we were a really good team and it was good to be part of everything. Jon is a great goalie,’’ Ellis said of Gillies, who sent him a text wishing him good luck before last weekend. “I knew that Coach Leaman believed in me. I knew that I was going to get an opportunity at some point. You just have to believe in your abilities and how hard you’ve worked to get to that point,’’ he said. Mayotte, a former goalie who played for Leaman at Union College from 2003 to 2006, said he and Ellis talked after the team arrived in Ohio last week. “I told Nick, ‘I know everybody’s thinking that Providence is on the spot because we don’t have Jon Gillies anymore.’ I told him, ‘I’ve believed in you since you were 10 years old,’’’ said Mayotte. There’s an interesting backstory there. During his playing career, Mayotte worked summers as an instructor at The Goalie Academy in Sterling, Va. He noticed Ellis right away. Page 2 of 2 - “The first time I worked with the kid, I’m running the goalie session and he’s outworking me. I’m sweating buckets and need to get a drink and he’s like, ‘Hey, let’s go, what are you doing? We can’t waste time.’ Right from the get-go, he just had something. His work ethic set him apart. I remember he would get nosebleeds and he wouldn’t want to take a break. He was that intense,’’ said Mayotte. According to Ellis, Mayotte “was the guy that I kind of looked up to when he was in college. It’s pretty awesome to be working with him every day.’’ A finance major from Millersville, Md., Ellis played two seasons at the Pomfret School in Connecticut before moving on to Des Moines of the United States Hockey League. He talked to Union and New Hampshire before picking PC. Mayotte had nothing to do with recruiting Ellis at PC; he was a volunteer goalie coach at Cornell in 2011 when Ellis committed. As for who he admires in the pro game, “I think every goalie wants to be like (Montreal’s) Carey Price,’’ Ellis said. “I guess you’d say I’m a (Washington) Caps fan, but I’m really a fan of goaltending. When (Scott) Darling is playing, I want the Blackhawks to win. I want the Canadiens to win all the time now that (Michael) Condon is the backup. I trained with him a couple of summers ago. I’m a fan of goalies.’’ While Ellis earned first crack at the net this season, freshman Hayden Hawkey – a Montreal draft pick who is coming off knee surgery -- is expected to see his share of playing time, too. It wouldn’t be a surprise if the Friars went well into the season without a clear No. 1 netminder. But no matter how 2015-16 plays out for the Friars, the perseverance displayed by Ellis over the last two seasons will be an example for his teammates. “(If you’re one of) the guys out of the lineup, you’ve got to make a decision. Am I going to mope or am I going to get better?’’ said Leaman. “Some kids mope and their game goes backward. The culture you want to have is, work on your game to get better and when you get the opportunity, make the most of it.’’ Just like Ellis did last weekend. providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:57:24.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
