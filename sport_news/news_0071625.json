Granted a few of them caused the WR to come back to the ball forcing a PI but has there been any completions over 40+ yards? Also regarding the last drive on 2nd/3rd/4th down... 2nd down - Even if Quinn doesn't knock that down DJ gets stopped short. He had 3 defenders flying right at him if you watch the replay 3rd down - Fitz was clearly his first read but was doubled. As he identified Brown on the sideline pressure and stepped up pressure from the NT was in his face causing him to release it too quick and overthrowing it. 4th down - Quinn basically timed his jump perfectly causing Palmer to lead DJ too far down the middle and high. Quinn wouldn't have knocked it down but I think it affected the throw. Palmer seems to be perfect on touch throws but is more inaccurate on his quicker releases (excluding quick slants to John Brown). It's hard to hit a quick short throw in the middle of the field unless the OL creates a gap. I counted two major drops including Gresham's. Funny to hear the announcers say \"the usually sure-handed Jermaine Gresham\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:31:06.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
