Elena Construction and Development Corp. hopes to make an impact right on its first crack in the Spikers’ Turf as it slugs it out with Navy even as Air Force collides with Instituto Estetico Manila at the start of the Reinforced Conference.\nAces from former Champion Infinity squad make up the top realty and construction firm’s roster, including San Beda’s Sylvester Honrade, Perpetual Help’s Joven Camaganakan, St. Benilde’s Angelo Espiritu, La Salle’s Mark Lee, Michael Antonio and Al-Frazin Abdulwahab along with Rhenze Hu, Roland Tonquin, Anjo Banaga and Richard Gomez.\nBut they will be up against a Navy squad also out to gain early momentum in the season-ending conference of the country’s premier men’s volley tournament presented by PLDT Home Ultera and backed by Mikasa.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:46:21.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
