(AP) - Lawyers for a New York City woman who sued her 12-year-old nephew for injuring her while excitedly greeting her say Connecticut law forced her to go to court over her medical bills.\nA jury on Tuesday rejected Jennifer Connell's lawsuit seeking $127,000. She says she broke her wrist when the Westport, Connecticut, boy jumped into her arms at his eighth-birthday party, causing her to fall.\nConnell's law firm says her nephew's parents' insurance company offered her $1 and she had no choice but to sue to pay medical bills. They say she was never looking for money from him.\nPeter Kochenburger (KAHCH'-ehn-bur-gur) is an insurance law specialist at the University of Connecticut School of Law. He says state law typically requires those claiming injury to sue the individual responsible.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
