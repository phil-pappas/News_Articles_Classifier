Lincoln County State's Attorney Tom Wollman declined to confirm the name of the student, but expected charges to be filed within a day.\nAuthorities said Wednesday afternoon that the student pulled a gun following a dispute with the principal, but said they don't know what spurred the dispute.\nHarrisburg, about 10 miles south of Sioux Falls, has a population of about 5,000.\nSenior Aanna Okerlund, 18, said she was in college algebra when a classmates ran into the room to tell everyone he had seen a student near the principal's office with a gun.\nOkerlund said Lein came onto the intercom shortly afterward to tell students there was a school-wide lockdown. She said Lein later told students by intercom that he had been shot, \"but was fine.\"\n\"You could hear the franticness in his voice,\" she said. \"It's just so surreal.\"\nOkerlund said her classmates were crying and shaking in the corner of the classroom while they waited for news during the lockdown.\nNick Pohlmann, who lives just across the street and has a son who is a senior at the school, said he found out about the shooting through a friend who called him asking if his son was OK. Pohlmann said he immediately drove back to his home and ran over to the school to try to get some information.\n\"This is good ol' Harrisburg,\" Pohlmann said. \"This doesn't happen here.\"\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:36:16.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
