BolinArkansas News Bureau - ebolin@arkansasnews.com \nFAYETTEVILLE – During July’s Southeastern Conference Media Days general consensus was Arkansas-at-Tennessee was one of the five most intriguing games of the SEC schedule. The promising Volunteers were hot pick to finish near the top of the East. Arkansas were the same in the West. \nThe game is still as intriguing three months later, even if the reasons for the fascination have wildly changed. \nArkansas has lost three straight games. The team’s lone win came in Week One against Texas-El Paso. \nTennessee has squandered two double-digit fourth-quarter leads. It has wins over Western Carolina and Bowling Green. \nThe synchronicity between the two schools are eerie. Both struggle in the fourth quarter. Both have third-year head coaches. Both were trendy picks for 10-win seasons. None of the coincidences are lost on Arkansas coach Bret Bielema. \n“(Tennessee coach) Butch (Jones) is probably going through a lot of the same things we are,” Bielema said. “He’s got a young football team and Florida really took advantage … They are a team that’s searching for an identity, like we are.” \nSaturday’s winner will see a measure of fortune returned to those high preseason expectations. The loser will likely see its fan base – and perhaps others – on the edge of an all-out mutiny. \nFor the Razorbacks a win is almost necessary to keep bowl hopes alive. Football Championship Subdivision Tennessee-Martin would appear to be the last near-guarantee win on the schedule. Other general possibilities include home games against Auburn, Mississippi State and Missouri. But even wins against those four teams, and nary one this Saturday, would leave Arkansas with five total victories in 2015. That total is one short of last year’s regular season and one short of bowl eligibility this year. \nTennessee seemingly has more to lose. The SEC East isn’t as top-heavy as the West and the Volunteers remaining schedule is lighter than Arkansas’. Tennessee’s remaining opponents after Arkansas are a combined 16-12. The Razorbacks’ opposition, not including Tennessee-Martin, has five losses total. \nEven with three straight losses, Arkansas has improved each time. Coach Bret Bielema knows that’s irrelevant if the losses continue. But given the upward trend, Tennessee’s opposite direction and the two teams’ strengths and weaknesses, a Saturday win is a real possibility. \nArkansas is last in the SEC in pass defense, but Tennessee is 11th in passing. Tennessee’s rushing offense is third. Arkansas’ rushing defense is second. The Razorbacks are third in passing offense. Tennessee is 13th in defending it. \nBasically, everything at which Arkansas excels offensively, Tennessee side struggles with. And vice versa. And where the Razorbacks defense is good and bad, Tennessee’s offense is good and bad at the same thing. \nThere have been times when Arkansas has taken advantage of those superior qualities in the last four games. It’s those fourth-quarter bugaboos that persist. And, of course, Tennessee is in the same boat. \n“They know it’s tough and we know it’s tough when you can’t close-out games,” Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen said. “But the biggest thing we’re working on is us. And we’re working on anything we can do to to close-out games.” \nIt’s a good thing history isn’t prophecy as far Arkansas is concerned. And not only in regards to the struggles in the final 15 minutes of games. Arkansas has won exactly one time total in Knoxville. Razorbacks tight end coach Barry Lunney was the quarterback that year, 1992. \nClint Stoerner’s infamous fumble in 1998 was in Knoxville. Jason Witten’s sixth-overtime touchdown reception was there, too. And while current implications for this season aren’t as lofty as those then, they may be nearly as important for each program’s long-term future. \n“I get it,” Bielema said. “But when you play SEC, all of them matter, man. We both need a win. That’s what it is. That’s all that matters.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:05:09.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
