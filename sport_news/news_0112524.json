The impressive offensive display happened in nothing more than glimpses. The defense made some nice plays, too, but allowed far too many big plays. \nIn the end, the Lions finished with 274 total yards. They lost four yards — combined — on their first four possessions of the second half. And questions about debatable coaching and poor play again will be the main topic of discussion this week, though those talks will be in London where the Lions play next. \nMatthew Stafford finished 18 of 26 for 256 yards with two touchdowns, and he played through a left-hand injury in the second half, which surely happened on one of the Vikings’ several hard hits with unblocked rushers. \nBox score: Vikings 28, Lions 19 \nWide receiver Calvin Johnson added five catches for 86 yards and a touchdown, and tight end Eric Ebron had five catches for 89 yards and a touchdown. \nFor the Vikings (4-2), Adrian Peterson had 19 carries for 98 yards, most of which came on a 75-yarder in the third quarter. Rookie receiver Stefon Diggs added six catches for 108 yards and a touchdown, and quarterback Teddy Bridgewater was an efficient 25 of 35 for 316 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe Lions had some bright spots defensively — defensive linemen Ezekiel Ansah and Caraun Reid among them — but the Vikings’ 425 yards were just another sign that this unit isn’t anywhere close to last year’s imposing defense. \nIt looked so good for the Lions at the beginning of the game. Stafford started the game 6-for-6 for 119 yards with two touchdowns on the first two drives as the Lions opened a 14-3 lead. The team averaged 8.2 yards on its first five carries, too. \nBut after the first 14 minutes, the Lions offense couldn’t find its rhythm again, and the defense was consistently plagued by inconsistency, as has been the case for most of the season. \nWith the Lions up 14-3, the Vikings began chipping away at the lead. It started with a 53-yard field goal from Blair Walsh, which made it 14-6 with 11:11 left in the second quarter. \nThe Lions recovered a fumbled exchange between Bridgewater and turned that into a 52-yard field goal, taking a 17-6 lead with 5:03 left in the second quarter. \nOn the ensuing drive, the Vikings gained 49 yards on the second play after the Lions forgot to cover fullback Zach Line, an Oxford native who caught the short pass and easily ran down the field. Five plays later, Bridgewater threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph, though a missed extra point kept the Lions ahead 17-12 with 1:49 left in the half. \nThe Lions hoped to run a successful 2-minute drive to close the half, but a Vikings sack helped lead to a three-and-out. \nSure enough, the Vikings had little problem driving to more points. A holding penalty on the punt by Lions safety Don Carey gave Minnesota the ball at its 48-yard line, and as the second quarter ended, Walsh made a 51-yard field goal, making it 17-15. \nThen, the Vikings started with the ball in the third quarter. They started moving the ball well, but an apparent sack by Lions defensive end Jason Jones seemed to end the drive. Instead, holding on cornerback Quandre Diggs extended the possession. \nThree plays after the penalty, Bridgewater connected with Diggs for a 36-yard touchdown after he became wide open running a crisp route against cornerback Rashean Mathis. With 10:19 left in the third quarter, the Lions trailed for the first time, 22-17. \nThe Lions responded with a three-and-out that surprisingly didn’t include a sack. The Vikings opened the next drive with a 75-yard run by Peterson, but somehow, the defense held Minnesota to a 35-yard field goal, which increased the Lions’ deficit to 25-17 with 6:07 remaining in the third quarter. \nThe Lions’ next three-and-out included two sacks. And yet again, the Vikings turned their next drive into points, this time a 22-yard field goal from Walsh that made it 28-17 with 14:10 remaining. \nSurely, an 11-point lead wasn’t insurmountable as the Vikings had just proved while scoring 19 unanswered points. However, for the Lions, 11 points seemed impossible as the offensive line could hardly block the Vikings long enough for Stafford to corral snaps. \nThe Lions finally drove into Minnesota territory late in the fourth quarter, but after reaching the 1, two failed runs — one by George Winn, one by Michael Burton — and an incomplete pass resulted in a turnover on downs. \nMinnesota briefly ended the Lions misery as they gave the Lions a safety instead of punting, making it 28-19 with 59 seconds remaining. But down two possessions, the free points didn’t matter for a Lions team that will travel to London still at the bottom of the NFL standings. \njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:39:25.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
