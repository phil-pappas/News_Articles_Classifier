He says the crowd turned on the team and Richards. The move to fire Richards did not surprise Darr. \n\"The fans are definitely frustrated. They are booing out there. It's not good that that happens, but you know the fans, it's a way for them to hear their voice,” the R Bar Owner said. \nHockey fans watched on TVs at the R Bar while the Blue Jackets new head coach John Tortorella made his first appearance in Columbus. \n\"It'll be interesting to see Thursday night's game with Torts behind the bench. I think a lot of people will come out to watch that,” Darr said. \nSome fans say time will tell if Tortorella is the right guy for the job, but a change is needed and there’s still hope for their team. \n\"The Jackets have started off with a losing record for several years and have bounced back to the playoffs, so there's always hope,” Woods said. \n“Even if we're down, it's just seven battles. We have 75 battles to go. We can ride the ship still,” Pfeffer said. \nFans tell 10TV they still have hopes the Blue Jackets will make the playoffs. Others are curious to see how the team’s next game will play out against Minnesota Wild. ©2015 by 10TV.com. All rights reserved.
