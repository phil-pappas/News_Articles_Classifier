The Cardinals are an FCS opponent, and are just happy to be receiving a significant payout for the game. On the other sideline, Baylor has everything to lose. The Bears are currently ranked No. 4 in the country, and have to look like it to make up for their poor non-conference scheduling. If Baylor were to go into this game and win by less than 50 points in front of its home crowd, it would be considered a colossal disappointment.\nWhen Baylor has the ball?\nTo say the least, fireworks. Seth Russell has started one other game against an FCS opponent, and he played well to say the least. In last season's game against Northwestern State, Russell threw for 438 yards and six touchdowns...in the first half. Wide receiver KD Cannon also had a monster game, posting 223 yards and three touchdowns in the half after getting the start due to injuries. This year, Baylor has the full complement of wide receiver options available to the dynamic Russell. The Bears should also be dominant on the ground this season. Baylor posted 300 rushing yards on a nasty 8.1 yards per carry. That doesn't even include a breakaway 60-yard touchdown from Russell that was called back. Lamar will have its hands full.\nWhen Lamar has the ball?\nIt's hard to know at this point. Both of Lamar's quarterbacks who played against Bacone College were not on the roster last year. Coppell product and Stephen F. Austin transfer Joe Minden threw for 170 yards and three touchdowns in shortened action on Saturday. Backup Carson Earp added 91 yards and two touchdowns of his own. Of course, the game came against NAIA Bacone College, so it's hard to tell what any of this performance means. To say the least, Lamar will be tested against Baylor's defense. Defensive end Shawn Oakman and safety Orion Stewart will both be back in the lineup, so the Cardinals will have their work cut out for them.\nPrediction\nJust like last year's game against FCS opponent Northwestern State, Baylor makes quick work of the Lamar Cardinals. With Kendal Briles now the playcaller and offensive coordinator, the Bears are sure to take shots and connect downfield early in the game. Lamar's Minden and Earp are both talented players, and might take a couple shots downfield of their own. However, neither has the command or control of Lamar's offense to convert more than once or twice. When Lamar goes down early, it will potentially lead to mistakes and turnovers. Jarrett Stidham will make his home debut, and Briles will even get a chance to consider putting in Chris Johnson at quarterback, or even preferred walk-on Zack Bennema.\nScore: Baylor 73, Lamar 7\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-09-10T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:40:41.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
