(Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)\nChristmas cactus\nJust a reminder that it’s time to start triggering your Christmas cactus and poinsettias now if you want them showing off for the holidays! You need to provide 12 hours of total darkness and cooler temperatures for the next four, better six weeks. Put your treasures in a room that isn’t used or get used to covering the plants with a box each evening at the same time, then remember to uncover each morning. This dark-light process is what triggers these plants to set their flowers. It’s hard to believe it’s that time of year already but it’s true. “Triggering time” has arrived!\nI’ve written about the buying and storing of your bulbs. Now, I’ll teach planting. If you’ve had the inclination you’ve been roughing up and preparing the soil in the areas where you choose to plant.\nIf not, use a shovel and really turn and break up the soil. Working in some compost would always be a good thing to add some needed nutrients and the turning gets the soil oxygenated, too.\nNow I want you to really look at the bulbs. They all (except anemone corms) have a true top and bottom so you have to figure out which is which.\nUsually on the bottom you’ll find a circular pattern that might or not have wee roots protruding for ease of identification. Most bulb tops are pointy, too. Some just barely pointy like crocus but they do have a definite top.\nThe rule of thumb when planting a bulb is to be sure you bury it twice as deep as the bulb is tall. So a 3-inch-long daffodil bulb needs to be planted about 6 inches deep.\nAn inch-tall crocus, 2 inches deep. You get the picture. Always err on the deeper side of that equation as well.\nA bulb planted shallowly could suffer while wintering over. As you dig the holes to the proper depth consider going about ½ inch deeper and sprinkling in about a tablespoon of granular super phosphate, cover it with some soil and then set your bulbs, remembering: tops pointed up.\nAfter the bulbs are set, move the loose soil around the bulb, filling the hole, and tamp it down gently. You want the bulbs firmly but tenderly settled in their new homes.\nAfter your collection is planted, give the area a good drink of water. That’ll get rid of any air pockets from around the bulbs and convince them it’s time to root out. You’ll want to water the newly planted bulbs throughout the dormant months to keep them from drying out.\nPlanted in the ground, I’d suggest watering twice a month. If you plant in pots – and the rule of thumb for planting stays the same – they might need water as often as weekly. Remember that if it’s going to get really frosty, water beforehand. A wet planting is insulated and healthier.\nA dry planted area is a failed planted area. If you need something visual to remind you to water, consider planting pansies, violas, ornamental kale and dusty miller amongst the bulb planting. They won’t interfere with the bulbs and seeing all that above-ground color you’ll be more apt to remember to water.\nAnd having all that color that those annuals offer during the dormant months it’ll help keep away the doldrums. I’ll suggest too that you have your bulbs planted by the third weekend of this month.\nPlanted much later than that they could suffer by not having been able to settle in for winter.
