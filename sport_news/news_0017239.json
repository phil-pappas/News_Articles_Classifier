If use of the drug is climbing, for example, that also must factor into the picture because some of that use has negative personal and social consequences.\nAdvertisement Nationally, there is little doubt that pot use is on the upswing â€” and has been for much of this century as attitudes toward it have relaxed. Part of that shift no doubt is attributable to the mainstreaming of medical marijuana in many states (Colorado in 2000) and, more recently, campaigns legalizing recreational pot.\nJust this week the National Institutes of Health released a study saying the percentage of Americans who reported using marijuana over the previous 12 months doubled between 2001-02 and 2012-13. More disturbingly, \"3 in 10 people who use marijuana [are] meeting the criteria for addiction,\" according to George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\nThe federal government's National Survey on Drug Use and Health last year confirmed Colorado was part of the upward trend.\nIn 2013, the Justice Department indicated its priorities in terms of the sale of marijuana included preventing distribution to minors; preventing revenue from going to gangs or cartels; preventing the diversion of marijuana to other states; and preventing drugged driving.\nThe data on some of these goals are murky. On the one hand, pot shops appear to have been mostly conscientious about not selling to minors, and the 2013 Healthy Kids Colorado survey showed a slight (statistically insignificant) drop in the percentage of high school students reporting they'd ever tried marijuana compared to 2011. But that upbeat finding is undercut by the testimony of school resource officers who report an increase in student use and by a rise in drug-related expulsions.\nColorado Public Radio reports that marijuana-related DUIs \"have fallen slightly across Colorado this year, according to the State Patrol.\" Alcohol continues to be responsible for five times as many DUIs.\nNevertheless, as the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area task force pointed out in a September report, the number of fatal accidents with drivers who tested positive for marijuana has climbed.\nThe task force is passionately opposed to legalization, and its latest report includes some sobering statistics. Nevertheless, we would argue that the worst scenarios predicted after legalization have not materialized. Meanwhile, smart regulations have been put in place, and are being refined as loopholes or weaknesses become apparent.\nAs the recent news reports make clear, the economic benefits of legalization seem to be real. Still, we will need several more years of data before it will be safe to say the social impacts are relatively modest and not of urgent concern.\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "external_links": ["https://www.cpr.org/news/newsbeat/pot-duis-fall-statewide-tick-denver", "http://www.rmhidta.org/html/2015%20FINAL%20LEGALIZATION%20OF%20MARIJUANA%20IN%20COLORADO%20THE%20IMPACT%204.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:03:10.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
