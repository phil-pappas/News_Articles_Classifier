(AP) - Ferrets and fish are among the pets being invited to participate in the Episcopal Church's annual Blessing of the Animals in New Hampshire.\nSeveral Episcopal churches around the state will offer special sermons and the blessings on Sunday, the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi, known as an advocate for the poor and friend to animals.\nAt White Park in Concord, there also will be music, activities and treats. The Revs. Kate Atkinson of St. Paul's Church and Jason Wells of Grace Episcopal Church will bless dogs, cats and other critters, including goats, chickens and rabbits.
