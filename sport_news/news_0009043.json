They are facts. \n\"I want luxury players in my team. I like creative players, and players who do different things. It's easy to say certain players are luxuries, especially when you've lost a game. When you lose, a certain kind of player -- the creative players -- always get the blame.\" \nMata -- who has been operating predominantly in a wide-right position this season under Louis van Gaal -- said that he was not given an explanation for his Chelsea exit, but is grateful for his time at Stamford Bridge and is targeting future silverware with United. \n\"I've not tried to prove anyone wrong,\" he added. \"I didn't speak with Mourinho like he has spoken with you, for example. I never had any explanations and didn't ask for them. \n\"But what is past is past. I will always be very grateful to Chelsea for everything they did for me, but I had a chance to join a great club and am enjoying it here. \n\"I've got a good record with goals and assists and hopefully we can reach a point where we win trophies, which is what I did at Chelsea.\" \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
