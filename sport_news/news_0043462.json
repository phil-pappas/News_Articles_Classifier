His proposals — appointing an ombudsman, independent audit of state associations’ accounts, putting the board’s balance sheet on its website — are perhaps the boldest steps ever taken by the BCCI towards making the board accountable and transparent. Until now, everyone’s focus had been entirely on the BCCI, with its constituent state units escaping the attention and censure. Relatively speaking, the parent body is far more transparent and accountable than its constituent units in terms of elections and finances. The state units, or a majority of them, are run pretty much like personal fiefdoms, with the same individuals running the show for decades and, in some cases, their sons taking over after them. The Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association, for example, reflects the ills afflicting the state units — it’s in the middle of a bitter factional war following the removal of Farooq Abdullah, who was its president for 35 long years, in the elections in July. (Abdullah has challenged it in the court). Also, the unit is embroiled in a financial scam. While the new BCCI president seems serious in making the state units accountable as far as their finances are concerned (each state unit gets Rs 25-35 crore from the BCCI every year), there was no indication/announcement by him on Sunday to suggest that he sees any problem in an individual staying in power for almost a lifetime. For the record, his own family has been an integral part of the Vidarbha Cricket Association for a long time. VR Manohar, Shashank’s father, is a former VCA president; Shashank became the president in 1996 and now his son, Adwait Manohar, is a vice-president in the association. Elsewhere, Niranjan Shah (Saurashtra Cricket Association), IS Bindra (Punjab Cricket Association), Jagmohan Dalmiya (Cricket Association of Bengal) Ranbir Singh Mahendra (Haryana Cricket Association), to name a few, had a long innings, running into decades, at the top in their states. The officials could say that their associations hold regular elections. Yet, despite the election, the incumbent office-bearers continue to hold on to their posts for as long as, well, the monarchs and dictators used to. “There must be something wrong somewhere. The purpose of elections isn’t just to elect individuals; an equally important function is to bring about a change, to ensure one person or a group doesn’t stay on forever. And when there’s no change for decades, there’s definitely something wrong,” said a cricket administrator, who didn’t want to be named. In some cases, proxies, friends and family as life members are used in many associations to ensure electoral longevity. Incidentally, the BCCI is aware of the inherent good in change. That understating is reflected in the cap it has placed on the terms and tenures of its principal office-bearers — an individual can’t be the BCCI president for more than two terms of three years each. So why similar restrictions can’t be put on the terms and tenures of the office-bearers at the state level? Or, going further down, even at the district level where, at many places, even the pretence of holding elections isn’t maintained. At this level, the secretary is the king — he’s runs the association, runs personal academies, and selects the teams all by himself. It will be difficult to find a more blatant example of a conflict of interest. “I had paid a hefty amount to become a life-member at one of the district associations more than a decade back. I can’t recall, save for one instance, when elections were held. It’s a completely one-man show in the districts,” said another individual involved with cricket administration. A few of the long-serving administrators have done a remarkable job for their associations and the BCCI. Yet, it would be better if the individuals move on after playing their innings and let the next person take guard. In this context, it’s fitting to Quote: what US president Barrack Obama told the long-entrenched leaders of the African nations a few months back. “No one should be president for life. Your country is better off if you have new blood and ideas… I know somebody with new energy and new insights will be good for my country, it will be good for your country too.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:16:47.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
