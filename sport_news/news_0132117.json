On Saturday, those two will meet again.\nThe game will mark the opening of Big South-play for both sides as the conference schedule gets going for the league. Below, we present three things to watch for when the Hawks travel south to take on the Bucs.\nThe noon kickoff will be broadcast on ShoreSportsNetwork, 1160 AM and 1310 AM. Matt Harmon (play-by-play) and Eddy Occhipinti (color) have the call.\n1. Stop the run: Stopping the Bucs rushing attack is a tall order, but Monmouth would be well-served to at least slow down a Charleston Southern team that employs the option and is averaging 272.3 yards per game on the ground. That ranks the Bucs seventh nationally among 123 Football Championship Subdivision teams and second in the seven-team Big South (Kennesaw State, 324.0 yards per game). The Hawks have fared well against the run, yielding 128.2 rushing yards per game, which is 27th nationally and fourth in the Big South.\n2. Lavon Chaney vs. the Charleston Southern defense: Monmouth’s junior running back got untracked last week against Bryant, rushing for a career-high 140 yards as part of 170 all-purpose yards in a 31-24 win. Off that game, Chaney and the Monmouth offense now face a Bucs team which is 19th nationally and second in the Big South against the run at 118.5 yards per game. Charleston Southern’s defense has been very strong all told, giving up an average of just 290 yards per game, which is 10th nationally and third in the Big South.\n3. Cody Williams is on record-pace: The redshirt freshman quarterback is second in the Big South with 239.6 yards of offense per game and third in the conference 199 passing yards per contest. Both statistics have him on pace for Big South freshman records. No Big South freshman quarterback has ever averaged 200 yards of offense per game, while freshman record for passing yards per game is 188.3, set by Johnathan Wilson of VMI in 2003. Williams is coming off a productive effort against Bryant, going 19-for-31 for 210 yards and two touchdowns, including a 50-yard score to classmate Reggie White Jr. with 1:16 to play. That broke a 24-all tie and capped the scoring.\nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman4@gannettnj.com\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RxvZB6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:27:52.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
