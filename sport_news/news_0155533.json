He has not been accused of wrongdoing.\nPlatini was questioned by Swiss investigators last Friday about a payment of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) he received from FIFA in 2011 for work carried out up to 2002.\nBlatter is being investigated as a suspect, while Platini is being treated \"between a witness and an accused person,'' according to Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber.\nPlatini said he only requested payment in 2011 because, when he took the job as a Blatter adviser in 1998, FIFA's \"financial situation'' meant he could not be paid the \"totality'' of his salary. The case could center on what was detailed in a written contract.\nPlatini has faced scrutiny from across Europe about the explanation for the transaction since writing to national associations on Monday.\n\"What Platini has let us know so far just isn't enough,'' German football league president Reinhard Rauball told Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.\nBlatter has vowed to remain FIFA leader until February despite being under investigation, but Rauball said he should go \"at the earliest available opportunity.''\nThe 79-year-old Blatter's column in FIFA's weekly in-house magazine is being published as usual on Friday. FIFA says it will call for the \"adoption of quota for women on decision-making bodies.''\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:43:51.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
