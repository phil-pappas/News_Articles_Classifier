Florida-Georgia played their annual rivalry game at EverBank Field, on Saturday, November 1, 2014 in Jacksonville, Florida, with Florida upsetting Georgia 38-20. \nWith three weeks remaining before the annual Georgia-Florida football game at EverBank Field, there’s potentially heightened anticipation for the 82,000-plus spectators and a national television audience because an SEC Eastern Division title could be at stake. \nBut an equally big story in the next month — with huge future economic implications for Jacksonville and those committed to preserving the game’s rich history — will take place away from the TV cameras and behind closed doors: renegotiating a Georgia-Florida contract that expires after the 2016 game. \nWhile these negotiations are often viewed as a foregone conclusion — Jacksonville has been the series host since 1933 (except 1994-95 when the stadium was rebuilt to accommodate the NFL expansion Jaguars) — it’s possible things could get a little dicey this time around. \nBoth universities and the city of Jacksonville aren’t prepared yet to start negotiations because they’re waiting to see the Jaguars’ plans for renovations to the EverBank club seat areas in the east and west stands, a place normally reserved for the wealthiest boosters of each school. \nThose renovations are expected to reduce the club seat capacity for Jaguars games in 2016 from 11,000 to around 8,000, which team president Mark Lamping says will improve the game-day experience and be a more appropriate number for the city’s NFL market size. \nBut as it pertains to the Georgia-Florida game, two possible sticking points for the schools must be ironed out. The first is replacing an estimated 3,000 club seats so that stadium capacity for the SEC showdown is back up to 82,917, as mandated in the contract. Another issue is how those temporary replacement seats, both in terms of comfort and aesthetic feel of the surroundings, will be received by the school’s top-level donors. \nSeveral people involved with upcoming and past negotiations agree that replacing club seats in the east-west stands, as opposed to replacing seats in the north end zone in last year’s renovations, presents a unique challenge because it involves seating for the highest-paying school boosters. \nOthers believe the contract renegotiation will go smoothly because all parties have the same objective: keeping the game in Jacksonville. \nSam Mousa, the city’s chief administrative officer, and Jacksonville CFO Mike Weinstein — both part of Mayor Lenny Curry’s Georgia-Florida contract negotiation team, along with sports and entertainment officer Dave Herrell — have been at this bargaining table before. They were involved with game negotiations in the early 1990s under Mayor Ed Austin. \n“I don’t see this as a bigger challenge because of the club seat issue,” said Mousa. “Every [Georgia-Florida] negotiation is dynamic and fluid. If it’s not seats, it could be anything.” \n“There’s going to be a dozen give-and-takes that’ll be part of the deal, whether it’s parking or some type of compensation,” added Weinstein. “We’re not focusing on one thing.” \nBut one thing abundantly clear is everyone part of these negotiations wants to see this game, which sparked a $33.3 million economic impact last year, according to analysis by Visit Jacksonville, stay permanently on the First Coast. \nCurry, a huge football fan and a former player at Middleburg High School, is convinced the city will work through any potential glitches to get a contract extension done. \n“The goal is to have all satisfied parties with a tradition that continues,” said Curry, who is hoping for a 10-year extension. “In any negotiation, and I’ve been negotiating my whole life in business, there’s absolutely a way to get people walking away from a negotiation where everybody gets a win. It’s just going to take teamwork.” \nTHE WAITING GAME \nOne of the reasons there’s more anxiety than usual about executing this contract extension, besides the club-seat renovation issue, is timing. Compared to the last two extensions, signed about a year before the contract expired — Sept. 1, 2010, and Oct. 25, 2005 — this one is almost certain to go into November or later. \nGeorgia athletic director Greg McGarity and Florida AD Jeremy Foley, who have been involved with this game in some capacity (McGarity worked in the UF athletic department for 18 years) since 1982, are trying to remain calm about the stadium modifications and the extension being in limbo. \nThere’s clearly uneasiness about already being in mid-October and not having a definitive date for negotiations, which Foley says the parties are coordinating now. And there’ll be no starting point for negotiating until the schools see the Jaguars’ plans for how the stadium will look for the 2016 game and beyond. \n“We need to see something soon because you can’t turn something around in 24 hours,” said McGarity. “It’s difficult to respond when you haven’t seen anything. That needs to happen pretty quickly. I don’t want to go into the last year of it [without an extension]. \n“Usually contracts are negotiated or reviewed a lot sooner than this, probably with a couple years left. If you want a long-term relationship with a coach, do you deal with it when he’s going into the last year [of his contract]?” \nFoley, who has more experience dealing with Georgia-Florida contract negotiations than just about anyone, is taking a wait-and-see approach toward the delays and stadium changes. \n“The city of Jacksonville has always been fair to the University of Florida,” said Foley. “What the stadium is going to look like [in 2016], what the process is going to be, I don’t know right now. I have total confidence in the mayor, and the Jaguars have made it clear they want to be good partners. \n“That’s a good-faith conversation. Once I know more, then I’ll be able to say, ‘this is good’ or ‘this is not good,” or ‘We wish it could be this way.’ It’s too early for that right now.” \nPart of the frustration for the delay has to do with what several people, including Curry, believe was a disconnect between the two schools and the city during the administration of former mayor Alvin Brown. \nCurry, who took office on July 1 and has spent the vast majority of time dealing with budget issues, became visibly agitated when asked about the Georgia-Florida negotiating process not being further along. He left messages with both McGarity and Foley the day after he got elected to assure them their game and getting an extension was a big priority. \n“How do I say this?” Curry said. “We’re moving fast, working long hours [on the budget]. We’re committing to getting it done with both universities. The previous administration absolutely left us with a lot of things that not only were not completed, many of them didn’t even get started, this [Georgia-Florida] being a very important one.” \nJacksonville Sports Council president Rick Catlett, whose organization runs the TaxSlayer Bowl and who was involved with the Georgia-Florida game operations while working for two different mayors in the 1980s, said: “I clearly believe over the last four years, the city has done a horrible job in communications and relationships with the two universities. But I’m confident the Curry administration will get this deal done. It shouldn’t be this hard.” \nCatlett knows this might annoy some city employees, but he believes the future of the Georgia-Florida game would be better served by turning the game-day operations and year-round communication with the schools over to his organization. He and McGarity were particularly miffed about last year’s game-day fiasco at Gate 2, where security took too long to process fans into the stadium, resulting in many not being seated until well after the game started. \n“The reason the Sports Council was created, and I believe the two schools want this to happen, is that somebody wakes up every morning worrying about how to make all this work,” said Catlett. “I would hope that the city would take a hard look at turning the operations and relationships on this game over to the Sports Council.” \nIn every Georgia-Florida contract negotiation, both sides bring their own list of demands/wishes and make concessions as talks move along. Curry, who is hoping for a 10-year extension, remains adamant that if another contract negotiation happens on his watch, he will start the process much sooner. \n“We’re not going to get stuck next time it’s up for renegotiation where it’s this late in the game,” he said. \nJAGS EASING CONCERNS \nNobody is more confident of the Jaguars’ club seat upgrade plans being an advantage, rather than an impediment, to a Georgia-Florida contract extension than team president Mark Lamping. \nSince coming aboard in 2012, shortly after owner Shad Khan took over the franchise, Lamping has taken a keen interest in making sure the Jaguars embrace the Georgia-Florida game as a partnership venture. He has made it a point to establish relationships with the two schools, and remains convinced McGarity and Foley will be happy with club seat changes. \n“It’s not just the seats, it’s also updating the clubs, making sure you have clubs where the air conditioning works, that the food service infrastructure is better,” Lamping said. “All of that comes with this. \n“The only questions Greg [McGarity] and Jeremy [Foley] would have is what does it do to the seating capacity, and if temporary seats are going to be involved, what type of seats are they and what will that experience be? And we don’t want that to be a poor experience.” \nThough Lamping has no involvement in the contract negotiations, his influence and ability to calm the waters about club seat changes could make talks between the city and schools go smoother. \nHe refutes any perception that, because the Jaguars’ next planned stadium upgrades are happening in the most expensive seats, it could pose problems for the Georgia-Florida game. Lamping expects when he shows each school the new stadium design by the architectural firm Populous, it will alleviate concerns. \n“What we have to do is be responsible in how we modernize EverBank Field, to make sure it’s sensitive to the needs of both universities,” said Lamping. “We’re doing this to make it a better stadium because if we don’t, our [Jaguars] future is threatened. \n“What’s going to change for the [Georgia-Florida] game is a certain number of seats will go from being a fixed seat to a high-end temporary seat. You have to make sure it’s a very comparable experience to what everybody else has, that’s the key. In club seats, you do it differently than what you do in the end zone. If temporary seats are brought in, they have to be the type that support what people are paying for it.” \nIt’s likely the Jaguars and Populous will present different options on replacement club seats for Georgia-Florida, possibly impacting the sticky issue of capacity, which the schools are fixated on keeping at 82,917. \nMousa hinted that everything is negotiable, that maybe Georgia and Florida would be willing to accept extra compensation — beyond the $3 million each receive for playing the game in Jacksonville — in lieu of losing some club seats. \nBut McGarity shot down that idea in an email, saying: “Priority number one is number of seats [being 82,917], no doubt about that. If we wanted more revenue, we would simply raise ticket prices.” \nHerrell concedes that if the schools feel strongly about keeping the capacity as it now exists, then “that’s what we’ll deliver.” \nSince the Jaguars became EverBank’s primary tenant in 1995, they’ve had their share of tense negotiations with the city. Lamping says he expects the proposed $25 million worth of club seat upgrades for next season will be divided between the team and the city, just as the $63 million scoreboard/video boards were in 2014 (the city paid $43 million, Khan paid $20 million). \nAnother issue is the costs of replacing those club seats for the Georgia-Florida game, then removing them for the remainder of Jaguars’ home games. The city absorbed that expense ($1.2 million) for the north end zone upgrades, but it’s uncertain who will foot the bill in this next round of proposed changes. \n“I think the city is going to come back to the Jaguars to be part of paying the costs for replacing those seats,” said Catlett. \nThat will be decided at the negotiating table — just another hurdle the city expects to successfully navigate in what may be the most intriguing Georgia-Florida contract extension talks in history. \n“We know we’ll get there,” said Mousa. “Contracts can be negotiated in four days or 40 days. We’ve got this under control. We’re not losing the Florida-Georgia game. We want to ensure it stays here for a long time.” \nA CHANGING LANDSCAPE \nWhile Georgia and Florida are intent on keeping one of college football’s greatest neutral-site rivalries in Jacksonville, the game’s gatekeepers understand that new stadiums will make it more difficult in the future to maintain long-standing traditions. \nOne of those venues is Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which will replace the Georgia Dome as the Atlanta Falcons’ home field in 2017. With a seating capacity of 75,000, and the potential to expand to 83,000, the $1.2 billion stadium has already sent a message to the college football world that it intends to be a major player for sporting events. \nMcGarity says maintaining the Georgia-Florida game tradition in Jacksonville is important, but he acknowledges the new Atlanta venue — along with AT&T Stadium in Dallas and a newly renovated Citrus Bowl in Orlando — cannot be ignored as potential competition down the road for any neutral-site game. \n“There are newer and more modern options available now that are in play [to attract neutral-site games],” said McGarity. “They’re business people, too.” \nCatlett, a Jacksonville native who has been attending the Georgia-Florida game for six decades, believes it’s more important than ever to not take for granted that Georgia-Florida will always be in Jacksonville. \n“[Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium] is a competitive threat,” said Catlett. “There are competitors that’d like to get their hands on our assets.’’ \nWith new or rebuilt stadiums popping up all over, those wanting to preserve the Georgia-Florida tradition in Jacksonville make it clear that another threat is apathy. Cities have to pay attention to the changing college football landscape, not take the events they have for granted. \nIn Jacksonville’s case, it benefitted greatly from the arrival of the NFL expansion Jagaurs in 1995, which forced the city to do a $200 million upgrade of the old Gator Bowl. \n“There’s no question it would have been an interesting dynamic to see what would have happened [to the Georgia-Florida game] if the NFL hadn’t come to Jacksonville,” said McGarity. “It’d be almost like what happened to Birmingham. The SEC Championship left [for Atlanta], and how much upgrading are you going to do with two events a year? \n“Look at a snapshot of what happened to Legion Field [in Birmingham]. Would that have happened to the Gator Bowl? With an NFL team, there have been significant improvements. People are accustomed to being in 75,000-seat stadiums now with a lot of bells and whistles.” \nLamping says he and Khan, despite the Jaguars being their top priority, want to do everything possible to make sure Georgia-Florida stays put. \n“We have to embrace this event and make sure everybody understands the [Georgia-Florida] game is in Jacksonville because this is the only place that’s going to give it this amount of love and attention,” Lamping said. “But we have to deliver on that love and attention for the universities. It can’t be just talk.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:44:45.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
