Courtesy Grant PUD i Order Reprint of this Story \nTwo of the workers injured at an explosion Thursday at Priest Rapids Dam are in critical condition at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. \nThree other workers taken to Harborview are in satisfactory condition. All five are being treated for burns, according to the Grant Public Utility District. \nA sixth worker has been released from the hospital. \nAll are plant electricians and operators. Their names and other identifying details are not being released by Grant PUD. \nThe explosion at about 4:15 p.m. Thursday was the result of the failure of electrical equipment, Grant PUD said Friday. The equipment was in one of the 10 generating units at the dam near Desert Aire on the Columbia River upstream from Hanford. \nThe dam remains in stable operating condition. There are no public safety issues, including no downstream flooding, according to the Grant PUD. \n“This is a difficult day for everyone here at Grant PUD. We are all concerned for our co-workers who were injured yesterday and are doing everything we can to show them our support in this difficult time,” said PUD acting manager Kevin Nordt, in a statement. \n“Our primary focus will continue to be taking care of our people,” he said. \nInvestigators from Labor and Industries will be at the dam Friday to evaluate events leading up to and causing the incident. Results of the investigation will likely take weeks, according to Grant PUD. \nThis story will be updated as new information becomes available.
