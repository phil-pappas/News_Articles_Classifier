Chicago also beat the Islanders 3-2 in overtime on Friday night, spoiling their Brooklyn debut.\nKane, who has three goals and three assists in Chicago’s first three games, is the subject of a sexual assault investigation in western New York. He hasn’t been charged, and has said he expects to be exonerated.\nScott Darling made 28 saves for the reigning Stanley Cup champions in his first start of the season. He was working on a shutout before Cal Clutterbuck got a short-handed goal with 1:05 left in the third.\nJean-Francois Berube had 30 stops for New York in his NHL debut. No. 1 goalie Jaroslav Halak remains out with an upper-body injury, and the 24-year-old Berube was claimed off waivers from the Kings last Tuesday.\nKane, who had two goals in the victory at Brooklyn on Friday night, assisted on van Riemsdyk’s opening score in the first period, and set up Panarin at 5:53 of the second. Kane then tipped a pass from van Riemsdyk by Berube for a 3-0 lead.\nChicago defenseman Brent Seabrook added a 5-on-3 power-play goal late in the third period. It was his first of the season.\nDarling, from suburban Lemont, Illinois, got the start after No. 1 goalie Corey Crawford played in each of the Blackhawks’ first two games.\nChicago jumped in front when van Riemsdyk glided down the slot and backhanded in a loose puck at 4:07 of the first. Kane set up the chance with a wrist shot from just inside the blue line.\nAnd there was no question about this goal for van Riemsdyk.\nIt looked as if the defenseman had his first NHL goal last season in a 5-2 win over San Jose on Nov. 9, 2014. But the league ruled the next day that van Riemsdyk’s slap shot had been deflected in by teammate Kris Versteeg.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under cal clutterback ,  new york islanders ,  patrick kane", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:11:11.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
