A win by North Florida will guarantee their third-straight appearance in the Atlantic Sun Conference Playoffs. The Ospreys have reached the tournament final in each of the last two seasons. Unblemished: Through two games this season, North Florida remains just one of two teams (FGCU) without a conference loss. It marks the first time since the 2008 season that the Ospreys are undefeated through the first two league contests. In 2008 the Ospreys defeated ETSU, 2-1 in overtime and then USC Upstate, 3-0 to begin their conference slate. Kyle Nasta was a huge reason the Ospreys earned a draw last week against FGCU by tying a season-high with five saves. He now has 133 career saves which is just five shy of tying the program's D-1 era mark of 138 set by Brad Sienkiewicz. Add to the Ranks: FGCU was added to the TopDrawer National Top 25 poll earlier this week coming in at No. 22. It marks the Ospreys' fifth opponent (others include: UNC, UNC Wilmington, USF & Elon) that has appeared in a Top 25 poll this year. In the latest NCAA RPI rankings, the Ospreys climbed to No. 42, second only to FGCU in the Atlantic Sun Conference. Top vs. Bottom: Saturday's match will feature two teams on the opposite side of the offensive spectrum. The Ospreys are second in the league with 19 goals compared to the Hatters who have just 12 goals in 12 games played, the lowest total in the A-Sun. About Stetson: The majority of the Hatter offense has come from Lucas Diniz who is credited for nine of the 12 Hatter goals this season. Diniz ranks second to USC Upstate's Gordon Wild who has an astounding 14 in 11 games played. Stetson is fighting for their playoff lives and are in the midst of a four-game road swing that concludes next weekend at Upstate. The Hatters have lost their last three matches including setbacks against FGCU (2-0) and Jacksonville (3-1) Game Day Promotions: The North Florida men's soccer program will be participating in their annual Coaches vs. Cancer game and will sell raffle tickets to win autographed jerseys and soccer balls. The proceeds of the event will go towards the team's initiative to provide mammograms for those who can not afford them. It is the team's goal to raise $900 to pay for nine mammograms. Tickets can be purchased at the game for five dollars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:28:57.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
