Candor down to 15 healthy players this week Notre Dame is credited with a forfeit victory Notre Dame will now host Groton in its homecoming game Oct. 9 Whitney Point was forced to forfeit this week against Chenango Forks CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFriday's scheduled varsity football game between Candor and Elmira Notre Dame has been canceled because Candor was forced to forfeit because it does not have enough eligible players, it was announced Wednesday morning. \nThe game was scheduled to be played at 7 p.m. at Brewer Memorial Stadium and it was to be Notre Dame's homecoming game. Notre Dame will now have its homecoming Oct. 9 against Groton. The special 60th anniversary celebration reception scheduled as part of homecoming has also been rescheduled for Oct. 9, from 5 until 7 p.m. \nCandor was unable to complete last week's 34-0 loss to Oxford because of injuries that led the game to be called in the fourth quarter, with the Indians down to 14 healthy players. Candor head coach Craig Bennett said Wednesday his team had only 15 healthy eligible players this week, one below the minimum required by the New York State Public High School Athletic Association. \nBennett said a meeting was planned for Thursday that will include himself, the building principal and Candor athletic director Steve Frye to determine Candor's plans for the remainder of the season. The Indians are scheduled to host Harpursville/Afton on Oct. 9 and Binghamton Seton Catholic Central on Oct. 16. Class D teams that don't qualify for the playoffs also have the chance to play additional unscheduled games beyond Week 7. \n\"It's tough. It's very tough,\" said Bennett, who is in his third season as Candor's head coach and 16th overall with the program. \"I've been coaching 16 years and haven't really been a part of something like this. We're just getting hit hard with it right now.\" \nNotre Dame is now officially 4-1 and had won two straight games coming into the week. Candor, which began the season with 27 players before injuries and other departures, is now 1-4 after opening with a 14-6 win over rival Spencer-Van Etten. \n\"It's too bad we're not playing, but we understand and we'll just rehash some fundamentals and start getting ready for Groton next week, which will be a tough divisional game,\" Crusaders head coach Mike D'Aloisio said. \nNotre Dame took Wednesday off and is planning to practice Thursday and Friday. The Crusaders are coming off a 30-8 win over Moravia that left them alone in first place of Division VIII of the Section 4 Football Conference with a 2-0 division record. \n\"I was very pleased with what we did last Saturday, but watching the film there's still areas we need to correct and improve on,\" D'Aloisio said. \nAlso this week in Section 4, Whitney Point was forced to forfeit its scheduled home game against Chenango Forks because it doesn't have enough healthy players. David Garbarino, chairman of the Section 4 Football Conference, said Wednesday he was told Whitney Point should be able to play its Week 6 home game against Thomas A. Edison, scheduled for 7 p.m. Oct. 9. \nThese are the first two forfeits in Section 4 this season. \nOn Twitter: @SGAndrewLegare Read or Share this story: http://stargaz.tt/1KLoELN TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:15:29.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
