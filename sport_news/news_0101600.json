The Wheaties (8-2-0-2) had numerous opportunities on their six power-play chances —five of which were in the first two periods — but couldn’t capitalize and outshot Portland 34-14 through the first two frames. They fired 45 total shots at Hill. \nThe Winterhawks (5-6-0-0) opened the scoring in the first period when Dominic Turgeon slipped a shot past Wheat Kings goalie Jordan Papirny just seven seconds into Portland’s first power play of the game in the opening frame. \nAlex Schoenborn beat Papirny short side in the second to double the advantage before Portland rolled off three goals in a 4:05 span in the third to seal the victory. Rodrigo Abols, Skyler McKenzie and Turgeon supplied those markers with Turgeon’s coming on the power play again. \n\"We had a lot of opportunities to score and didn’t,\" said Wheat Kings head coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon. \"I sure felt the first two periods we carried the play. We gave up the third goal and I thought that was the goal that made it real tough to come back.\" \nPapirny, who stopped Keegan Iverson on a breakaway in each of the first two periods, was pulled with 7:45 left in the game. He made 19 saves on the 24 shots he faced. \nLogan Thompson stopped both shots he faced after replacing Papirny. \nIt was first Papirny has been taken out of the game since Dec. 6, 2013. \nLate Friday, the Wheat Kings fell behind 2-1 to the Tri-City Americans in the second period, but a John Quenneville short-handed goal and Rihards Bukarts power-play marker put Brandon up 3-2 before the period ended. \nTri-City tied the game 12:21 into the third, but it didn’t last long. \nBukarts scored his second of the game two minutes later and Jayce Hawryluk managed a bad-angle empty-netter to seal the win with 25 seconds left. \nStelio Mattheos had the other goal for Brandon, which received 21 stops from Papirny. Evan Sarthou made 29 saves for Tri-City. \nSunday’s loss snapped the Wheat Kings’ four-game winning streak and was the first time they suffered defeat on the road in four attempts. \nThey’ll try to get back in the win column on Tuesday (8:30, CKLQ) when they visit the Seattle Thunderbirds, and McCrimmon hopes the specialty teams will be better. \n\"I think a lot of the same things,\" he said about what his team has to do on Tuesday. \"Probably better finish around the net. Our power-play could have helped us and didn’t, so that’s one thing. That’s what we need to do.\" \nICINGS: Portland was 2-for-2 with the man advantage …Brandon F Reid Duke returned to the lineup Sunday after missing Friday’s game with a lower-body injury … Brandon scratched forwards Linden McCorrister, Tim McGauley and Ty Lewis who all have upper-body injuries. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:48:32.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
