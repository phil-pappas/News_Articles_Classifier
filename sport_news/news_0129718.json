Saturday, Ribeiro assisted on back-to-back plays to give the Peregrines a 2-0 lead and then added a goal in the 60'. With the wins, Purdue Calumet improved to 9-1-1 overall and 5-1 in the CCAC. \nThis was the first Player of the Week honor for Ribeiro in his second season with the Peregrines and second CCAC weekly honor this season, after sophomore keeper Miguel David (Spring Valley, Calif./Bonita Vista) was named Defensive Player of the Week earlier this season. \nThe Peregrines will return to action Wednesday, Oct. 14, as they travel to Milwaukee, Wisc. to take on Cardinal Stritch University at 2:00 p.m. CT.
