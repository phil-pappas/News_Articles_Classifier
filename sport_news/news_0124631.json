But her outfit choices recently got Clark into a predicament at school. The yearbook committee rejected her senior portrait. The 17-year-old found out in an email.\nReporter Gina Bullard: Can you read the email?\nLillian Clark: The photo is lovely. Before it can be accepted, we have to abide to school policy in regard to dress code and cleavage.\nClark has other pictures, but she and her family loved the one she submitted the most.\n\"Having a bigger chest is part of who I am,\" she said. \"It's not like I can change it.\"\nAccording to Spaulding High School's handbook, students may not wear clothing which exposes under garments, midriffs, backs or cleavage.\nGina Bullard: Do you think you look too provocative in the picture for school?\nLillian Clark: No, I don't think I do at all.\nSchool officials would not grant our request for an on-camera interview, but did speak with us by phone.\n\"The purpose of our procedures is to provide the most positive educational environment and climate for all of our students,\" said John Pandolfo, the school superintendent.\n\"I wanted something sweeter, so I wanted a dress or a skirt,\" Clark said.\nThumbing through last year's yearbook, Clark found several pictures violating school procedures.\n\"She even has cleavage showing, but her hair is kind of covering it. But you can tell it's there,\" Clark said of one photo.\nThe superintendent says the policy is applied across the board.\n\"In some cases, a decision has to be made. So where is that boundary between appropriate and inappropriate? And that decision is in the hands of the administration of the school. And then, most importantly, when that decision is made it's then applied to all students,\" Pandolfo said.\nOne of Clark's friends also had her photo denied.\nThe school did offer a possible solution to Clark's problem in the email.\n\"You may want to send it to Ashley so she can edit it before it's accepted,\" Clark read from the letter.\nBut after spending $225 to get the photos taken, Clark doesn't like the idea of Photoshopping it. She's hoping school officials will change their minds.\nSchool officials would not tell us how many students had their senior photos rejected from the yearbook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:23:59.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
