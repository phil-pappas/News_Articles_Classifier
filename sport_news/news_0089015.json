Ninety state arrests have also been made during a joing operation to take violent offenders, drugs and illegal weapons off the streets of Savannah,Tarver said.\n“Law enforcement’s top priority is the safety of our citizens,” Tarver said. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will work hand in hand with our federal and state law enforcement partners to remove dangerous criminals who traffick in guns, drugs and fear in the Savannah area. Let me be clear. I believe that some people are dangerous and need to go to prison, sometimes for a very long time. But, arresting criminals is not the only answer to Savannah’s violent crime problem. The U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to provide its support to a number of other anti-crime initiatives, including recidivism reduction campaigns and the City’s “Step Forward” strategy. Working together, we can end the violent crime problems plaguing the great city of Savannah.”\nThe Savannah residents charged within the past week with federal crimes include:\nShavar Spence, a/k/a “Veezy,” 31; charged with drug trafficking, possessing a firearm as a convicted felon and related crimes;\nAntwan Leshawn Coley, a/k/a “Felix,” 32; charged with drug trafficking;\nBraylon Williams, a/k/a “Little Gangster,” 20; charged with drug trafficking;\nLajordan Johnson, 22; charged with drug trafficking and possessing a firearm in furthering of drug trafficking;\nBlanche Spence, 50; charged with drug trafficking and with maintaining a drug-related premises;\nCharles Leonard Mobley, 21; charged with possessing a firearm as a convicted felon;\nMiguel Antwan Mitchell, 28; charged with drug trafficking and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon;\nBruce Lloyd, 30; charged with drug trafficking and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon;\nBrandon Anthony Adams, 28; charged with drug trafficking and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon;\nLaron Allen, 28; charged with possessing a firearm as a convicted felon;\nKwesi Nkosi Chew, 28; charged with drug trafficking and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon;\nTsaddiq Ndesha Chew, 26; charged with drug trafficking and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon;\nRakeem Gallop, a/k/a “Slice,” 25; charged with drug trafficking and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon;\nMichael Simpson, 51; charged with an attempted carjacking; and,\nTodd Benjamin, a/k/a “Todd Royal,” 20; charged with an attempted carjacking.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:09:31.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
