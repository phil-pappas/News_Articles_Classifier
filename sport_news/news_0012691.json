I'm 231 pounds, tell 'em that. Tell 'em that. That's the lowest I've ever played. Tell them I'm feeling great. I ain't got no injuries, I'm feeling good right now. I'm just waiting for my time.\"\nIt arrived Sunday against the Broncos in a 26-23 overtime loss at FirstEnergy Stadium.\nDansby intercepted Peyton Manning twice -- including a 35-yard pick six -- and finished with nine tackles. It was easily the season's most impactful performance for the club's leading tackler.\n\"When you see guys that work hard, put in the effort, been doing it for a long time, when Karlos has a day like that and a couple of the other vets, it just helps everybody, it raises everybody's spirits,\" Browns linebacker Paul Kruger said. \"You need your key guys to make those plays and it just elevates everybody's game, so it was big.\"\nDansby had a solid first season with Browns interrupted by a knee injury that forced him to miss four games. He entered Sunday's contest without a sack, interception, forced fumble or fumble recovery for a defense that's struggled mightily.\nThe linebacker said Friday, however, he believed the big plays were coming.\nNone proved larger than his fourth-quarter pick in which a ball thrown behind Ronnie Hillman caromed off the shoulder pads of the Broncos' running back. After securing the interception, Dansby tight-roped down the right sideline to give the Browns a 20-16 lead with 8:07 left in the fourth quarter.\n\"I was just trying to make sure I didn't step out of bounds,\" he said. \"That goes back to little league. You're just trying to stay inbounds with the ball if you got it. That's what I tried to do and I got into the end zone for a big play.\"\nDansby accounted for two of the Browns' three interceptions – Barkevious Mingo got the other – but the future Hall of Famer rallied the Broncos in crunch time.\nManning threw a 75-yard strike to Emmanuel Sanders just 14 seconds after the Dansby pick six. In overtime, the 39-year-old quarterback led a 13-play, 72-yard drive for the game-winning field goal.\nArguably the biggest play was an 18-yard completion to Owen Daniels with Dansby in coverage on a third-and-4 from the Broncos' 18. Manning finished 26-of-48 for 290 yards and a 53.3 passer rating.\n\"He made plays,\" Dansby said. \"He got his opportunity and he capitalized on it. He made the right call at the right time and like I said, they made plays down the stretch.\"\nDansby made plays, too. They just weren't enough to overcome another close loss.", "external_links": ["http://player.performgroup.com/eplayer.js#43783e3de07d23bc939b09a00b.aku1u7oix7o91rcozzak4hjc9.s"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:38:36.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
