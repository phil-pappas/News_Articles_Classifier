The notion of positive freedom is most usefully captured in terms of the ‘states of being and doing’ — as Sen puts it — which one is able to attain. These states of attainment are what Sen refers to as ‘human functionings’. A person's ‘positive freedom’ could be assessed in terms of the combinations of various states of being and doing — or ‘functioning-bundles’ — which are available to the person to choose from. Positive freedom, in short, is an indicator of what a person is able to achieve; and certain very basic functionings which one may be imagined to have a right to attain are those relating to satisfactory levels of nutrition, clothing, shelter, health, longevity, mobility, and knowledge. The notion of negative freedom — or 'liberty', for short — refers to the freedom which a person has, without let or hindrance, to pursue his or her own desired ends within what John Stewart Mill referred to as that person's ‘personal protected sphere’. Common negative freedoms, enshrined as rights which may not be interfered with, would include the right to bodily integrity, to freedom of speech, of thought, of religious conviction, and of association. Positive freedoms enable the attainment of desired outcomes, while negative freedoms protect a person from illegitimate coercion or restraint. Deprivation can be seen as the failure to achieve certain valued human functionings or to realise certain valued personal liberties. An important social dimension of deprivation resides in the equitableness with which positive and negative freedoms are distributed across the members of a population, when the population is partitioned according to certain well-defined social categories, such as on the basis of race, class, caste, religion, gender, or place of origin. When particular groups are found to be systematically relatively disadvantaged in the distribution of a society’s burdens and benefits, then we may speak of the resulting group-inequality as reflecting discrimination against the groups in question. Drawing considerably on collaborative work I have done with my colleague D Jayaraj, I shall focus attention on the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, as a composite group, which together will simply be referred to as the SCST group. The remainder of the population will simply be referred to as ‘the Others’. The following factual account of caste discrimination in the distribution of positive and negative freedoms in Indian society will constitute my description of caste and deprivation in the country. I first consider aspects of caste discrimination in the distribution of positive freedoms. Take caste and money-metric poverty. In around the mid-1980s it was found that in a couple of states — Bihar and Orissa — the mean consumption of the SCST group was actually less than the official poverty line: minimisation of the headcount ratio of poverty would require eliminating a certain proportion of the population (equal to the proportionate shortfall of the mean from the poverty line), which is essentially a solution dictated by the horrifying mechanics of triage. Further, it was found that while the SCST group accounted for just 29 per cent of the general Indian population, it accounted for 50 per cent of the population in poverty. Consider next the polar extremes of wealth-holding, in terms of the wealthiest (as measured by possession of household assets) 1 per cent of the population, at one extreme, and of total assetless-ness at the other extreme. The survey data for 1991-92 on the distribution of household assets across households suggest that the prevalence of the ‘Others’ group in the ‘top 1 per cent’ category is 15 times that of the SCST group while, in a precise inversion of this pattern, the prevalence of the SCST group is three times that of the ‘Others’ group in the ‘bottom assetless’ category. There has been much talk about ‘growth with justice’ and ‘inclusive growth’ in the official Indian discourse on planning and development. How much of this is real and how much rhetoric, how much is actual achievement and how much no more than a perfunctory statement of intent? One approach to reckoning inclusiveness is to see if the product of growth in consumption is distributed in line with the share of each caste-group in the total population. By this reckoning, there is little evidence of caste-related inclusiveness in the record of consumption growth in India. More specifically, let us designate as the ‘warranted’ consumption of any caste-group in any year the level of per capita consumption that would accrue to it if the growth in consumption were allocated proportionately to the share of the caste-group in the population. One can now compare the ‘warranted’ consumption level with the actual consumption level for each caste-group over time. By considering the quinquennial consumption expenditure surveys of the National Sample Survey Office from 1983 to 2009-10, it turns out that whereas equitable or inclusive growth should imply a ratio of warranted-to-actual consumption that is exactly one for each caste-group in each year of the reference period, this ratio is systematically less than unity for the SCST group and greater than unity for the ‘Others’ group, in both the rural and urban areas of the country. One should be pardoned for finding it hard to detect in such statistics any evidence of caste-inclusiveness in the growth of consumption expenditure in India. Illiteracy is perhaps the worst and most fundamental form of denial of the right to knowledge that one can think of. Virtually without exception for every state in the country, it is found that when pairs of groups differ only with respect to gender, in each pair the group with females has a higher illiteracy rate than the group with males; and when pairs of groups differ only with respect to caste, in each pair the group with SCs and STs has a higher level of illiteracy than the group with ‘Others’. The 1981 Census data (I report here on work done with Manabi Majumdar) suggest that the polar extremes of disadvantage and advantage respectively are reflected by the groups of SCST rural females and ‘Others’ urban males, with illiteracy rates of 93.7 per cent and 20.7 per cent, respectively. These numbers precisely reflect Dr Ambedkar’s life-long concern with the disadvantage visited on individuals by the accidents of caste and gender, and the denial to them of access to modernity. — This is the first part of a two-part article.
