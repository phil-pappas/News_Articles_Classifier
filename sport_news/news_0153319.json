The Angels are also tied with the Minnesota Twins.\nThat means the Angels not only need to win, but they need the Astros to lose at least once over the weekend against the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nIf the Angels and Astros tie after Sunday’s games, they would play a tiebreaker game in Houston. If all three teams tie, the Twins and Astros would play and the winner would host the Angels.\nNow, instead of simply win-and-you’re-in, the Angels need help, thanks to two straight losses after their seven-game winning streak.\nAfter losing Wednesday because of a season-high four errors, Thursday's game fell apart in one frustrating inning.\nThe Angels had a 1-0 in the middle of the fifth, with Andrew Heaney having worked his way around three walks and two hits in the first four innings.\nIn the fifth, Heaney gave up a leadoff single to Elvis Andrus. After a popout, he walked Robinson Chirinos. Delino DeShields then lined a double into center field, driving in one run.\nHeaney then threw a 2-2 pitch that appeared to be on the inside corner to Shin-Soo Choo, but he didn’t get the call. He then walked Choo on the next pitch.\nAdrian Beltre then yanked a 2-2 slider that wasn’t even a strike into left field for a three-run double, putting the Rangers up 4-1.\nThe situation certainly opened Manager Mike Scioscia up to second-guessing about why he didn’t pull Heaney, who had thrown 79 pitches after the walk to Choo.\nThe problem was that two of the next three hitters were left-handed, so if Scioscia would have brought in a righty to face the right-handed Beltre, it would have likely been for just one batter. That would have begun a flood of relievers in the fifth inning.\nAs it turned out, he started anyway, because he pulled Heaney after the Beltre double, bringing in another lefty, Jose Alvarez, for just three batters.\nThe Angels got back into the game on Albert Pujols’ 39 th homer in the sixth, and a two-out RBI single from Erick Aybar in the seventh. Kole Calhoun then hit a chopper into the hole on the left side, but shortstop Elvis Andrus made a nice play and a strong throw to get the third out.\nAdding some salt to the Angels' wounds, Josh Hamilton had a big hand in their defeat.\nIn the second inning, he made a sprawing catch at the fence to rob Shane Victorino of an extra-base hit. He also doubled and hit a sacrifice fly to add an insurance run in the seventh.\nContact the writer: jlfletcher@ocregister.com\nRelated: Angels Notes: Mike Scioscia still confident in Taylor Featherston's defense On deck: Angels at Rangers, Friday, 5 p.m. Angels Podcast Angels-Rangers box score", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/angels-652893-baseball-podcast.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/taylor-685666-defense-texas.html", "http://sports.ocregister.com/mlb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=351001113", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/angels-685709-weaver-face.html"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:07:11.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
