But this year as we saw the competition in our race, we started to believe we could do it.” \nNine of the other 10 teams in the race, the largest of the day had already had a runner finish (Lyndhurst had three and Ramsey, Glen Rock and Leonia had two each) when junior Anthony Michielini came across the line 15th in 17:25, a time that wouldn’t have qualified him for Saturday’s Lou Molino Bergen Meet of Champions as an individual. But by the time the Cowboys’ fifth runner, junior Jack Rossig, finished in 25th place in 17:56, no team had as many runners across the line as Pascack Hills, and when sophomore Peter Skibin, Hills’ seventh and final runner, crossed the line in 29th place in 18:05, no other team had as many as five finished. \n“We have five juniors, a sophomore and Charlie on the varsity today,” said Hills coach Bob Buccino, who also singled out the other senior on the Cowboys’ roster — eighth man Joey Tortora. “All the kids are great friends and they’ve everything we’ve asked of them this year. \n“We have so much depth and we have some great freshmen who are going to help us next year,” said DiPiazza. “Winning this [title] this year means everything to me. Cross-country and this team has been the biggest part of my life this year and it’ll stay with me my whole life — these guys are my family.” \nFor River Dell, the pack comes after the 1-2-3 punch of Will and Colin Daly and Patrick Robertson, as good as any upfront trio in North Jersey. \nBut Saturday, huge personal bests from sophomore Gary Wilhelm and juniors Dan Murray and Matt Tina, even in the absence of junior Chris Murray, sidelined with a minor injury, that enabled the Golden Hawks to win their first division title in 12 years and keep them on course for sectional and state honors that are goals next month. \n“Those four kids and other eighth guy John Forester have been our Silent Majority,” said River Dell boys coach Steffan DelPiano. “They have been consistently improving all year and are giving us the chance to have the best team in school history.” \n“We told them before the race that this was their race,” said Colin Daly. “We wanted them to run faster and get closer to the three of us, because when we get in a big race at Garret [sectionals] or Holmdel [states] they’re going to have to find someone to run with and run faster than they ever had for us to have a chance at making the state Meet of Champions.” \nAnd the pack has responded, with Wilhelm, Dan Murray and Tina breaking 17 minutes for the first time at Darlington on the heels of Garret Mountain personal bests the week before. \n“We’re just trying to move on and move up,” said Wilhelm. \n“Coach stressed that we needed to get big PRs and we’re getting them,” said Dan Murray. “Besides, when those three graduate, we have to step up and be the ones in front — so this was really also the first meet of next year.” \nOther teams that benefitted from great packs in the back were Bogota’s boys, three of who’s final four runners scored Darlington bests and Ridgewood’s girls, who won a sixth straight and record 29th divisional title overall when its 3-6 runners finished in a 28-second span from eighth to 13th to turn a tight race with Northern Highlands into a rout. \nDon Bosco had the ultimate pack in the small Division A race, with its seven runners running together for the entire 5,000-meter course, finishing together in times between 16:08 and 16:10 and nearly running afoul of the cross-country rules that prevent runners from holding hands as they cross the finish line. \nAnd of course the Indian Hills boys team ran a pretty good pack race in slicing up Division B and a good Ridgewood team. The Braves went 1-2-4-6-9-10 within 25 seconds of each other and the team time of 79 minutes, 13 seconds, a time bettered by only the 2008 and 2014 Don Bosco teams. \nA pack is a pack no matter where in the race it appears. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:21:50.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
