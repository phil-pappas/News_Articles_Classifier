CHARLES – Seniors on the St. Charles North girls volleyball team will remember Tuesday evening for more than being recognized for their contributions to the program. \nThey also will relish achieving one of the team’s goals for the season – a perfect Upstate Eight Conference River Division record. \nThe North Stars topped Elgin in two sets, 25-19, 25-13, on senior night, completing their River Division schedule with a 6-0 mark. \nThe unblemished division record also guarantees North (26-3, 6-0 UEC River) will be alone at the top of the standings, unlike last year. \n“This is something that the seniors have set out to do since they were freshmen and was very important to them,” North coach Lindsey Hawkins said. “Last year we had to share [the title] with [St. Charles East] and Geneva, a blow to our self-esteem, I guess because we really wanted it. So this year they made it their goal to come out and show people that they were the best.” \n“It’s awesome,” said Claire Anderson, who had six kills. “It’s really a great way to end our senior year.” \n“I think we had some nerves we’re trying to work out and some emotions...that’s pretty normal,” Hawkins said. “I felt pretty confident in the way they were playing, that they could dig themselves out of a hole.” \nElgin (9-16, 1-5) was unable to maintain the momentum in the second set as the North Stars led from start to finish. \n“I knew the second game was going to be tougher,” Stewart said. “Whenever you’re close with the team on their home court in game one, they come back out more focused and fired up in game two, so I knew it to be a little tougher. But, overall, I’m pretty happy with the effort.” \nDaley Krage had nine kills for North while classmate Jaclyn Taylor dished out 13 assists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:54:24.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
