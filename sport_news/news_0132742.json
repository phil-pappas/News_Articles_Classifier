The series between the Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers averaged only 2.4 million viewers. The Kansas City Royals’ four-game series win over the Houston Astros drew 3.1 million viewers.\nIt seems a certainty that the Mets-Cubs series will draw a bigger audience than the Toronto-Kansas City series not only because of their large markets, but for the pent-up fervor of their fans, especially those who root for the Cubs. The last time the Cubs were in the N.L.C.S., in 2003 against the Florida Marlins, the seven-game series on Fox attracted an average of 16.8 million viewers, the most in the decade. The Marlins’ 9-6 win in Game 7 was seen by 26.5 million viewers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:01:53.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
