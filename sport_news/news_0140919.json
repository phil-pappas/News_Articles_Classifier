Cain was sidelined by a sore right knee, and Rios was scratched because of a stiff back. Closer Wade Davis was unavailable due to a stiff back.\nAll the injured players are day to day, and the AL Central champions held on for their second straight victory against the lowly White Sox. Kris Medlen (6-2) pitched six innings of two-run ball, and Ryan Madson tossed a perfect ninth for his third save.\nKansas City (92-67) finishes the season with three games at Minnesota, while Toronto, which holds the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Royals, closes with a weekend series at Tampa Bay.\nJohn Danks dropped his third consecutive start as Chicago lost for the seventh time in nine games. The White Sox (74-85) went 7-12 against the Royals in 2015 and have lost the season series to Kansas City in each of the last five years.\nDanks (7-15) was tagged for six runs and 11 hits — matching a season high — in five innings. The left-hander dropped to 10-3 in 22 career starts against the Royals.\nJose Abreu's two-run single in the seventh trimmed Kansas City's lead to 6-4 and gave him 101 RBIs on the year. The Cuban slugger became the second player in major league history with 30 or more homers and 100-plus RBIs in each of his first two seasons, joining Albert Pujols.\nThe White Sox almost pulled within one in the eighth, but Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera made a nifty tag between his legs to get Alexei Ramirez at the plate for the final out. Ramirez tried to score after a pitch got away from catcher Drew Butera.\nGRIEVING YOUNG \nKansas City RHP Chris Young is back on the mound on Friday night for his first start since he pitched five no-hit innings Sunday, a day after his father died. He plans to return home to Dallas this weekend and then rejoin the Royals for the start of the playoffs.\nYoung said pitching and being around the team is a \"welcome distraction.\"\n\"It's a great group,\" he said. \"Guys are so uplifting, and honestly, they picked me up the other day. They made some great defensive plays. They told me, 'We got you today. We're winning this game. We got you,' and it meant so much to me.\"\nABOUT NEXT YEAR \nU.S. Cellular Field will have three new videoboards next season, according to the White Sox. The main scoreboard in center and the auxiliary screens in left and right field will be replaced. The changes will be paid for by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which owns the stadium.\nTRAINER'S ROOM \nRoyals: Cain fouled a pitch off his knee in the seventh inning of Wednesday night's 5-3 victory over the White Sox.\nWhite Sox: Rookie 2B Micah Johnson had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on Thursday morning. Scar tissue was removed, and the team said the knee was structurally sound. He is expected to be ready for spring training. ... C Tyler Flowers was shaken up after a foul ball got him in the sixth, but he stayed in the game.\nUP NEXT \nRoyals: Plenty at stake in Kansas City's closing series at Minnesota. The Twins are fighting for the second AL wild card.\nWhite Sox: LHP Chris Sale (12-11, 3.48 ERA) needs three strikeouts to break Ed Walsh's season franchise record of 269 set in 1908. Sale faces Detroit RHP Alfredo Simon (13-11, 5.18 ERA) on Friday night.\nC opyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) and the Associated Press.
