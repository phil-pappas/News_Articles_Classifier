Including Sunday's 27-20 loss to the Giants, the Cowboys have now lost four in a row and sit in dead last of the NFC East. \nNone of that seems to bother Dez Bryant , though.\nAs the Cowboys wide receiver was walking off the field at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, he told Giants fans that the Cowboys are \"still gonna run the East\" this year.\n#Cowboys @DezBryant leaves the field with a promise - \"We still gon' run the East!\" #WFAACowboys #NFL pic.twitter.com/5u5gyo2IiT \nâ€” Mike Leslie (@MikeLeslieWFAA) October 25, 2015 Considering that the Cowboys (2-4) are stuck with either Brandon Weeden or Matt Cassel for at least the next three weeks, that's a lot of confidence coming from Bryant. \nRomo isn't expected to return until Week 11, which means the Cowboys will have to play the Seahawks and the Eagles in the next two weeks without him.\nEven if Bryant gets back on the field for next Sunday's game against Seattle, beating the Seahawks with Cassel (or Weeden) under center is going to be almost impossible. \nThe Cowboys also still have to play the Packers and Panthers. Basically, winning the NFC East is getting closer and closer to being out of the question. Dez might want to start focusing on getting a wild card berth. Dez Bryant is pretty confident about the rest of the season.
