HUDSON — On a night Hudson looked back at its glory days, Hillsdale continued to look ahead with a 35-0 rout Friday night at Thompson Field. The Hornets (6-3) scored early and often to clinch its 15th straight playoff appearance. Hudson fell to 4-5, its first losing season since 2006. Hillsdale entered the game needing a win to get into the postseason and head coach Marc Lemerand said the team practiced all week with the idea the playoffs started in Week 9. “Our kids, I thought that this was a playoff game,” Lemerand said. “That’s what we said after last week’s loss (in double overtime to Ida) we are in the playoffs now. “It’s win and advance and your season’s over when you don’t. Hillsdale’s defense set the tone on the first drive with a 3-and-out followed up by converting a blocked punt into six quick points. Trevor Kornak blocked the punt and D.J. Jones scooped the ball up at the Tiger 3 and rumbled in with only 1:27 gone in the game. The Hornets limited the Tigers to 88 yards total offense, all on the ground. They picked off three Hudson passes (two by Tom Lawnhorn and one by Jake Schaffner). “I am finally able to exhale,” defensive coordinator Jerry Curby said. “I’ve been on edge all week.” The offensive scheme the Tigers use can drive opposing coaches into fits, but the Hornets were ready for them this year. Hudson is always tough and their coaches always game plan well, so the result was satisfying. “The fact we were able to get the shutout is, wow,” Curby said. Outside linebackers Colin Munsell, Kornak and Bryce Beilfuss (under the tutelage of Lemerand) were credited by Curby for shutting down the Tigers’ run game. The Hornets meanwhile played steady and pounded the Tigers defense for 274 yards. Ridge Morris led the attack with 71 yards on 16 carries, while Martin Petersen ran for 63 yards on 12 carries. Petersen completed 8 of 11 passes for 83 yards and one touchdown, a 9-yard strike to Jake Lemerand. Petersen also ran for three touchdowns as he and his teammates kept the streak of playoff appearances alive. “It’s definitely an honor to be a part of this program and the history that’s been going on for 15 years,” Petersen said. “It’s definitely special. And to come out do it against a Hudson team we’ve struggled with the last couple of years to get a big win - that’s a good football team we beat.” Page 2 of 2 - “To do that tonight, it was a very special night.” While the offense was putting points on the board, kicker Joe Phillip kept sending the ball through the end zone or booming his punts for a 35.5-yard average. The win keeps Hillsdale’s run of making the state playoffs every year since 2001 intact. Lemerand said the streak is something that’s there and everyone knows it’s there, but the goal is to improve every week. There are some areas such as penalties the team needs to improve on, but the Hornets are in good shape for Week 10. “If the team can make some plays and win some games and stay in the playoffs, that’s great,” Lemerand said. “So now it’s keep playing.” Hillsdale will learn it’s playoff opponent Sunday night. Notes: Hudson honored the teams that were part of the school’s 72-game winning streak that ended in 1975. The 2010 state championship team was also honored. Hudson coach Chris Luma, who was a part of the winning streak, said while he is likely to return to coaching next year, he wants a break from a stressful season.
