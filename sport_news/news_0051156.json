Nick Saban was still coaching the Miami Dolphins, in fact. \nThe streak hit eight years last fall with a 34-20 Crimson Tide win in Knoxville. At least part of that was news to Alabama junior defensive end Jonathan Allen. \n\"I didn't even know there was a winning streak, to be honest with you,\" Allen said. \"That's the first time I've heard about it. I'd like to continue the streak, but that's not what I'm focused on. We just want to go out there and play good football.\" \nThis, of course, is one of Alabama's biggest rivalries dating back to a 6-6 tie in 1901. The two can't even agree on the overall series record. Alabama says it holds a 51-38-7 edge while Tennessee credit the Tide with another win, 52-38-7. \nIt's been a rivalry of streaks recently. The Vols took seven straight from 1995-2001. Alabama's run began in 2007, Saban's first year in Tuscaloosa. All but one of the wins came by double figures in that span. \n\"I've got a lot of respect for Tennessee, I've always grown up watching those games,\" said Alabama quarterback Jake Coker, a Mobile native. \"So yeah it means a whole lot.\" \nAlabama's roster lists 40 players from instate. The rest came from elsewhere and had to learn about the rivalry. That includes Allen, a product of Virginia. \n\"It means a lot to me. A lot of alumni care so much about this rivalry, plus being in it for the last years, I definitely understand the significance of this game,\" he said. \"But it is another SEC opponent. I'm not going to do anything our of the normal that we wouldn't already do for any other game.\" Jonathan Allen talks Texas A&M, Alabama-Tennessee rivalry Jonathan Allen talks Texas A&M, Alabama-Tennessee rivalry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:25:37.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
