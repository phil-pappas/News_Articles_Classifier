(Photo: Murray State Athletics) \nKD Humphries is putting up big numbers at Murray State. \nThe redshirt junior from Montgomery leads all NCAA FCS teams in passing yards with 2,110 through six games. Humphries is also first in attempts (291) and completions (193) for the Racers (2-4, 1-2 OVC). He's thrown 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. \nLast week, Humphries threw for 286 yards on 32-of-51 passing in Murray State's 34-18 homecoming win over Austin Peay to snap a four-game losing skid. The Jeff Davis graduate ran for two touchdowns in the win. Humphries has four rushing touchdowns on the season. \nCurrently on a bye week, Murray State will play its next game Oct. 24 at UT Martin (3-2, 1-1). For his Week 4 efforts, thanks to you, @TheChozenHump was named @HeroSportsNews FCS Off.
