Villaruel   20, 2015 - 12:00am \nCEBU, Philippines â€“ The University of San Carlos Warriors and the University of the Visayas Green Lancers are out to settle their unfinished business for one last time as they collide in the deciding match of their best-of-five collegiate division finals in the 15th Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc. men's basketball tournament tonight at the Cebu Coliseum. \nIt has been a roller-coaster ride for the fiercest rivals for the coveted championship of the league, with USC enjoying a slim 4-3 edge in head-to-head record in seven meetings overall against UV this season. \nBack in the elimination round, the Warriors drew first blood, 76-66, but the Lancers bounced back in style courtesy of a 74-43 massacre. \nThe Warriors, however, quickly erased the sting of that humiliating setback by outlasting the Lancers in overtime, 74-70, during their lone semifinal encounter. \nNow comes the finals showdown. \nThe Warriors again broke the ice via a 76-70 decision, but the Lancers, with June Kent Manzo leading the charge, lashed back in Game 2, 70-63.   \nThe Carolinians this time diffused another explosive performance by Manzo to come up with a big 87-76 win in Game 3, but then again the Lancers showed tremendous will power when it mattered most, crushing the Warriors in the fourth game, 60-52, to send the series into its full route. \nNow that everything is back to square once again, expect both sides to put up a decisive and gallant final stand against each other, with the Warriors clinging on to their hopes of winning their first ever CESAFI title and the Lancers hoping to live up to their battlecry of 'fighting best when the odds are greatest' in their pursuit of an 11th crown. \nFor USC coach Britt Carlo Reroma, the ultimate winner of what had been an exciting, unpredictable series will be decided on which side will carry out its gameplan to the letter in a sudden-death battle where there must be no margin of error in execution of plays on both ends. \n\"In every finals series, especially Game 5, it boils down to who wants it more, we the hungry Warriors or the powerhouse Lancers. It boils down to execution in defense and offense. We will give our very best to give USC its first title in school history,\" said Reroma. \nTo carry out their historic mission, the Warriors depend heavily on their foreign import Shooster Olago and a bunch of local gunners in Ian Tagapan, Charles Pepito, Victor Rabat, Nico Magat and Ian Ortega, among others. \nThe Lancers, on the other hand, count the most from Steve Cedrick Akomo along with their 'Hitman' Manzo and veteran wards in Franz Arong, Alfred Codilla, Arvie Cabanero and Alwin Aguirre. They could also draw support from the likes of Joshue Segupan, Jerome Napao, Rey Suerte and Vincent Mendoza. \nFor what they've been through this season, UV coach Gary Cortes hope to savor their final moment with a sweet taste of success. \n\"We survived all the trials that smacked out way this season. We hit the bottom low with our moral and confidence but we picked up some missing piece until we reach the finals, so this is it. We must play as a team. A title-hungry Lancers will play against USC position by position. And we must be consistent from start to finish,\" said Cortes.
