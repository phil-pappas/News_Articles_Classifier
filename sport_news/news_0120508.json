Hernandez scored his second 15 minutes later after playing a 1-2 with Calhanoglu. The Mexican's first shot was saved by Wojciech Szczesny but the follow-up doubled Leverkusen's advantage. \nRoma got one back in the 30th minute when Leverkusen keeper Bernd Leno could only half-clear a corner, and the ball eventually fell to Daniele De Rossi to score. The Italian side equalised eight minutes later when De Rossi redirected a freek kick by Pjanic, and the Bosnian curled in the winner with a long free kick early in the second half. \nGervinho then found Iago Falque in the box to widen Roma's lead in the 73rd minute, but Leverkusen were not finished as Kevin Kampl scored in the 84th minute and Admir Mehmedi completed the comeback two minutes later. \nZenit St Petersburg stayed perfect in Group H, defeating Lyon 3-1 for their third win from three games. \nArtem Dzyuba provided Zenit a lead inside three minutes, but Alexandre Lacazette equalised for the French side shortly after the break. \nBut Hulk put the hosts back in front eight minutes later with a blast from 30 yards, and Danny added a third goal seven minutes from time. \nValenica used a Stefan Mitrovic own goal to squeeze out a 2-1 win at home against Belgian champions Gent. \nSofiane Feghouli and Thomas Foket exchanged first-half goals, but Valencia took the lead again in the 72nd minute when a lobbed cross hit off the top of the crossbar, and fell to Jose Luis Gaya, whose shot deflected off Mitrovic and into the net. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
