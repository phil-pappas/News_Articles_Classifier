I think that’s a very exciting thing. \n“I think it’s disappointing that Ian has that view.” \nThe Cricket All-Stars Series will be played over three matches in New York, Houston and Los Angeles next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:32:39.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
