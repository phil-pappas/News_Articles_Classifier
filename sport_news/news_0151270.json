(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — With the Los Angeles Dodgers trying to earn home-field advantage in the NL Division Series, the San Diego Padres appear to be ideal fodder this weekend. \nThe Dodgers won 6-2 Friday night for their fourth straight victory over the Padres, helping Los Angeles move a half-game ahead of the rained-out New York Mets in their race for the home-field edge in their upcoming playoff series. \nThe Padres lost for the fourth time in their last five games and dropped to 35-44 on the road with two games remaining in the season. \nCasey Kelly (0-2) gave up six runs — three earned — and eight hits in 4 1-3 innings in his second start of the season after missing most of the last two years while recovering from Tommy John surgery. The right-hander struck out three and walked two. \n“I thought Casey pitched better than his line,” Padres interim manager Pat Murphy said. “They did square up some fastballs pretty good, so it looked like they were seeing his fastball pretty good. He gave up the big inning again, but it wasn’t all his fault.” \nSan Diego scored twice in the seventh on Alexi Amarista’s groundout and Cody Decker’s sacrifice fly, his first major league RBI. \n“I have a stat and that’s a good start,” Decker said. “I would have liked for us to get a win, but a stat is a stat. And any big league stat is better than all of my minor league stats combined. Actually, that’s probably not true, but no one’s ever going to look at my minor league stats and go, ‘Oh, what a ballplayer!’ There’s still more to come.” \nCorey Seager’s two-run single highlighted a five-run third inning for the Dodgers. \nThey improved to 90-70 — their third straight season with that many wins — after the Mets (89-70) got rained out earlier. New York, however, holds the tiebreaker because it won the season series. \nThe Mets are scheduled to play a doubleheader Saturday against Washington. They face the Dodgers in the NL Division Series starting next Friday. \nDodgers starter Alex Wood (12-12) allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings, struck out four and walked one. \nThe Dodgers broke open the game in the third when Kelly gave up three straight one-out singles. Adrian Gonzalez’s RBI single scored their first run and Justin Turner followed with a grounder for another run. \nSeager’s two-run single made it 4-0, and A.J. Ellis’ RBI single completed the burst. \nTurner’s RBI single in the fifth extended the lead to 6-0. \nTRAINER’S ROOM \nPadres: OF Justin Upton, who has a neck strain, isn’t able to swing a bat, so he would be limited to pinch running or playing his position for a couple of innings in the last two games. \nDodgers: OF Yasiel Puig, on the DL with a strained right hamstring, will rejoin the team this weekend after running and playing in the field the last two days in Arizona. \nREPLACING SHIELDS \nJames Shields won’t make his scheduled start Sunday because the Padres want to evaluate their bullpen. The expected starter is left-hander Frank Garces, who will face Clayton Kershaw. \nUP NEXT \nPadres: Robbie Erlin (1-1, 6.30 ERA) gave up four runs and four hits in 1 2-3 innings of last weekend’s loss to San Francisco. \nDodgers: Zack Greinke (18-3, 1.68) has won his last seven home starts with a 1.07 ERA in that span, and continues to lead the majors in ERA. He is 5-1 with a 1.61 ERA in 11 career starts against the Padres.
