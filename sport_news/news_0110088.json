When a takeaway service is short of drivers, it can order in a few couriers to deliver meals to customers. On Valentine’s Day, a flower shop can stock up on Uber drivers.\nUber has been partnering with a few brands across the U.S. over the last six months, competing with FedEx, UPS, and other courier services. Instead of working for one business, Uber can pick up multiple packages from multiple businesses at one time, which should make the service more efficient for small businesses.\nBusinesses use the merchant portal to order and pay the couriers. Uber pays the driver between 75 and 80 percent of the cost for delivery, and takes the rest. The average delivery will cost between $5 and $7, according to Uber.\nThis is all similar to another startup Postmates , but instead of integrating the menu into the app, Uber will work in the background. This means any business can order a courier, opening up opportunities and “one off” orders for Uber, instead of having to partner with the company for the long term.\nUber Rush begins in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago. In San Francisco, couriers will deliver on bikes or cars, in Chicago couriers will only use cars, and in New York couriers will use bikes or walk. For now, a courier cannot also be a cab driver. In the future, we might see the two systems come together, allowing a driver to choose what he wants to deliver: people, presents, or food.\nRelated: Uber Hits Roadblock, Major Back-end System Instability\nUber has already shown it is willing to invest heavily to win a market. Against established companies like UPS and FedEx, it might need to lower delivery prices to win business. At least for couriers, Uber does not appear to be breaking any laws in New York, San Francisco, or Chicago, though we’re sure some lawsuits will come once Uber establishes market share.\nUber did not disclose where the courier service will be available next. London, Paris, and Shenzhen are three of the most popular cities outside of the United States, so we would suspect trials might start in those cities shortly.\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends\nContent provided by", "external_links": ["http://www.digitaltrends.com/business/uber-rush-launch/", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/users/dcurry/", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/postmates-takes-on-uber-and-others-with-speedy-meal-delivery-service/", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/uber-launches-uberrush-courier-service/", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/", "http://images.worldnow.com/digitaltrends/images/562919_G.jpg", "https://rush.uber.com/how-it-works", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/uber-hack-traced-to-lyft-cto/", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/uber-system-instability/", "http://images.worldnow.com/digitaltrends/images/204415_G.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:23:25.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
