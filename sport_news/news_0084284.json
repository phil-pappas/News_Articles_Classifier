These parties often become the site of some heavy pre-game prep, and Louisiana State University’s home game was no exception.\nAhead of the match, a group of Tigers fans decided to have some fun with their opposition’s mascot, sparking the insanity that is college football fandom.\nLSU supporters took to the notion that their side would “grill” the opposition, and did exactly that to the Florida Gators mascot.\nAlligator is on the pit. #LSU #Florida #GameDay pic.twitter.com/Kc4W4anrLc\n— Michelle (@Mimo1001) October 17, 2015 Cooking gator before the LSU Gator game https://t.co/qhBJ4XtsEp\n— NOLA.com (@NOLAnews) October 17, 2015 What do we eat?

How do you like your gator?” the caption said.\nThe extent of their trolling knows no bounds.\nLuckily for LSU, taunts looked to have got the better of the visiting side, with the Gators going down 35-28 to their jovial opponents.\nJump back to top\nsport breaking news 18:13 PM Live: Victoria closes on second spot 21:14 PM Heartache Hilton: Bulls down dogged CA XI 20:00 PM Giants unapologetic over Treloar, McCarthy 14:28 PM Fanning ‘upset’ by KFC’s shark attack ad 11:07 AM Proteas keeper equals Sachin Tendulkar", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/LSU?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/NOLAnews/status/655468937635897344", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Florida?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/rickgreene23/status/655388890811863040", "https://t.co/qhBJ4XtsEp", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameDay?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Mimo1001/status/655395488649232384", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/football?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/gators?src=hash", "http://t.co/Kc4W4anrLc", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/sec?src=hash", "https://instagram.com/p/85uRD-nJ6s/embed", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeauxTigers?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/brantleysalter", "http://t.co/FU9Km4RQOT", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/98b4e7f93c60f338808ee400280d47e9", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "https://twitter.com/LSUfball"], "published": "2015-10-18T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:48:55.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
