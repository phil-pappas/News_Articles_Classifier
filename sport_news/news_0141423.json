Galaxy in front of an announced attendance of 56,097 at CenturyLink.\n“I’m a poacher,” Barrett said. “I like being in there. The balls just seem to find me. … You just have to be in the right place at the right time. \nMost Read Stories Our state’s greatest gift to the nation just got canceled Roads could be a mess this weekend — and Monday New GM Jerry Dipoto provides more insight into how he’ll turn Mariners around Seven things to know about Seahawks rookie Tyler Lockett Survivor: Gunman spared 'lucky one' to give police message Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. “When you get your moments, you’ve got to step up. And I love the spotlight. I’m 30 now and it might not last too much longer. I’m going to soak it up.”\nThe whole Sounders (14-13-5) lineup was long in the tooth, even after 28-year-old Lamar Neagle replaced Nelson Valdez, 31 and suffering from a nagging calf strain, in the starting lineup.\nThe average age of the starting XI was north of 31, and at 29, midfielder Osvaldo Alonso was the only outfield player younger than 30. \nLeo Gonzalez, 34, filled in for injured rookie Oniel Fisher at left back. Zach Scott, 35 years young, replaced Chad Marshall at center back – and played an unfortunately leading role in setting up L.A.’s goal.\nEarly this season, when he was still making the transition from midfield to full-time defense, Seattle captain Brad Evans said it was difficult to turn off the part of his brain that told him to play the ball out of danger.\nAs a midfielder, Evans could take risks that were unacceptable in the back. Rather than try to take on an opponent, or play a pass to a teammate in close quarters, defenders are sometimes better off blasting the ball out of bounds and hitting reset.\nIt’s a lesson that teammate Scott was reminded of in a painful way on Sunday.\nMidway through a mostly even first half, Scott dribbled a one-touch pass along the edge of his own penalty box in the general direction of teammate Gonzalo Pineda.\nReigning league MVP Robbie Keane, lurking in dangerous areas as always, pounced. Keane beat Pineda to the ball, swooped in alone on stranded goalkeeper Stefan Frei and finished inside the right post.\nScott’s reaction said it all. The veteran hunched over, cupping both hands over a slack-jawed mouth.\n“You don’t say anything there,” Evans said. “It’s, ‘Let’s go.’ Pick the ball out of the net and we’ll carry on. … It’s squashed. It’s done. It’s a guy that’s done so much for the club and that bleeds rave green.”\nYou also try to pick him up, to at least partially shield him from accusatory points and stares. Seattle swarmed around the edges of L.A.’s penalty box throughout the second half, constantly threatening even if they didn’t create all that many clear-cut chances.\nAndreas Ivanschitz popped up behind the Galaxy back line but couldn’t settle Marco Pappa’s pass. Barrett bounced a pass across an empty goal but L.A. somehow hacked it off the goal line. Clint Dempsey side-footed a first-touch shot into the roof of the net.\nAnd Barrett crashed onto Evans’ flick-on of Pappa’s corner kick, sending it into the back of the net and CenturyLink into bedlam. Barrett shrugged off his teammates, leapt onto the railing near the corner flag and greeted an adoring public.\n“It’s important to get a point, not to walk away with a goose egg,” Seattle coach Sigi Schmid said. “And it’s important (that) everybody in our locker room knows that we’re a team that can come back.” \nPlayoffs chase The Sounders are in a battle for one of the final playoff spots out of the MLS’ Western Conference. The top six teams get in. Team W-L-T Pts L.A.
