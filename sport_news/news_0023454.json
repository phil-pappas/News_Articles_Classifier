Ask the experts! \nJ.T. Barrett, redshirt sophomore quarterback \nOn finding his rhythm \n“I felt good. I thought I found it early. Running the ball helps me get in a rhythm.”\n \nChris Worley, sophomore linebacker \nOn being prepared \n“The big thing coaches preach here is that the next guy has to be ready. You saw it last year with J.T. replacing Braxton and it just happened a lot today on defense.”\nOn his role within the team \n“It means a lot. Guys here have to battle every day to get on the field. All I try to do is go hard every day and it’s paying off which means a lot.”\n\n\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nTommy Schutt, senior defensive lineman \nOn the defensive line’s performance \n“I thought we did a good job of getting after the quarterback today. He’s a great player and really does a good job of staying in the pocket and holding onto the ball. At times we were able to get after him, especially in the fourth quarter.”\nOn rushing the quarterback \n“After we got to him a couple times you could see that he had ‘happy feet’ and was quicker to get the ball away or run.”\n \nVonn Bell, junior defensive back \nOn Joshua Perry’s injury and its effect on the team \n“He’s a leader [and] a brother. We look up to him. But those guys who stepped in played well, they were the next guys up and they were prepared for it. They came in with confidence and we gathered around each other and held each other accountable and played football.”\n \n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \n  Taylor Decker, senior offensive lineman \nOn the Penn State defense \n“We knew going into this game, top-to-bottom this was going to be one of the best defensives we’ve faced so far this season. Good players, slippery, and they can get off blocks, but if we could get our double team going we were able to move them. That’s where some of the success in our run game came from.”\nOn J.T. Barrett’s response in the offense \n“That’s kind of the way it happened last year - he had a little adversity to go through and he came in and did a great job for us. He was awesome in the read-option of course. No matter what happens he’s going to be ready to go and play and perform.”\nOn the different offensive looks with Barrett and Jones \n“Yes [the offense feels different depending on the starter]. J.T. does a really good job with the read option, we don’t do as much of that with Cardale. Cardale obviously has the downfield threat. They both have their strengths, they both have weaknesses. whoever is in there, we just have to do our job.”\n \nCameron Johnston, junior punter \nOn the game atmosphere \n“The atmosphere is so much better [at night]. Seeing the black-out tonight, the way the fans are, it was a great atmosphere. We realized how crazy it was.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:35:58.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
