However, the Giants, unsure of how effective Pierre-Paul will be on the field once he returns, are unlikely to pay Pierre-Paul a prorated amount of that tender. \nInstead, they should seek to give Pierre-Paul a much smaller, likely incentive-laden deal. Pierre-Paul's full tender pays him roughly $871,000 for each week of the season; if he were to sign this week, he would be due about $8.71 million. That is a large price for a player coming off a traumatic injury that could have a significant impact on how he plays the game. \nSince Pierre-Paul is technically a free agent, the Giants and his camp would have to negotiate any change in compensation, which could drag out the process further. This is Pierre-Paul's second visit as a free agent, the last allowed by NFL bylaws. He has until Nov. 17 to sign with the Giants, otherwise he will be ineligible to play during the 2015 season per conditions of the franchise tender system. \nAnd even if Pierre-Paul's hand checks out and he reaches an agreement with the team, then comes the real questions: Can he still play? Will he be anywhere near as productive after such severe injuries? How quickly can he get in game shape and on the field? \nGiants coach Tom Coughlin told reporters earlier Monday that, \"to my knowledge, he's not here at this point in time. When he does, we'll let you know. And it's all going to start with the medical (process).\" \nThose comments came a few days after Coughlin said \" I wish I knew \" when asked where Pierre-Paul stood. But, it now appears an answer is coming in the immediate future. What the answer is, though, remains unknown. \nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below. Follow him on Twitter @JamesKratch .
