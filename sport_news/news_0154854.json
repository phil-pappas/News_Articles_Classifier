(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Sponsored Links \nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell expects NFL owners will vote on franchise relocation to Los Angeles. \nWhen is another matter. \nGoodell said Wednesday the owners expressed interest \"in wanting to be there, but also recognize we need to find solutions. Our relocation policy is very important.\" \nThe St. Louis Rams, Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers all have designs on moving to LA, which has not had an NFL franchise since 1995, when the Rams and Raiders left. The current timetable calls for submission of applications to relocate in January, when the owners could vote. \nThere has been speculation that timetable could be moved up to December, when the next owners meeting occurs in Dallas. But Pittsburgh Steelers President Art Rooney said he doesn't envision that. \n\"I don't think we'll move up the deadline,\" Rooney said. \"We have cities that still are putting together their proposals\" to keep their teams. \nEric Grubman, the league's main point man on Los Angeles, added that the NFL is not married to a vote in January, either, and that it could come later, particularly if one of the applicants is in the playoffs. \n\"Our timeline and planning for at least 12 months has been to enable a January decision,\" Grubman said. \"But we have never committed to January. Today we continued on that path. ... It could be January or it could be later.\" \nGrubman admitted for a team or two to call LA home next season, the latest it could get approval would probably be March or April. \n\"If you look at it through what a club has to do if they're not certain they're going to Los Angeles, do they put their tickets on sale or not, then January is much much better than March,\" he said. \nThe Rams are proposing a stadium in Inglewood, California, while the Raiders and Chargers have one planned for Carson. Those teams' owners were excused from a round table session during Wednesday's fall meetings, and the other 29 owners voiced their opinions on approving any moves to LA. \nGoodell said it's \"very positive\" to have two alternatives in what he also called \"the entertainment capital of the world.\" \nNeither California team has had success in getting public funding for a new stadium; Goodell noted that has been happening \"for decades.\" Missouri has come through with a plan for a $1 billion stadium to keep the Rams, but there are delays in that proposal. \n___ \nAP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this story. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WFTV Morning News Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:57:44.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
