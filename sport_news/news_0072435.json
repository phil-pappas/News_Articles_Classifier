At 42, Vinatieri is the Colts' oldest player.Backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, 40, started in place of Luck and completed 30 of 47 passes for 282 yards, a touchdown and no interceptions.Hasselbeck's 28-yard pass to tight end Coby Fleener -- just after Jaguars' kicker Jason Myers was wide left on a 48-yard field goal that would have won it with 8:13 left -- moved the Colts into scoring position.Running back Frank Gore's 22-yard run set up Vinatieri's final kick.Jacksonville (1-3) had an opportunity to win with one second remaining in regulation, but Myers' 53-yard field goal attempt was just wide right, forcing overtime.The Colts wasted a golden scoring opportunity with 8:19 left in the fourth quarter when Gore fumbled at the Jaguars' 5-yard line, and defensive tackle Abry Jones recovered in the end zone. The fumble was forced by reserve safety Josh Evans and was the second by Gore coughed up in the opposing end zone this season.Indianapolis tied it at 13 with 12:27 to go on Vinatieri's 32-yard field goal after the Colts drove 35 yards in eight plays for the second half's first score.Jacksonville took a 13-10 halftime lead when Myers kicked a 32-yard field goal with four seconds remaining in the second quarter, capping a 14-play, 65-yard drive that included a 19-yard pass from Blake Bortles to wide receiver Allen Hurns to the Colts' 16.Indianapolis had pulled even at 10 with 6:04 left in the half on Hasselbeck's 2-yard touchdown pass to Fleener. That 13-play, 80-yard drive included five Jaguars' penalties - two pass interference calls, a roughing the passer, a personal foul and an illegal substitution.Bortles 8-yard TD pass to Hurns with 11:37 remaining in the half pushed Jacksonville into a 10-3 lead, capping a 49-yard drive after strong safety Johnathan Cyprien recovered a fumble by Indianapolis running back Josh Robinson. The fumble was caused by linebacker Dan Skuta.Each team kicked a first-quarter field goal - Vinatieri hitting from 54 yards with 4:59 left in the period and Myers from 20 yards at the 2:49 mark after Bortles completed passes of 26 and 48 yards.Jacksonville out gained Indianapolis 210-118 during the opening 30 minutes when Bortles was 14 of 18 for 179 yards and no interceptions. Hasselbeck completed 12 of 21 for 110 yards in the first two quarters.The Colts' 12 first half rushing attempts produced eight yards.NOTES: Colts reserve CB Jalil Brown suffered groin injury in the first half and did not return ... Jaguars MLB Paul Posluszny, who made five first-half tackles, left the game with an ankle injury in the third quarter and did not return ...

Freeman fuels Falcons in win over Houston \nSuperstar receiver Julio Jones stood on the sideline with his helmet off for most of the second half. The surprising Atlanta Falcons didn't need him.Devonta Freeman scored three touchdowns for a second straight game, fueling the Falcons' 48-21 rout of the Houston Texans on Sunday at the Georgia Dome. Jets down Dolphins in London \nThe bye week might hold a double meaning for the Miami Dolphins, but coach Joe Phibin said Sunday it's no time to panic.\"It all seems like the walls are closing in on you. We all realize that. So we gotta look at things and be honest about where we are, what we're doing well and what we're not doing well,\" he said.Philbin and his top lieutenants, defensive coordinator Frank Coyle and offensive coordinator Bill Lazor, are under fire in the wake of a third consecutive loss, the latest a 27-14 whipping at the hands of the New York Jets at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.\"I told the team look, I expected to be better than 1-3, (owner) Steve (Ross) expected to be better than 1-3, you expected to be better than 1-3. That's what we are,\" Philbin said. \"There's an old saying in football, you are what you are.\"Jets running back Chris Ivory Ivory ran for a career-high 166 yards and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick passed for 218 yards and one touchdown.Philbin was hired entering the 2012 season, leaving the Green Bay Packers and edging then-Dolphins interim head coach Todd Bowles in the interview process. Bowles is 3-1 with the Jets in his first season as a permanent head coach.\"I was proud of them,\" Bowles said of the Jets. The Dolphins do not play in Week 5 but return to the United States on Sunday night with plenty of baggage and loads of questions. They've lost to the Jaguars, Bills and Jets since holding off the Washington Redskins on the final possession of the fourth quarter to win 17-10 in Week 1.Philbin said that after speaking with owner Stephen Ross, he's not concerned about his own future and has no plans to part with Coyle.\"I'm worried about getting our team fixed and straightened out and ready to play the Tennessee Titans. We have 14 days,\" Philbin said.Fitzpatrick, who threw for 172 yards in the first half, connected on a 58-yard completion to wide receiver Brandon Marshall on the first play. Marshall had 107 yards receiving by halftime and finished with 128 on seven receptions for the Jets (3-1). Fitzpatrick was 16-of-29 passing and had one interception. Anxious feelings persist because of continued problems generating yards (241 Sunday) on offense and little impact from $114 million free agent big fish Ndamukong Suh. Ivory scored the first touchdown from 3 yards to start off his ninth career 100-yard game. Fitzpatrick later completed a 10-yard TD pass to wide receiver Eric Decker in the second quarter and running back Zac Stacy scored from the 2 in the third.\"Through four games, I'm happy,\" Bowles said. \"For 16 games ... we'll see.\"The Dolphins sputtered from the start on offense as Bowles called a bevy of blitzes -- at least 22 times in the game he sent an extra pass rusher -- to overwhelm Miami's undermanned offensive line playing again without left tackle Branden Albert.The Jets finished with 207 yards rushing, including 34 from Fitzpatrick, and 425 total yards on offense.Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill ended up with 198 yards and two touchdowns on 19-of-44 passing.The Dolphins were 0-for-12 on third downs and 0-for-4 on fourth downs.NOTES: Sunday's game was the 12th regular-season game at Wembley Stadium, but the first intra-divisional game. ... Jets DL Leonard Williams (ankle) will not likely practice Tuesday before the team gets a week off during its bye, but coach Todd Bowles did not believe the injury to be serious. ... Jets S Calvin Pryor is dealing with a knee \"bone contusion\" per Bowles and will be re-evaluated this week. ... Suspended DT Sheldon Richardson can return to the team from a four-game ban on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:07:00.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
