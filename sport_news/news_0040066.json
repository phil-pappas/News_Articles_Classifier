(AP) - Michigan is close to joining other states that ban a powder product that makes vodka, rum and other alcoholic drinks when mixed with water.\nPowdered alcohol apparently is not widely available in Michigan yet. Lawmakers are taking steps to make sure it never is.\nThe House on Tuesday is expected to pass legislation and send it to Gov. Rick Snyder for his signature.\nThe bill would prohibit the sale, use or possession of powdered alcohol.\nThe legislation's supporters say that the product is safe and opens the door to more underage drinking. Creators of the product have said it is no more dangerous that traditional liquid alcohol.\nThe product has won federal approval, and states have been moving quickly to prohibit it.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Lansing1WEB.jpg", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*197/Lansing1WEB.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:05:12.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
