The Mamta Modern boys scored through Abhishek early in the match and then stoutly defended their citadel from falling to earn full points.\nSimilarly, the Indian Railways boys can also take heart from the fact that they managed to post a 1-0 win over Sainik School from Uttarakhand.\nIn another low-scoring match, Army Boys Sports Company managed a 1-0 win over Kerala's MSP Higher Secondary School from Mallapuram. It was an upset of sorts, considering that the Kerala boys had lifted the title last year and were expected to win against the Shillong outfit.\nSurprisingly, St Xavier's School, who lost to Pool A leader Army Boys yesterday, beat Rani Seethai Aachi Higher Secondary School from Cuddalore (Tamil Nadu) 2-0 while Bangladesh school lost 0-1 to Little Angels Pradise School from Wangbal (Manipur) in pool B.\nComing to high-scoring matches, Meghalaya's Mawsura RC Upper Primary School beat Daman and Diu 11-0 in pool D. With no efforts coming from the Moti Daman side, the Meghalaya boys were swarming all over and scoring at will.\nIn pool C, Sports Authority of India, Salt Lake, redeemed themselves with a 3-1 win over the Maharashtra school.\nIn a clash of northeastern teams, Assam's Betkuchi School boys thrashed Sikkim's Central Pendam Senior Secondary School 7-0 in another pool C match.\nOdisha's Town High School (Sundargarh) beat Shri Ram school 8-1 and the worse performance came from the Car Nicobar team, Government Senior Secondary School from Malacca as they lost 1-14 to Mizoram's Government Bazaar High School, Lunglei.
