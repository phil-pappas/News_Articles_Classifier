He said he was making progress in his recovery from the left hamstring injury before Buffalo's Week 3 game against the Miami Dolphins, but hurt it again on Sept. 24. McCoy attempted to play through the injury in Buffalo's 41-14 win over the Dolphins but ran for just 16 yards on 11 carries.\n\"After (Week 2 against New England) I was getting better, feeling better,\" McCoy said. \"And then that Thursday I kind of hurt it again and that's where it went wrong. I tried to really push it. I guess I messed something up.\"\nMcCoy originally injured his hamstring at a training camp practice on Aug. 18.\nThe 5-foot-11, 208-pound running back is known for his speed and cutting ability, which is compromised by the injury.\n\"I'm not the bruising type to be running through everybody,\" McCoy said. \"My thing is making them miss and getting out of there. If you can't do that, you can't do (anything).\"\nMcCoy did not rule out missing more time and said he will wait to return until he is fully healthy.\n\"One thing I just promised myself is I can't go out there if I'm not 100 percent,\" McCoy said. \"Whatever it is, I'm rushing to get back, but I'm not playing until I'm 100 percent.\"\nThe Bills have high hopes for McCoy after acquiring the running back this offseason in a trade with the Philadelphia Eagles. Through three games, he has 43 carries for 146 yards.\nBuffalo has a capable replacement at running back in rookie Karlos Williams. The fifth-round pick has been a pleasant surprise with 186 yards and three touchdowns to begin the season, along with an average of 7.8 yards per carry.\nReceiver Sammy Watkins (calf), guard John Miller (groin), safety Aaron Williams (neck) and receiver Marquise Goodwin (ribs) have also been ruled out for Sunday's game against the New York Giants.\nWith numbers low at running back, the Bills promoted Cierre Wood from the practice squad to the active roster Friday afternoon. The 5-foot-11, 213-pound running back has played in five career games. He entered the league as an undrafted free agent with the Houston Texans in 2013.\nTo make room for Wood, the Bills released defensive tackle Andre Fluellen.\nReceiver Sammy Watkins (calf), guard John Miller (groin), safety Aaron Williams (neck) and receiver Marquise Goodwin (ribs) have also been ruled out for Sunday's game against the New York Giants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:48:54.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
