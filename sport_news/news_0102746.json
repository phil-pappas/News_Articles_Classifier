No. 17 Dodge City (6-2, 4-1) will square off with a familiar opponent on Monday when they travel to Sterling. The Conquistadors scrimmaged against Sterling JV back in August before their first game of the season. Even though the two teams lined up against each other earlier this year, this game it will count towards the Conqs’ record. In the scrimmage earlier this season, Dodge City’s starters played only about a dozen snaps against the Sterling staters. \"We’re pretty confident,\" head coach Gary Thomas said. \"We know how they are going to line up. They played Hutch earlier in the year so we have that film as well. I can’t imagine that they are just going to show up in a new offense and a new defense.\" With the Conqs not playing until Monday, the schedule has looked a little different for the players and coaches. Dodge City had their first practice of the week on Friday. While the extra rest will help the Conqs recover, Thomas hopes that it did not disrupt the players’ routine in a negative way. \"It’s always tricky when you give them too much time off,\" Thomas said. \"They get out of the schedule. The routine is what keeps us going strong and we’ve broken the routine now. It’s going to be a challenge to see where their heads are at.\" Following the game at Sterling on Monday, the Conqs will have a short week to prepare for No. 4 Coffeyville. The schedule may have given the Dodge City players some extra rest but if the Conqs want to win their seventh game of the season for the first time since 2005, they will have to take care of business at the start of the week. \"We’re going to have to bring our best effort on Monday,\" Thomas said. \"It’s not a bye week by any stretch of the imagination. We’ve got to be good blocking, tackling and we’ve got to be where we are supposed to be. We’ve got to make plays. If we can do those things we’ll be okay.\" Kickoff is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Sterling College.
