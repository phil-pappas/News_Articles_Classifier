The Tigers, who defeated East St. Louis via forfeit Friday, took over sole possession of first place in the Southwestern Conference with Belleville East’s 25-21 victory over Belleville West on Saturday. Edwardsville, at 6-0 overall and 4-0 in the SWC, is the lone league team unbeaten. Belleville West and Belleville East are both 3-1 in the conference in second place. On Saturday, Belleville East got off to a quick start with Isaiah King hauling in a 26-yard touchdown pass from Drew Millas for the 6-0 lead. After West took a 7-6 lead on TeAntez Anthony’s 72-yard touchdown reception from Logan Betz, the Lancers picked up three straight field goals from Matt Sotiropoulos, including a 53-yarder and 43-yarder. Connor Marin then caught a 15-yard touchdown pass from Milas to open up the fourth quarter and a fourth field goal from Sotiropoulos opened up the lead to 25-7. The Maroons scored two touchdowns in the final three minutes, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the leg of Sotiropoulos. Millas finished 12 of 28 for 146 yards and two touchdowns for the Lancers, while Moses Holman added 82 yards on the ground. Betz, who had a rushing touchdown, was 23 of 38 from 337 yards and two touchdowns for West. Anthony had nine receptions for 208 yards and two touchdowns. The Maroons will host Edwardsville at 7 p.m. Friday. O’FALLON CRUSHES GRANITE CITY — A week after running for 294 yards and four touchdowns in a win over Alton, O’Fallon running back Kentrail Moran finished with 139 rushing yards and two touchdowns to lead the Panthers over Granite City. Host O’Fallon scored 36 unanswered points and cruised to a 42-12 victory over Granite City. After starting the season 0-4, the Panthers have won two straight and are now 2-2 in the SWC. Granite City, which is 2-4 overall, is 0-2 in league action. The Warriors stayed with the Panthers early, getting touchdown runs from Ronald Allen and Gabe Jarman to take a 12-7 lead. O’Fallon took over after that, getting two late first-half touchdowns from Mason Hewitt on the ground and Deion Norfleet through the air to go up 21-7 at halftime. The lead grew to 35-7 after three quarters, with Aaron Smith catching a 21-yard touchdown pass and Moran running one in from seven yards out. O’Fallon added a touchdown in the fourth quarter to put the game well out of reach. Christian Perez was efficient for the Panthers, going 7 of 11 for 122 yards and two touchdowns. ALTON REMAINS WINLESS — Collinsville won its second straight game as the host Kahoks defeated Alton 34-9 on Friday. The Redbirds, now 0-6 overall and 0-4 in the SWC, trailed just 14-9 late in the second quarter when they blocked a Collinsville field-goal attempt. Holder and Kahok quarterback Joran Reichert, though, scooped up the loose ball and ran 20 yards for a touchdown to extend the lead to 21-9. The Kahoks scored 13 more points in the second half, including a 71-yard touchdown run from Max Lyons. Lyons led the Kahoks with 123 rushing yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:40:32.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
