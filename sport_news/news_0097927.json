They open a four-game series at home Thursday against the Los Angeles Angels. Adrian Beltre hit the first of three Texas home runs. \nRobinson Chirinos and Mike Napoli also went deep for the Rangers. \nYovani Gallardo (13-11) allowed nine hits over 5 1-3 innings, but gave up only two runs to win for the first time in his last four starts. The right-hander struck out five and walked one. \n\"We put up some hits. We just didn't put up runs,\" Ausmus said. \"We didn't get the big hit, the home run or the extra-base hit with runners on that push you over the edge.\" \nDetroit took a 2-0 lead in the first inning for the second night in a row, this time on a two-run double by Tyler Collins. \nTigers left-hander Matt Boyd (1-6) allowed all three Texas homers while giving up seven hits in 2 2-3 innings. He struck out two and walked one. \n\"My changeup usually doesn't get hit that hard. It wasn't the only thing that was hit,\" Boyd said. \"I wasn't really staying with my delivery. Didn't have the rhythm like I've the past three outings.\" \nTexas got even in the bottom of the first on Beltre's 17th homer, a shot to left-center field. Beltre has an AL-best 29 RBIs in September, and 74 for the season. \nChirinos led off the second with his 10th homer, putting Texas ahead to stay. Beltre had a two-out double off the left-center wall and scored on Prince Fielder's bloop single before Napoli hit a blast to the wall behind the lower deck of seats in left field. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nTigers: Victor Martinez missed his second consecutive game with a sore left quad. ... 3B Nick Castellanos was back in the lineup after coming out in the first inning Tuesday because of a bruised right finger and sore left wrist. \nRangers: C Robinson Chirinos made only his second start since being activated from the disabled list Sept. 7 after missing more than a month with a left shoulder strain. \nUP NEXT \nTigers: After its final off day of the season, Detroit opens a three-game series Friday night at the Chicago White Sox. \nRangers: LHP Derek Holland, 0-2 with an 8.59 ERA his last four starts, pitches the series opener against the Angels. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:46:22.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
