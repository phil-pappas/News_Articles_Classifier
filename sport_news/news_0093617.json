October 26, 2015 0 0 \nGlen Rice Jr., the son of former NBA All-Star Glen Rice, was reportedly shot in the leg Sunday at a restaurant in downtown Atlanta. \nAccording to WTOC in Atlanta, police say Rice was involved in a fight with four or five people at Scales 925 when an employee asked them to leave. The altercation continued in the parking lot, at which point Rice was shot in the leg and tried to flee the scene. \nPolice allegedly have video showing Rice dumping a revolver around a staircase near the restaurant before getting into a Porsche with another man. The driver dropped Rice off at a local hospital and he got out and laid on the ground outside the emergency room. Officers later pulled the car over and seized 240 grams of marijuana (almost a half-pound) and $5,900 cash and the gun. They also recovered the gun, and the serial number on the revolver reportedly revealed that it had been stolen. \nTMZ reports that Rice has been charged with reckless conduct and possession of marijuana . The site also notes that the restaurant where the altercation began is owned by rapper T.I. \nRice was drafted by the Washington Wizards in the second round of the 2013 NBA Draft. He has bounced around in the D-League since then. Rice’s story doesn’t really compare to the last one we shared with you about his dad , but it is pretty alarming nonetheless. \nPhoto: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:03:23.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
