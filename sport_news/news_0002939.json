Posted Sep. 30, 2015 at 6:16 PM Updated at 6:19 PM Posted Sep. 30, 2015 at 6:16 PM Updated at 6:19 PM PANAMA CITY — It was a last-minute effort, but several students made alterations to their parade floats before the Bay High School 65th homecoming parade Wednesday. Senior Caycie Taylor supervised her fellow Science Club members, who were hurriedly taping silver panels around the float they affectionately dubbed “Chrome City.” Each of Bay High’s clubs was tasked with promoting a different time period and the Science Club drew the future. “I think it will turn out OK,” Taylor said. “This is my senior year and I’ve never been part of a float. I think it will be fun.” Juniors Laura-Anne Kinch and Aida Torres were dressed festively in all types of hippie gear — leather fringe, colored sunglasses and tie-dye, for example — to represent their float for the National Honor Society. “I’ve been excited all week,” Torres said. Bay High’s first official homecoming dates back to 1950, according to Bay County Library Local History Department. This year, school floats, some carting football players clad in bright red jerseys, were just one part of the parade. Members of the homecoming court top 10 rode in vintage cars — most Chevrolets from 1955 to 1957 — provided by County Commissioner and dealership owner George Gainer. School Board members Jerry Register and Joe Wayne Walker also were in a car, celebrating the 50th reunion for the class of 1965. “You combine the football team and one of the best music departments in the state and they’re quite special,” Register said. There was a particular buzz about Bay High’s football team this year. The Tornadoes were ranked ninth in 5A last week. “We’re on fire,” senior Madison Blackburn said. “I knew we would have a lot of potential because they were junior stacked” last year. Spectators lined up along Harrison Avenue after lunch, including Annie Velasquez with children Skylar Mayo, 10, Dylan Fortier, 7, Thomas Fortier, 4, and Kevin Velasquez, 3. They were supporting Velasquez’s eighth-grade daughter in the Color Guard. Cyndee Nigro and Tom Frowert were seated just a little farther north to support Nigro’s daughter, Kristen Grantcharov, who was among the top 10 court finalists. “It’s a great way to remember senior year,” Grantcharov said. The homecoming king and queen will be announced Friday at the football game against Pensacola High.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:33:22.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
