Quarterback Justin Essex threw a pass to receiver Keith Corbin in the end zone, but pass interference was called, putting the ball at the La Porte 4 . Kicker Missial Tovar came on to attempt a 21-yard field goal to force overtime, but the kick sailed to the right to keep the Bulldogs undefeated in district. \nIt was Tovar's second field goal miss of the game, missing a 31-yard attempt in the second quarter. \n\"There's no way to compare an offensive play from the 4-yard line from a field goal, but the odds are astronomically better to kick,\" West Brook coach Kevin Flanigan said. \"So we played the odds and yeah, it's hindsight to go for it. But we don't get to make that second choice. So it is what it is.\" \nTURNING POINT: La Porte took the lead for good midway in the fourth quarter as quarterback Austin Upshaw scored from a yard out with 4:48 left in the game. A 49-yard run by Upshaw put the ball deep in Bruin territory at the beginning of the game-winning drive. \nUpshaw ran for 183 yards on 29 carries for the Bulldogs, while running back Cobra Davis had 64 yards rushing, including a 38-yard touchdown that put La Porte ahead early in the third quarter. \n\"(Upshaw) is a good one, we face him all the time,\" Flanigan said. \"Everyone has a big-time D-1 guy and he's going to be at that level too.\" \nMOST-SPECTACULAR PLAY: On the game's second play from scrimmage, West Brook running back Joel Denly raced 67 yards for the Bruins' first score of the game. But Denly, who had 98 yards rushing, was injured in the second quarter and did not return. \nIn his place, sophomore running back James Jones did well by rushing for 115 yards, including a 52-yard touchdown run that gave the Bruins a 13-10 halftime lead. \nBY THE NUMBERS: Essex was 13-of-24 for 193 yards, but Corbin – West Brook's leading receiver going into the game – only had three catches for 62 yards. \nHE SAID IT: \"Our team has to get better and that's the bottom line,\" Flanigan said. \"We only can control what we do, so we have to go into the game and get better.\" \nRECORDS: West Brook 6-3, 3-2. La Porte 7-1, 4-0. \nNEXT UP: West Brook plays host to Port Arthur Memorial Friday. La Porte plays at Galena Park North Shore.
