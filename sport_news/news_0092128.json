Having said that, Chris is a contracted player,” Silvagni told Trade Radio on Wednesday. \n“I’ve spoken to Richmond this afternoon and they’re still working through a few things and hopefully we can come to a solution. \n“I think we made it really clear to (them) some time ago that an end-of-first-round pick wouldn’t get it done and they were well aware of that.” \nThe Tigers have offered up No.19, a pick they landed for their part in brokering Charlie Dixon’s move from Gold Coast to Port Adelaide, to no avail. \nJames Aish’s proposed move from Brisbane to Collingwood is another big-ticket deal that remains up in the air as the trade clock counts down. \nThe Magpies have been focused on landing GWS midfielder Adam Treloar, but that trade was done late on Wednesday, which should allow Collingwood to find a way to satisfy the Lions. \nTreloar’s move was one of eight deals done on the penultimate day of the AFL trade window. \nJake Carlisle finally made his long-anticipated switch from Essendon to St Kilda, while the Blues sent fan favourite Troy Menzel to Adelaide, while welcoming Sam Kerridge in return from the Crows, with Lachie Plowman, Jed Lamb, Andrew Phillips and Liam Sumner arriving from the Giants in a separate deal. \nMelbourne finished the day with GWS midfielder Tomas Bugg and picks three and seven after some shrewd work behind the scenes, while veteran West Coast onballer Matt Rosa crossed the country to join Gold Coast, with the Suns sending pick 31 the other way.
