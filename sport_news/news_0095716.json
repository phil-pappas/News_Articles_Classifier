It’s something very obvious.” \nOn a day when 14 of the world’s top 17 players were playing, Andy Murray saved all seven break points he faced and held on to beat big-serving John Isner 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-4; Rafael Nadal defeated Canada’s Milos Raonic 6-3, 7-6 (3); and Stan Wawrinka topped Marin Cilic 7-5, 6-7 (7), 6-4. \nSixth-seeded Kei Nishikori of Japan, meanwhile, was upset by South Africa’s Kevin Anderson 7-6 (10), 7-6 (3). \nLopez, who lost to Djokovic in the quarterfinals of last month’s U.S. Open, tried to disrupt the Serbian star’s rhythm by serving and volleying and using a variety of drop shots, sliced backhands and sharp angles. \nDjokovic, however, played a superb defensive game and continually scrambled after Lopez’s shots for winners. During one point in the second set, Lopez chased down a volley and hit an angled shot around the post into the open court only to watch Djokovic stab at the ball and float a lob over his head that dropped on the line. \nAfter the match, the Serbian player said that even though he’s been winning so convincingly in China, he still sees room for improvement. \n“I still believe there are shots in my game that can be better,” he said. “I think that’s one of the things that keeps me going. It motivates me to play more.” \nMurray had won all four of his previous encounters with Isner, but they all went to three sets – and this one was no different. \nIsner had multiple break chances in the match, including two when Murray was serving for the second set. The Scot saved the first break point with a drop shot and the second with a second-serve ace up the middle that caught Isner flat-footed. The American was so angry, he ripped off his hat and flung it to the ground. \nIt was his ninth straight loss to top-10 opponents. \n“It’s disappointing because I did have some chances and I didn’t take them,” Isner said. “If I want to take that next step, I’ve got to do that, and I didn’t. And it’s happened a lot.” \nNadal also had a lengthy losing streak against elite players, but he managed to turn his around against the ninth-seeded Raonic. He had lost his last five matches – and 11 straight sets – to top-10 opponents going back to May. \n“Today I feel that I am not playing with the nerves when I am on court,” Nadal said. “I am able to enjoy.” \nIn other matches, Tomas Berdych defeated Gilles Simon, last year’s Shanghai runner-up, 6-3, 6-3; and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga advanced with a 6-7 (5), 7-5, 6-4 win over Spanish qualifier Albert Ramos-Vinolas, who ousted Roger Federer in the second round. Wozniacki beaten by Flipkens, joins exodus of seeds in Linz \nLINZ, Austria – Caroline Wozniacki became the latest seeded player to suffer an early exit at the Generali Ladies, losing to Belgium’s Kirsten Flipkens 6-4, 6-4 in the second round on Thursday. \nWozniacki’s defeat left the Austrian indoor event without any of its top-six seeded women in the quarterfinals. \nThe 11th-ranked Wozniacki, who was seeded second, struggled to find rhythm against Flipkens, who played more aggressively and alternated strong forehands with dropshot backhands. \n“I have played incredibly well,” Flipkens said. “I was injured after the U.S. Open and to come back and beat Caroline this way, you have to play your best tennis. Everything I did turned out to be good.” \nFlipkens next takes on Denisa Allertova, who defeated fellow Czech player Barbora Strycova 7-6 (0), 5-7, 6-4 in two hours, 46 minutes. \nAllertova, who reached the final in Guangzhou last month, broke the eighth-seeded Strycova’s serve six times in total but missed 15 more break points. \nSeventh-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova became the highest ranked player left after defeating Stefanie Voegele of Switzerland 6-4, 6-0. \nThe 29th-ranked Russian was broken when serving for the first set at 5-2 before taking seven straight games to close out the win. \nIn her sixth semifinal of the season, Pavlyuchenkova will play 99th-ranked Serbian qualifier Aleksandra Krunic, who beat Mona Barthel of Germany 7-6 (6), 6-3. \nAlso, Johanna Larsson of Sweden advanced to the quarterfinals by defeating Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium 6-4, 7-6 (2). \nThe 59th-ranked Larsson rallied from 4-2 down to take the opening set. She saved a set point at 5-4 in the second before wrapping up the win on her third match point. Radwanska reaches quarterfinals of Tianjin Open \nTIANJIN, China – Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland beat China’s Wang Qiang 6-1, 6-1 Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the Tianjin Open. \nThe second-seeded Radwanska saved all five break points she faced and won in just under an hour. \nAlso, Montenegro’s Danka Kovinic upset sixth-seeded Teliana Pereira 6-2, 5-7, 6-1, Elizaveta Kulichkova of Russia defeated countrywoman Evgeniya Rodina 6-2, 7-5, and Tianjin native Duan Ying-Ying beat Lyudmyla Kichenok of Ukraine 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4. \n© Copyright 2015 Associated Press.
