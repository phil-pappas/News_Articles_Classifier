He walked one, struck out two and allowed three home runs. \nThe first was to Adrian Beltre. It was a two-run shot to leftfield. \nThe second was to Robinson Chirinos. It was a solo shot to left-centerfield. \nThe third was to Mike Napoli, a two-run shot to leftfield and one batter later, after a Mitch Moreland single, Boyd's night was no more after 69 pitches. \nLike Tuesday night, the Tigers took a two-run lead in the top of the first inning, when Tyler Collins hit a two-run single. \nThey were the only runs the Tigers would plate, as Rangers right-hander Yovani Gallardo settled from there, allowing nine hits over 5 1/3 innings. He struck out five and walked one. \nThe Tigers out-hit the Rangers, 12-9, but could not muster a run on two hits in 3 2/3 innings against their bullpen. \nJ.D. Martinez went 3-for-4 and Rajai Davis, Ian Kinsler and Nick Castellanos each had two hits. \nWith the win, the Rangers' magic number in the American League West fell to two. With the loss, the Tigers remain in last place in the Central. \nContact Anthony Fenech: afenech@freepress.com . Follow him on Twitter @anthonyfenech .
