Dion Lewis . An absolute scrap-heap back out of Pittsburgh -- Lewis had 33 career carries before this season -- he's turned into the latest versatile weapon in Brady's arsenal. His middle name might be \"Wiggle.\" \nNew England gets the Colts next week in an all-time revenge game. Seeing anything other than Brady and Bill Belichick hang a 50-burger on Indy in the dome would be a shock. Unless it was a 60-burger. \n3. Philly's rise: Wait a minute. You're telling me the Eagles weren't going to be terrible all season? No way. Although it's far too early to go out here and crown Chip Kelly after one good outing. \nBut there's good news here on a couple of levels: \nSam Bradford was accurate : Bradford completed over 70 percent of his passes and pushed the ball down the field more aggressively than he has most of the season. He utilized a slew of different receivers including Josh Huff five targets, four catches, 78 yards, one TD), Zach Ertz seven targets, five catches, 60 yards), Brent Celek three targets, three catches, 44 yards, one TD) and DeMarco Murray eight targets, seven catches, 37 yards). Jordan Matthews five catches, 44 yards) was active, too. \nThe bad news is Bradford threw a pair of inexcusable red-zone interceptions. No one's trying to let him slide on those throws. He's got to clean them up and be smarter with the football. But he's new to this system, too. And he looked more comfortable on Sunday. \nThe run game lives : Murray is the biggest revelation here. He ran well, both out of the shotgun and from under center, the latter of which Philly made a clear effort to utilize more early on. \nThe @Eagles had their way in a 39-17 win vs. the Saints today. THIS DeMarco Murray TD was the cherry on top #NOvsPHI — NFL (@NFL) \nThe Saints might just be terrible and none of this might be worth anything. But the Eagles clearly looked better in Week 5. Remember: Teams aren't defined by four weeks of football. The Patriots were terrible last year and grew into a Super Bowl champion. \nPhilly has a very nice schedule the next six weeks, including a bye before the Cowboys and the Buccaneers/Dolphins at home. It wouldn't be surprising to see them get hot. \n4. No one knows what a catch is, Part XLVIII: The lack of understanding what is a catch is beyond me. I get the idea that a receiver going into the end zone must possess the ball all the way to the ground and not lose control. \nBut common sense should take over at some point. To wit: Devonta Freeman whose been UNREAL the last three weeks) caught a pass late for the Falcons, turned toward the goal line and dived into the end zone. \nTo repeat: the picture below (via Twitter) you are about to see is NOT a touchdown. \nIn what world does this make sense? Freeman isn't down on the ground, he's reaching out to put the ball across the end zone, he's broken the plane of the end zone and it sure looks like a touchdown. If he was a runner it would be a touchdown. But because he's a receiver it's not. Silly stuff. \n5. Gurley man: The Rams lost Sunday and managed to make Aaron Rodgers look human in Green Bay, with the Packers quarterback throwing not one but two interceptions, his first in more than 1,043 days . (It was also just the second time in his career Rodgers threw a pair of picks in the first half of a home game.) \nBut because the Rams couldn't kick and Nick Foles isn't very good -- he threw two picks from the Packers 7-yard line! -- they couldn't keep it close. \nIt's OK. Because many people don't win in Green Bay. And the Rams still have Todd Gurley , who looks like 2015's version of Odell Beckham Jr., albeit as a running back. Gurley continued to flash incredible athletic ability, power, vision and balance. \nGurley carried 30 times for 159 yards, including an impressive 55-yard run. \nTodd Gurley ripped off 159 yards today vs. Green Bay. This one went for 55. It's happening. #STLvsGB — Ballsharks (@Ball_Sharks) \nEverything he does looks absolutely effortless. When he hits the open field, Gurley doesn't even really appear to need an extra gear … he's just going. \nOh, and he can block, too. Dude body-slammed Clay Matthews when the Packers linebacker tried to bust through the line. \nClay Matthews thought he could hurdle and power through Todd Gurley. Bad idea. Very bad idea. #STLvsGB — NFL (@NFL) \nGurley is leading every rookie running back in terms of yardage and he's only played two full weeks. Be afraid, be very afraid. \n6. How now, Mr. McCown: The narrative often causes us to lose track of reality. Josh McCown looks terrible and Johnny Manziel wins a game so we start screaming about playing the young guy. McCown isn't the answer over the long haul, but he's doing some things for Cleveland right now. \nNamely he's chucking the ball all over the place, becoming the first quarterback in Browns history to throw for more than 300 yards in three straight games. McCown went for 341 in Week 3, 356 in Week 4 and went up TOP on the Ravens in Week 5 for 457 yards. \nGoing 1-1 in their last two road games, including a very close loss to the Chargers and a divisional win against the Ravens on the road? The Browns are 2-3 and not making the playoffs but their fans should feel good. \nLeft tackle Joe Thomas at least feels good enough to sling some daggers around. \nWhen asked about #Browns QB Josh McCown's performance, LT Joe Thomas quipped, \"Put in Johnny. That's all I can say.\" — Nate Ulrich (@NateUlrichABJ) October 11, 2015 \n7. Bengals are for real: What a way for Cincinnati to get to 5-0. The Bengals welcomed the defending NFC champion Seahawks to town, spent most of the game getting knocked around and looked like they were dead in the water down 24-7 heading into the fourth quarter. \nAndy Dalton and this offense responded with 17 fourth-quarter points to tie the game in the sort of fashion you'd never expect out of this team. It was a big-stage moment where they got out-physicaled on both sides of the ball. \nWith the score 24-21, Dalton promptly marched the Bengals down in field goal range, scrambled and got CRUSHED by Bruce Irvin , moved his team off the field so Mike Nugent could bang home a field goal as the clock expired despite having no timeouts. \n\"It's a huge win for us. It shows the character of this team, the fight of this team,\" Dalton said. \"And for us to do that against a really, really good team … is huge.\" \nThis shouldn't be a situation where we write off Seattle. The Seahawks are 2-3 but they've won at home and lost on the road to quality teams (Green Bay, Cincy, St. Louis). \nThis game was more about the Bengals and how they're a legitimate contender. Lots of season left and at some point Dalton has to see a little regression. But this is a loaded roster. If Dalton's weapons stay healthy, they're going to be dangerous in January. \nNot something you'd usually say about the Bengals. \n8. Charles Woodson is ageless: Football is a crazy sport, man. Charles Woodson, drafted No. 4 overall in 1998, once beat out Peyton Manning, drafted No. 1 overall in 1998, for the Heisman Trophy. They're both still inexplicably playing in the NFL and yet Woodson, a Hall of Fame defensive back, never intercepted Manning. \nOf course on Sunday he went out and did it, 18 years later. \nCharles Woodson waited 18 years for it...and finally happened: Interception off Peyton Manning! #DENvsOAK — NFL (@NFL) \nBut really, once isn't enough you know? \nHe waited 18 season to do it once The 2nd one was even nicer Charles Woodson PICKS off Peyton Manning x2 #DENvsOAK — NFL (@NFL) \nWoodson is now the only player in NFL history with two interceptions in a single game after the age of 39. His 64 career interceptions are sixth-most ever and the dude doesn't look like he's slowing down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:12:44.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
