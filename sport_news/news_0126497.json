He hoped that the BJP leadership will take action to discipline them.\nGujral termed the Dadri killing as a national shame. \"It is a national shame and every right thinking Indian will condemn it,\" he said.\nThe Rajya Sabha member lamented that the motormouths were not paying heed to even Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nApart from MPs like Sakshi Maharaj, minister of state for culture Mahesh Sharma has generated a spate of headlines by making controversial remarks on a range of issues. The minister toned down after he was cautioned but has since returned to his usual voluble ways. While this has annoyed some of his seniors, there is still no clarity whether the leadership has taken a similar dim view of the remarks of the culture minister who seemed to be making a deliberate effort to ingratiate himself with the hardliners in the party and the larger Sangh parivar.
