By Monday morning, it will be 400 miles east of North Carolina’s Cape Hatteras, and by Tuesday morning it should be about 400 miles east of Cape Cod.\n “It’s missing us,” Simpson said. “Maybe we’ll have a bit of elevated waves, a little bit of rain, but we’re probably having more winds today than we will when it comes closer to us.”\nIf the current predictions hold true, New England will be spared damage the likes of which we last saw with winter storm Juno .\nBut that doesn’t mean we’re completely in the clear.\n“It’ll still cause problems in places that chronically have problems like Sandwich, Scituate, Marshfield, and a few places on the North Shore,” said Rob Thieler, another scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Woods Hole.\nAnother factor that will mitigate the damage is the fact that the storm will pass to the east of this region. The models are currently showing Boston and New England far away from the storm’s good side: the left.\nChris Sherwood, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, explained that if a hurricane makes landfall and you’re on the right side of it, the force of the winds is stronger than they are on the left side.\nThat’s because the hurricane is spinning as it moves forward, and the winds on the right have the added motion of the hurricane to propel them. On the left, the spinning motion is actually working against the direction of the winds, so they aren’t as strong.\n“The worst thing for us is to have the hurricane land a little bit to the west,” Sherwood said. “Because the winds are strongest on the right, and in that case the whole system is moving so fast that it builds a big bulge of water up in front of it, and doesn’t have time to go off to the east. This adds up to a really strong storm surge.”\nBecause the storm will be moving quickly at the point, we’ll likely see just a few hours of rain and heavy wind and rain, Thieler said.\n“I do not anticipate a tremendous about of coastal impact, and what there is will most likely be short,” Thieler said. “This will not be a three day pounding nor’easter. This will be a few hours with a few swells before and few after.”", "external_links": ["https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/02/15/sandwich-reeling-its-beaches-erode-and-storms-ravage-homes/kXxLFIa3qcuaICwcioTEII/story.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:05:12.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
