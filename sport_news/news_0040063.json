(AP) - An appeals court says a drunken woman who sustained a broken hip after repeatedly falling off a chair while in custody can continue her lawsuit alleging two New Jersey police officers failed to exercise reasonable care.\nA lower court had thrown out Linda Leone's suit, saying the Belmar police officers were immune from liability. But the appeals panel found police do no not have blanket immunity.\nLeone claimed she was highly intoxicated after her arrest in 2010. The officers said she fell off the chair several times before she was placed on the floor.\nLeone had no memory of the arrest or falling, but was treated for hip fractures days later.\nBelmar Mayor Matthew Doherty tells the Asbury Park Press (http://on.app.com/1VPdSwm ) the suit is \"completely ridiculous.\"\n___\nInformation from: Asbury Park (N.J.)
