Burlington-Edison (previous rank: 2): Wins over two top-tier teams in a week? Not to mention a win over reigning 2A champ Tumwater in a weekend tournament? Welcome to the top Tigers. \n2. Lynden Christian (previous rank: 1): Once again the Lyncs likely fall short of a Northwest Conference title. The good news is that come playoff time, the 2A teams are out of the picture. \n3. Ferndale (previous rank: 3): The Golden Eagles may have lost a tight one to the Tigers but the schedule lightens up from here on out as the Golden Eagles prepare to face the bigger schools in the postseason. \n4. Anacortes (previous rank: 5): It was a convincing week for the Seahawks. They topped two scrappy teams. The next three games are preparation for Lynden Christian and Sehome. \n5. Sehome (previous rank: 4): Four straight wins probably doesn’t do much to erase the Ferndale loss but a win against Lynden Christian surely would do plenty to boost confidence for the playoffs. \n6. Squalicum (previous rank: 6): Burlington-Edison on Thursday will be a real test for this team. If the Storm can grab a set or two, that will be huge as postseason fast approaches. \n7. Bellingham (previous rank: 7): The Red Raiders have yet to lose three games in a row this year. It looks like that trend should continue the rest of the way, as Bellingham tries to sneak into the playoffs. \n8. Nooksack Valley (previous rank: 8): Three wins in the last four games will be the goal for the Pioneers. If they can do that, Nooksack Valley should be considered a real sneaky team to watch. \n9. Lynden (previous rank: 9): Right now, the Lions are on the oustide looking in at the postseason. With Bellingham, Burlington-Edison and Ferndale coming up, it only gets tougher from here on out. \n10. Meridian (previous rank: 10): Fun fact: If the Trojans win a set, they get a win. The only problem is that it’s only happened three times this season and once in the last seven. \n11. Blaine (previous rank: 11): Wins are always nice and the Borderites got a win last week. But the three top teams in the conference are on the slate still. \n12. Sedro-Woolley (previous rank: 12): The next four games are all within the realm of winnable. Sedro-Woolley is certainly hoping to snag its first W since Sept. 22. \n13. Mount Baker (previous rank: 13): The long season certainly seems much longer when you’re struggling the way the Mountaineers have this season.
