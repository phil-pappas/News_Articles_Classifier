Savannah's The Grey was recognized by Esquire Magazine in their annual Best New Restaurants listing .\nA profile on The Grey's chef Mashama Bailey describes her as having a 'fresh perspective' on southern cuisine, as she was raised in New York and spent summers in the South. However, that doesn't mean she won't cook foods traditionally labelled as 'soul food'. Her collards are ' fragrant with pecan smoke, camp out over low-burning embers and arrive with a sidecar of serrano pickling vinegar.'\nThis is not the first national press the Savannah restaurant has garnered. Food & Wine Magazine named it as one of the best restaurants in 2015 . The New York Times raved about chef Bailey in August, calling her cooking ' a succulent collision of tradition and autobiography'.\nThe Grey joins other Georgia restaurants Gunshow and The Optimist as entries on the annual Esquire list.\nThe full list for 2015's best new restaurants is:\nShaya , New Orleans\nTownsman , Boston\nThe Progress , San Francisco\nMuscadine , Portland, OR\nThe Grey , Savannah\nJockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen , Morristown, N.J.\nB.S.
