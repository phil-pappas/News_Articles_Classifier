Jayaram, who is coached by Tom John at Bangalore, grabbed two match points first and then slammed the door on Must to clinch a deserving win. \nJayaram had won the Dutch Open, his maiden title last year. This is the second title of his career. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:02:42.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
