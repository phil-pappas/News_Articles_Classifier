Buy Now Adrian Sanchez-Gonzalez/Chronicle \nBozeman junior Connor Coles plays as a forward for the soccer team and handles kicking duties for football when available. \nThe sun was setting as Connor Coles jogged onto the Van Winkle Stadium turf. \nHe carried his helmet in his left hand, but wore his gray Hawks soccer shirt. Coles’ long red socks were bunched at his ankles at the top of his football cleats. He had just finished a two-hour soccer practice Thursday evening, and now prepared for a second workout. \nThis is the schedule Coles has embraced this fall as he lends his powerful right leg to the football team. He’s the third soccer player to do so since Ben Goertzen first pulled double duty in 2013, and the football team has benefited from the arrangement. \n“I’m really appreciative of (soccer head coach) Hunter Terry who's able to loan his guys over to us,” Hawks special teams coach Eric Fisher said. “They come over and do a great job kicking for us. They have a natural kicking stroke they’ve developed throughout the years, and they have a powerful leg.” \nColes joined football last season and was the backup to senior soccer player Riley McNeil. McNeil opted not to kick this year, so Coles has held down the position. \nThe overlapping schedule does force Coles to miss games, however. He’s a soccer player first, so he’s appeared in just four games on the gridiron. Wide receiver and safety Bennett Hostetler fills in when Coles is absent. \n“If you don’t enjoy both sports, then I don’t think you can have the energy to do it,” Coles said. “It’s kind of implied that soccer comes first. Soccer season ends earlier, and I can devote more time to football.” \nHis presence is felt when he is on the field. About half of his kickoffs go for touchbacks, Fisher said, and he’s missed just one of 19 point-after attempts. Coles also has hit one field goal. \n“It’s sure nice to kick it in the end zone,” Bozeman football coach Troy Purcell said. “It’s definitely an advantage. He hit a 47-yarder today in practice. … We believe in him and he has a great leg.” \nIt was on display immediately Thursday after Coles joined practice under the lights. He began to launch kicks through the uprights, sending teammates running over the track to the fence to retrieve balls. \n“His strength right now is his work ethic,” Fisher said. “He’s really interested and wants to get better. He sticks around late and gets some football kicks in and he has great leg speed, some great leg power, and that’s just the natural strike he’s developed.” \nHe’s just as valuable on the pitch, too. When standout forward McNeil was sidelined and other forwards battled injuries early, Coles stepped in and tallied a hat trick in one contest. \n“He knew that he needed to step up for the program and he made that happen,” Terry said. “He did a good job for us and worked hard and got a few goals that were important. \n“I can depend on Connor. He’s consistent, and I think the biggest thing is he bought into what this program does and what his role is.” \nWhile soccer (11-2) enjoys a bye before next week's state tournament, Coles will help football (7-1) aim for a fifth consecutive win tonight against visiting Great Falls CMR. \n“Soccer takes priority, but in the time that I’ve done this, it’s been fun to kick,” Coles said. “It’s a lot of adrenaline and it’s fun to kick off.” \n  Capsules \nGreat Falls CMR Rustlers (4-4) at Bozeman Hawks (7-1), 7 p.m., Van Winkle Stadium \n  his defensive plan won’t change despite Rustlers standout running back Andrew Grinde being out with a shoulder injury, according to the Great Falls Tribune. Class AA's rushing leader was hurt last week, and CMR will undoubtedly miss the Yale commit. \n“He is an outstanding running back and he was a guy we were going to key on,” Purcell said. “You never want to see a senior not be able to play. Hopefully he can recover and get back.” \nIn Grinde’s absence, Bozeman will be mindful of Montana State commit Carl Tucker. The wide receiver/running back has caught eight touchdowns and ran for three more. \nThe Hawks locked up a playoff spot last week, but is looking to secure     \nPark Rangers (1-7) at Belgrade Panthers (2-5), 7 p.m., Jason Green Field \nThe Panthers have bounced back from an 0-4 start and are now eyeing a No. 2 seed out of Central A. Belgrade head coach Eric Kinnaman said his team is in playoff mode for the last game of the season because a loss to the rebuilding Rangers means an end to the season. \n“It has been a battle,” Kinnaman said. “Throughout the entire season we’ve had injury issues and we got banged up in those first four games. … Right now, I’m very comfortable with where we’re sitting.” \nEspecially after a confidence-boosting win over Browning last week in which Kinnaman said his offense ran whatever it wanted with success. It was 27-0 in the second quarter thanks to a couple Indians turnovers, including one returned for a touchdown. \n“From that point on we had complete momentum to where we did whatever we wanted to do,” Kinnaman said. “It was actually a big win for us.” \nPark is looking for a bounce-back game offensively after putting up six last week against Corvallis. It was the sixth time this season the Rangers were held to seven or less. \nJefferson Panthers (7-1) at Manhattan Tigers (7-0), 7 p.m. \nThe Tigers meet possibly their toughest opponent this season in their regular-season finale. The Panthers have just one blemish on their schedule — a 42-2 loss to Fairfield. Take away that, and Panthers opponents have averaged just six points. \nThat defense will clash with Manhattan’s prolific offense, which averages 44.
