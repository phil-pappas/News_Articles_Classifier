I did not know where I was on the very hard final climb and there is a head wind which makes the final 200m difficult.\" \nFormer hour record Matthias Brandle had been favourite for the stage but he could only finish in a time of 11.35 and was amongst a whole bunch of riders finishing under twelve minutes. \nBrandle said: \"I made a good climb but without the wind things may have been different. We have a strong team here and on some of the next stages we can go on the attack.\" \nNo-one could get near Gougeard's time and he took the stage by three seconds from Martin Keizer.
