Down a handful of players, including singles starters Alexandra Rodriguez and Courtney Snyder, the Mounties saw shifts in almost every position. Emma Wallace moved up to first single, Amari Weddle took over for Wallace at second and Chloe Dunnell played third. Buy this photo \nWallace was Montclair's lone winner on Monday after a hard-fought match against Mia Bohi-Green that saw its fair share of long volleys and very well placed drop shots and lobs. Wallace would go on to win in two sets (7-6, 6-4) and improve her record on the year to a team-best 8-5. \nAlthough Weddle (6-3, 6-2) and Dunnell (6-3, 6-0) both lost in straight sets, they managed to keep games close with Weddle showing potential as she is only a sophomore. When a team is going to lose more than half of it's players, moments like this week's, although potentially detrimental to the season at hand, may prove to be a blessing in disguise. While Dunnell is one of the team's seniors, the more experience Weddle can get, the better both her and the team will be in the future. \n\"As the season goes on, we keep getting better,\" Weddle said. \"We're working on our strokes, defining them and getting them sharper. I think we've been playing well. We've also really meshed well as a team.\" \nDeMayo said that she's happy to see that the doubles players have started to mesh and gain that synergy that she's been hoping would develop. While the team of sophomores Lily Becker and Lily Feinberg, much like Weddle, are starting to grow and could turn into an anchor on the team, Dunnel and senior partner Kathryn Rizzo only have a few more games to enjoy each others company on the clay. \nThe Mounties took on Morristown in the quarterfinals of the NJSIAA North 1, Group IV tournament on Wednesday, Oct. 7 but played after the Times went to press. The Mounties only have a handful of games left in their season and, at 5-8, could very easily end the year above .500. \nCougars looks for late surge \nWith the win over Montclair, MKA improved to 4-6 and looks to end the season with a late burst of energy. The Cougars still have a ways to go before there season ends and hope that their young squad can rally late in the year. Although the team doesn't have the best record, head coach Bill Wing understands exactly where the team is at given only seniors captain Isabella Calandra and junior Joelle Crichlow are returning starters. Calandra, who played doubles last year and is third singles this year, has transitioned quite nicely at 6-4, especially after starting off the season 0-2 against tennis powerhouses Newark Academy and Millburn. \n\"We've got some growing pains,\" Wing said. \nThe Cougars have a good thing going for them this year as they will only be losing Calandra at the end of the year. Other than her, the team made up of freshmen Mia Bohi-Green and Michaela O'Hare and juniors Hallie Ryan, Katie Gyves, Joelle Crichlow, Miciah Lewis and Gianna Balonze will all be back next season. \nMKA faced off against Golda Och in the quarterfinals of the NJSIAA Non-Public B tournament on Wednesday, Oct. 7 but played after the Times went to press \nEmail: verhagen@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:16:27.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
