I believe he will be out until after the next international break. \n“With the (last) international break, the fact that he played against Andorra certainly cost (Gareth) Bale and him as well.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:28:54.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
