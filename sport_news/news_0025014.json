(Photo by Kaitlyn Egan/ESPN Images)\nA reporter for Forbes not only asks Jessica Mendoza about whether she gets “sick of answering questions about being a woman baseball broadcaster,” but also if a New York Times headline about her was misleading readers into thinking she’s too often criticized.\nA reporter for Cosmopolitan follows up with a query about an offensive tweet about Mendoza by an Atlanta sports talk host (who was eventually suspended) and why she went on ABC’s “Good Morning America” the next day and accepted his apology.\nA reporter for NPR’s “Morning Edition” just wants to know if she is “hurt” by anything written or said about her.\nEven as Mendoza sat in a backstage make-up chair prior to going on stage at the recent espnW Women+Sports conference in Dana Point, blinking as brushes and pencils get in her line of vision, she still was in a proper fielding position for more media-related questions.\nIn this case, all the ones we had.\nWhile the 34-year-old former Camarillo High softball All-American, Olympic gold medalist and Moorpark mom and wife has more “Baseball Tonight” studio work in Bristol, Conn., and a trip to the World Series on her work radar, we tried to find new things to ask her in the wake of her super-sized media profile that has translated into a #BroadcastLikeAGirl social media wave.\nWithout blushing, she obliged.\nQ: Stephen Colbert had a line about you in a recent “Late Night” monologue: “Last night, ESPN’s Jessica Mendoza became the first woman ever to announce a nationally televised playoff baseball game — proving once and for all that women are just as capable as men at staying awake for nine innings.” So congratulations on entering the pop-culture realm, and now how do you make sure you’re not just remembered as a trivia question on a board game 25 years from now?\nA: (Laughing) For me, it’s what you can control at the end of the day. I just want to be a good baseball analyst. As far as pop culture and all of that — I appreciate the support and attention, even when there’s negativity, but I haven’t thought about how to utilize this.\nQ: In the context of this women’s sports summit, there are all kinds of sessions involving leadership roles, excelling in sports and life, social change, using your power for a purpose. You come to this event annually. Is there any of these discussions that speak to you more than others especially in light of what’s happened to you this past month?\nA: I think what’s cool about the summit is that everything’s connected. I come out of this being around other phenomenal women and they have inspired me to keep going. It’s not so much the topics than the messaging and the overall realness. I’ve had conversations with women here where we’ve got very emotional, talking about how important this is. I saw Beth Mowins — she was the first person I worked with — and now she was doing play-by-play on Raiders preseason games. I get so much advice and help. It’s helped push me to get to this point where I’m at now.\nAdvertisement\nQ: Can you stay grounded when everyone, especially here, wants to treat you like a rock star?\nA: I’ve tried to just ... I’m thankful, but I don’t want it to affect or change me. I don’t want any other perception to skew my belief in where I still need to go. I don’t want to think I’ve gotten here just doing what I’ve been doing. I can’t let too much of this make me think I’ve done it. I still need to get to a game I’m doing two days early. I’m a nerd that way anyway. I want to watch batting practice and the opening of the clubhouse the day before the game because there’s more of a relaxed atmosphere. And that way I don’t feel pressure, I can hang out and do more observing and taking things in. Day of the game, it’s very rushed and “SportsCenter” hits and craziness.\nQ: What’s the best possible scenario for you at ESPN going forward on MLB coverage? Would you be fine going back to a regular Monday night booth with Dave O’Brien as you were before this whole ‘Sunday Night’ national package?\nA: I want to be in the booth any day — Sunday, Monday, Wednesday — it doesn’t matter to me. I’m hooked. I love it. Just being on the field, talking to the guys, getting near the cage. I want to get to know more players, more managers. I really want to learn more. I hope I can continue to be in the booth in some capacity.\nQ: Is there any validity to people’s critique that they just aren’t used to hearing a “female voice” in the context of a broadcast that has been male-dominated since it first began? Is it an audio adjustment?\nA: It is different. A female voice can automatically trigger a reaction. The reasons why? Sound is the initial thing, and I’ve had people tell me that. “I’m watching the game and all of a sudden I stopped because I heard a female voice. Wait a second.” You know? From there, that’s when people really hone in and I’m aware of the fact that I can’t be saying things that I can’t back up. There are now 10 million more times careful listeners.\nQ: Careful is one. Critical ones are another. You seem to be able to handle criticism as long as it’s constructive?\nA: That’s the only kind of criticism I want to listen to. If it’s just the fact that I’m female ... (smiling) I’ve been aware of that fact for quite some time.\nQ: The name Suzyn Waldman, the former New York Yankees radio play-by-play voice, has come back into the discussion because of what you’ve done. When you were back in New York recently to call the AL wild-card game, did you get to meet and talk to her?\nA: We took a picture together when I was back there. She’s phenomenal. I was listening to a Yankees game on the radio a couple of years ago, I was in the car, and I almost forgot I was driving when I heard her voice. “Was that a female voice?” And a very distinct one. I turned it up and it was the pregame and she was giving some analysis and I was like, “OK ... female ... doing a great job ... well respected ...” The fact I got to meet her, I think it was meant to happen for me to be at Yankee Stadium on that night for that game. Because of her and what she’s done. The advice she gave me ... one thing she told me was when you’re talking to players and coaches, a lot of times you want to get right into your questions. But Google them, find things you can talk about outside of baseball, connect on a different level first. Maybe the first time you talk to them, it’s OK if you don’t even ask a baseball question. That was huge. I totally want to ask a question about baseball, but that makes sense. They’re inundated every day with baseball questions. That works for any reporter, really. It’s already hard enough for me to navigate a clubhouse. In a perfect world, if I can get conversations done at a batting cage, there’s exactly the place I want to be.\nQ: Again, in the context of what you’re doing on televised MLB coverage, do you think you’re really anything different than how Fox uses Tom Verducci as a booth analyst? He’s never played major league baseball, but there he is talking about it. Why is what you’re doing so much different from him in that regard?\nA: If you know, you know. It’s plain and simple. There are a lot of people who know and those doors are opening more and more.\nQ: How has the family been taking all this in? Do your two kids look at you differently?\nA: My older son, when things were at the peak of attention, comes up to me and says: “Mom, I know people are saying you’re doing stuff that’s cool. But I listened, and all you did was talk. It was pretty boring.” Thanks for that. “Well, you could have like danced or done something else. Like do some ninja moves.” Yes, that’s what I could have done. That’s where I’m at right now. Mom’s boring.\nMEASURING MEDIA MOMENTUM\nWHAT SMOKES\n• It might have taken Jason Whitlock more than 2,400 words to explain why he’s no longer running the L.A-based TheUndefeated.com website at ESPN and subsequently has taken work back at Fox Sports, but at least we finally hear what we suspected all along when we visited this about five months ago : He admits the downfall was “my foolish belief I could manage like a football coach. I learned there’s an art to corporate politics that I’m not good at.” He also cited ESPN cost cutting. He closed his essay: “Stick with me. Indulge me. Arriving at the truth is a winding journey. There have been hundreds of thousands of words written about me the last two years. I’m going to unravel them, show you how lies and distortions get repeated and accepted as truth. It’s going to take some time.” Fox says Whitlock’s columns will appear daily at J.school, and a podcast is expected to launch soon. He will have an FS1 show sometime in early 2016. Yet, if asked to frame the fact that both Whitlock and Bill Simmons are no longer at ESPN, we’ll defer to this piece by Michael McCarthy for The Sporting News that begins: “Ex-ESPNers Bill Simmons and Jason Whitlock like to portray themselves as rebels challenging the corruption and corporate cronyism of sports. In fact, they’re pretty similar: They’re fake insurgents more interested in promoting their brands than speaking truth to power, and they’re thin-skinned narcissists who somehow feel persecuted despite being paid top dollar by the biggest sports media giants.”\nWHAT CHOKES\n• The L.A. market might have had a respectable 11.0 Nielsen rating for Thursday night’s TBS telecast of the Dodgers-Mets NLDS Game 5 from Dodger Stadium, according to industry numbers. But it still trailed by a large margin to the 18.4 rating that came from the New York market. In L.A., the five NLDS games averaged 7.8 by Nielsen’s figures. N.Y. averaged 12.7. The decisive Dodgers-Mets game that had a national overnight rating of 4.5 also overlapped with the NFL’s non-important Atlanta-New Orleans game on CBS, which had more than double the baseball audience at 10.4 overnight rating. It was also on the NFL Network. In L.A., that NFL game did a 6.3 rating/12 share overnight on KCBS-Channel 2 — surprisingly not that distant from the Dodgers-Mets cable coverage. CBS also won the night in prime-time viewing.\nMore sports-media notes at www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth\n thomas.hoffarth@dailynews.com or follow Tom on Twitter: @tomhoffarth Tom Hoffarth Back to top", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=33", "http://www.npr.org/2015/10/15/448840656/espn-s-jessica-mendoza-on-being-the-first-woman-to-call-a-mlb-playoff-game", "http://espnwsummit.com/", "http://theundefeated.com/", "http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/career/interviews/a47579/jessica-mendoza-female-analyst-mlb/", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexreimer/2015/10/14/jessica-mendoza-espn-interview/", "http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/2015/10/16/the-dodgers-mets-tv-aftermath-n-y-viewers-more-engaged/", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/raissman-shining-light-pioneers-suzyn-waldman-article-1.2392743", "http://twitter.com/tomhoffarth", "http://j.school/post/131134873540/the-explanation-20-still-undefeated", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151016/SPORTS/151019469/EP/1/1/EP-151019469.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667", "http://www.sportingnews.com/sport/story/2015-10-15/jason-whitlock-bill-simmons-espn-fox-hbo-puppets-corporate-america-undefeated-grantland-deadspin"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:38:22.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
