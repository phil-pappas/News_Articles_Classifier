It's putting artists to work, quite frankly, and their work will be displayed in public areas and our clubs and suites.\" \nThe collection's pieces were created by 34 Minnesota artists, from nationally known talent to recent art school graduates. They even include ceramic art by former Vikings star Carl Eller. \n\"I'm really excited about it and was very happy to be selected,\" said Eller, a Hall of Fame defensive end who turned to ceramics as a hobby and shows his creations at art fairs, according to the Star Tribune ( http://strib.mn/1GuuOvX ). \nThe artists were picked from more than 1,100 applicants by Sports & The Arts, a California-based company specializing in stadium projects. All projects will be new designs specific to the stadium. \n\"We were overwhelmed by the number of submissions, and they're very good artists, so I think the Vikings' stadium will top everything we've done before,\" said Camille Speca, a SATA partner. The company's previous clients include Yankee Stadium in New York City, the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium and the Marlins' ballpark in Miami. \nInformation from: Star Tribune, http://www.startribune.com \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:37:21.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
