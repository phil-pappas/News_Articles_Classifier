No respect, no respect. \n\"And I'm not speaking about football. Football I'm ready to accept any kind of criticism, even the stupid ones. \n\"Private life and stupid things that you bring to light, I don't like it. So we go to a different level of professional relationship.\" \nThe footage shows Mourinho being unhappy with the approach of the teenagers. \nA Chelsea spokesperson said: \"We've noted the two recent stories concerning Jose being filmed on mobile phones. \n\"While Jose understands the laws pertaining to filming in public places, the two teenagers in question followed him from his home for 20 minutes and constantly interrupted a private phone call, which he and the club believes goes beyond the grounds of reasonable behaviour. \n\"Jose has always spoken warmly of the public reception he receives in London, but both Jose and the club consider these last two instances as overly intrusive. \n\"We also note the allegation of intimidation in those stories, which Jose strongly refutes and which his legal representatives will continue to monitor closely.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:12:08.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
