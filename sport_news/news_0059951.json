Label-obsessed dandies pair the kicks with distressed jeans and button-down shirts or quilted sweatshirts for nights out at the club. Collectors leave their precious patent-leather Medusa high-tops in plastic, kept pristine in boxes.\nWhere's it come from? In Greek mythology, Medusa is a she-monster with snakes for hair, so one look at the old girl will turn you into stone. The Greek hero Perseus killed Medusa, and with her head, turned enemies into stone (talk about weaponry). In 1978, Gianni Versace started his fashion house in Milan and chose the head of Medusa as his logo to symbolize strength, power, and femininity. The Medusa head was a graphic print in silk shirts, and he interspersed the logo on cuff links, buckles, and sunglasses. At his Miami home, you would see Medusa heads everywhere, starting with the gates to his compound. Even after Versace's death in 1997, the Medusa head was key to the brand's look.\nFast-forward to around 2008, when Giuseppe Zanotti put out men's high-top sneakers featuring hardware like zippers and buckles. Designer brands Balenciaga and Gucci followed suit, and Versace eventually caught on, too - with a hefty price tag. Depending upon the size of the Medusa head, the sneakers can run between $800 and $1,500 a pair (seriously).\nIn 2013, rapper Migos released his hit song \"Versace,\" and the first line paid homage to the Medusa head: \"Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati.\"\nA trend - albeit a scary one - was born.\nWho's wearing them? Rappers on fleek like 2Chainz, Rick Ross, and Lil Scrappy from VH1's Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta . Chris Brown and Usher have an affinity for the Medusa-head chains. And we wouldn't be surprised if Hakeem Lyon (played by Philadelphia's own Bryshere Gray) turned up in a pair on Fox's hit show Empire . Or maybe even Ricky Jarrett on the HBO show Ballers , played by John David Washington (yes, that's Denzel's son).\nWould Elizabeth wear them? Uh . . . no. The most expensive sneaks I have are my running shoes, and I try to keep them under $150.\nShould you wear them? Only if you don't mind shelling out more than a rent or mortgage payment for a pair of tennis shoes.\newellington@phillynews.com 215-854-2704@ewellingtonphl\nVersace Medusa head high-tops in red, $1,175; Versace Medusa head high-tops in gray, $1,295.
