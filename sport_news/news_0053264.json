''This is my first one. I've always been really close, but never got it.'' \nElena Delle Donne of the Chicago Sky had 21 points in her first game for the national team. \n''We've got a great group,'' said coach Geno Auriemma of the University of Connecticut. ''They love playing together. They're very, very competitive. They pick things up quickly. They shared the ball and you saw Candace Parker with 12 assists. You've got some of the best scorers in the WNBA and they're looking to make plays for other people. I think that kind of attitude is why we are who we are.'' \nSince being selected to coach the team in 2009, Auriemma has directed the squad to a 23-0 record and gold medals at the 2010 and 2014 FIBA World Championships and 2012 Olympic Games. \nThe Americans will face Italy in Rome on Wednesday night, Dike Naples on Thursday night in Italy, and finish the tour Friday night at EuroLeague champion USK Prague. \nUni Girona won the Spanish League title last season. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:20:24.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
