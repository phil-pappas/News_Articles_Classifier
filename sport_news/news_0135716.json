Derek Rosen / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. The entrance to Linden High School’s football field had two large displays Friday night. The one to the left displayed the Emerald City from “The Wizard of Oz,” the other had a pair of red shoes and simply said, “There is no place like home.” It was homecoming for Linden, and the entire community was feeling the buzz. The band entered the field early and provided an eclectic choice of workout music including, a rendition of Katy Perry’s “Fireworks” and Smashmouth’s “All Star.” Bret Harte entered the game facing not only an opposing team, but also a community gearing up for an exciting night. On a night full of excitement for the hometown crowd, it was the visiting team who triumphed 21-13. Though, the game could not have started any better for Linden. The opening kickoff by the Lions went sailing beyond the Bret Harte returners for a touchback. The Bullfrogs’ first drive lasted three plays. It was the Bullfrog defense that made the first impactful play when they forced a fumble on a run during Linden’s first possession. This set up Bret Harte with great field position. On second down, the Bullfrogs fumbled a ball on a run, but they luckily recovered it. The following play there was a mix up on a pass call. Bret Harte was unable to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity. Linden and Bret Harte exchanged punts on the next two drives, and the Bullfrogs seemed to be in a better position to make something happen offensively. They outperformed the Lions offensively with six first downs compared to Linden’s two. It was Linden’s second play on the following drive where running back Hunter White broke through two arm tackles near the line of scrimmage and ran for a 49-yard touchdown. With 3:40 left in the first quarter, Linden was in the lead 7-0. This would not be the only time Hunter White scored in the half. In the first drive of the second quarter, the Lions ripped off another big run this one being 25 yards. After a failed point after touchdown attempt, the Lions lead 13-0. Although the first half would end without a change in the score, Bret Harte threatened to score on several drives due to a consistent run game and some strong completions by junior quarterback James Brechtel. There were two opportunities for the Bullfrogs at the end of the first half where Brechtel had open receivers, however they were unable to complete the passes. Going into halftime, Bret Harte was down 13-0, but they had received solid performances from quarterback Michael Ziehlke and running back Anthony Howard who kept the Bullfrog offense on schedule. If not for two runs by Linden’s Hunter White who tallied 105 yards on 9 rushes, with 74 of those yards coming on his touchdown runs, the Bullfrogs kept the Lions in check. Coming out in the second half it was apparent the Bullfrogs were fired up. They came out with consecutive defensive stands, but their offense was still not producing. It was the continued use of basic plays and smart football that turned the tide. The fourth quarter opened up the floodgates for Bret Harte and the first points were scored on a 10-yard pass reception thrown by Brechtel. The Bullfrog defense was stifling late in the game and was highlighted by a drive-ending sack from Nick Osborn. Austin High continued to put the pressure on Linden by intercepting a pass. It was the leader of the team, the quarterback Ziehlke that put the Bullfrogs ahead with 4:32 left. Directly after Bret Harte went up by 1 at a 14-13 score, coach Casey Kester made the decision to call a pooch kick. The Bullfrogs recovered and made sure to exploit their gutsy decision. The quarterback made one last heroic play to give Bret Harte the cushion they needed. This time however, the touchdown came on a 34-yard run. Ziehlke may have been the player to score the touchdowns, but if it was not for the hard nose running by Austin Howard, Javon Gilbert, Joey Kraft, and Dawson Terry, there never would have been the opportunity for those runs. In the end, the game was sealed by an interception from Brady Westberg. When asked about the play Westberg said, “The quarterback was really easy to read you can see his eyes really well and I was lucky enough the receiver tipped it up...I was playing linebacker so I just take up any space I can and make a play.” The difference between the performance in the second half by the Bullfrogs compared to the first half was dramatic. The first half was highlighted by four 15-yard penalties, tons of mental errors, and missed tackles. This did not go unnoticed by Kester. “The problem we had in the first half was all mental. I asked the players ‘is the other team throwing you out of the way?’ No they aren’t, what was hurting us was mental errors,” he said. Bret Harte did not deviate from the plan, they stuck to their plan from practice and made sure to execute it later in the game. The question came up to Kester about adjustments he told his team to make. “I told them to be ice. Take that emotion inside, use it, but be as cold as ice. That is how you win football games like this.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:04:01.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
