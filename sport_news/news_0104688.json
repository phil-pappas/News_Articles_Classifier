They remain on a tightrope, wobbly slightly There is no wiggle room. They fall and they’re finished. They tripped a little in Game 3 before turning it one-sided. By late this afternoon, this series is heading to Game 5 or it’s over. \nChris Colabello talked about this Blue Jays team before the game, about how close this team is, about how tight everybody is and how much they believe in each other. He called this the greatest experience of his baseball life. That was before Troy Tulowitzki’s stunning sixth inning home run meant there would be a Game 4. \n“We have to win three games,” said Colabello. “But you can’t do that in one night. You have to win the first one. Then worry about the second one. And go from there.” \nFor Estrada, this is a finality of sorts that is strictly personal. He is a free agent at the end of this unlikely season. He hasn’t exactly, by baseball’s standards, cashed in on his up and down career. David Price made more money in half a season that Estrada has made in his entire career. \nBut this has been his season in the sun: Early on, in June, he won a game in Washington against Max Scherzer that may have prevented a firing or two or discussion about it. That seems so long ago now. He won then, continued to win, was sharp as he can be on a hot Sunday night. \nHe did what he had to do. What the Blue Jays, who want to keep him, needed. He has said on occasion that he would like to stay in Toronto. But the price is going up and free agency tends to take on a life of its own. It will cost in the range of three seasons and $27 million to retain Estrada. \nIn David Price’s 11 starts with the Blue Jays, the Jays won nine of those games, his earned run average was 2.31. In the 13 starts Estrada made from the time Price came to Toronto, the Jays were 9-4 and Estrada had a 2.52 earned run average. In the one playoff starts, Estrada outshone Price, who was warming in the bullpen late Sunday. \nPrice will command some $200 million in free agency, and demand for him will be rich. Estrada is two years older. Demand for him will be growing. By how much it’s impossible to know. \nWhile trying to balance what this series is with thinking about what this team will next season, the Jays realize some will certainly be gone. Estrada’s future is up in the air, Mark Buehrle won’t be here and who knows what the next evolution of Drew Hutchison will bring. That leaves Marcus Stroman and R.A. Dickey and who knows what else. \nIt makes Estrada more valuable to the Jays than maybe anything else. And they sure owe him a little something for keeping this series alive, throwing 61/3 innings and just one run allowed. He didn’t give up a run or have any difficulty until the seventh inning. \n“He’s the total package,” Dickey said of Estrada. “I said it in spring training, in order to win a championship, any championship, a division, an AL championship, a world championship, you’re going to have to have guys step up ... I mean he was as close to a cut in spring training and here he is probably one of our top two starters. \n“Marco has proven to be an incredible asset for us.” \nHe played the part of saviour in June at a time when the Blue Jays had lost seven games more than they had won. He stopped the bleeding then, did it again when it was mandatory Sunday night. There was no margin for error and on a night when that was necessary, Marco Estrada provided none.
