The veterans get their chance to prove the same about themselves right away. \nIn the team’s first practice since being trimmed down to 24, Babcock addressed one order of business that has always been a hot-button topic around the MasterCard and Air Canada Centres in previous seasons: Jonathan Bernier will indeed be the team’s starting goalie to open the 2015-16 season. \nThe two-year, $8.3-million contract Bernier signed in the summer made it his job to lose and there wasn’t much difference between him and James Reimer in the pre-season. \n“I’ve known this for a long time, that he’s starting,” Babcock said Monday. “(Bernier’s) a good skater, he’s smart, he’s worked on his game. I think he’s shown in the league that he can be a good goaltender. His game wasn’t the way it should have been last year ... we expect him to have a much better year.” \nIt’s a familiar second-fiddle role for Reimer, not that he seems bothered by it, even though Babcock has repeatedly been on record saying he wants a clear No. 1. \n“He’s shown himself to be dependable over the last couple of years, so that’s the decision,” Reimer said of Bernier. “When I get the chance, I’ll be ready.” \nWith a busy three-games-in-four-nights start to the season, Reimer won’t have to wait long for the opportunity. After facing the Habs on Wednesday, Bernier will also get the call Friday night in Detroit, with Reimer in Saturday back at home against the Ottawa Senators. \nThe other development Monday at the team’s Etobicoke practice facility may have an effect on the final cut the team needs to make by 5 p.m. Tuesday to get to the 23-man regular-season roster. Stephane Robidas, who struggled at times in camp, didn’t practice. \n“His knee has been sore all camp, it’s affecting his groin now,” Babcock said of the defenceman, who played 18 minutes and 30 seconds in a pre-season game against the Red Wings on Friday. \nIf the Leafs are able to put Robidas on injured reserve, it will allow management to keep all seven remaining defencemen when the season opens, with 22-year-old Scott Harrington the likely beneficiary. \nAs for the hectic start to the season, after a long training camp and his natural curiosity to see what he has at his disposal, Babcock says, “Bring it on.” \n“I’m just glad we’re playing,” he said. “I’m glad exhibition is over. We’ll have two practice days and we’ll be excited to play. It’s more of a measure of what you have. \n“I’m excited, just like the players. Let’s get going.” \nSHANNY GIVES SOME POINTERS \nThink Leafs president Brendan Shanahan is ready for the NHL season to begin? It sure looked like it Monday afternoon at the MasterCard Centre when the hall of famer – dressed in a sport coat and dress shoes - hopped onto the ice to give some pointers to forward Brad Boyes, defenceman Scott Harrington and goaltender James Reimer. \n“He kind of came out of nowhere,” said Boyes, who was a teammate with Shanahan on the Canadian entry at the 2006 world championship. “He said he was watching from somewhere and it caught his eye and he had some advice on some things. \n“It was good. Some power-play stuff we were talking about and some insight.” \nWhile Shanahan isn’t bucking for a spot behind the bench alongside his former coach, Mike Babcock, apparently he’s not shy about talking with the players on the payroll. \n“You go back to being a fan,” Reimer said of the session that came at the conclusion of the Leafs 60-minute practice on Monday. “You grew up watching him do his thing and it was cool to hear him talk about his craft.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:00:39.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
