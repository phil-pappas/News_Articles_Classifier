Once more Murray broke Johnson at the crucial time, taking the match in 1 hour and 16 minutes. \nAfter the match Murray told Sky Sports: \"I thought I played well. I struck the ball very clean off both sides, returned well and the serve was good. \n\"I got a lot of free points on the first serve and I was hitting my spots there when it landed. \n\"I could have made things a bit easier in the second set, but I played well, I moved well, it was a good start for me.\" \nMurray will play John Isner in the next round. \nThe big-serving American beat David Goffin in straight sets in Wednesday's second, but the American has a poor record against Murray having lost all four of their previous encounters.
