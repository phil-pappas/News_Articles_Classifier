Countering Owaisi, who has expanded his electoral footprint beyond Hyderabad to Maharashtra within three years, is a significant part of Congress’ poll strategy in the state with party vice-president Rahul Gandhi all set to take up the challenge. Apart from the fact that Rahul will rally in select constituencies of Seemanchal, from where Owaisi has announced plans to field candidates in the forthcoming elections, the party is planning to drive home the message that Owaisi is working to benefit the BJP. This is exactly what the Congress successfully did in the recent Bengaluru civic body polls where Owaisi had fielded candidates in all 27 wards. A Congress leader today said: “In Bengaluru civil polls, the message had gone through that Owaisi was around to aid the cause of saffron forces. The results for the Congress were positive.” An analysis of MIM’s performance in the Bengaluru civic polls shows the maximum votes his candidates got in any ward was a meager 1,703 (Sudhama Nagar). In the rest, the performance of Owaisi’s candidates remained abysmal as they got votes as low as 21 (Jakkur ward). The range of votes MIM candidates garnered in 27 Bengaluru was between 200 and 1,500. The Congress won 16 of these 27 wards with the BJP winning just seven and the rest going to Independents. This was in contrast to Owaisi’s performance in the Maharashtra Assembly poll in 2014 where his party won two out of the 25 segments it contested. The MIM heavily dented the Muslim vote bank of the Congress and NCP in the state polls. In 2012, when the MIM entered Maharashtra politics, it won 11 out of 81 seats it contested in the Nanded MC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:15:49.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
