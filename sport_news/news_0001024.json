For everyone else, it will cost $19.99. At the moment, you can purchase the game digitally, but the team plans to release it to retailers later this month, possibly into early November. Check out some of the details below, taken from their Q&A . What is the difference between NASCAR 15 and NASCAR 15 Victory Edition? NASCAR 15 Victory Edition includes the original NASCAR 15 game, all game patches and updates, 36 previously released DLC paint schemes, the addition of driver Bubba Wallace in the Cheez-It car, and, for the first time ever, Brad Keselowski's MillerCoors schemes (available to players ages 21+). Will current NASCAR 15 owners get the Victory Edition update? Yes. If you currently own NASCAR 15, you will automatically receive the Victory Edition update for free. If I own NASCAR 15, should I buy Victory Edition? Current owners of NASCAR 15 will automatically receive the Victory Edition update for free. Unless youre a Joey Logano fan and want the new game cover, we recommend passing on Victory Edition if you already own NASCAR 15. What is the NASCAR 16 update? Who gets the update and when will it be released? The NASCAR 16 update will be available to all owners of NASCAR 15 Victory Edition (including those who updated from NASCAR 15). It will be released in early 2016 and include the 2016 NASCAR schedule and more. Details will be released at a later date. # 1 Turbojugend @ 10/14/15 04:22 PM Nice, I'll check this out when I get home tonight. Paint schemes aside, any word on what the \"few surprises\" are in this edition? # 2 BurghFan @ 10/14/15 09:58 PM Quote: Nice, I'll check this out when I get home tonight. Paint schemes aside, any word on what the \"few surprises\" are in this edition? 1 new driver, Bubba Wallace Jr. in the RFR #6 Cheez-it Ford. # 3 Turbojugend @ 10/15/15 08:52 AM Quote: 1 new driver, Bubba Wallace Jr. in the RFR #6 Cheez-it Ford. lol. Oh well, can't complain about free I guess. # 4 brandon27 @ 10/16/15 02:14 PM Was this actually worth buying? And by worth it... I mean is it worth it to blow the dust off my 360 to fire it up and then actually buy this after their first few failed attempts? Being serious here... I never picked this up because I moved to the XB1, and did it ever actually end up being an improvement over their last effort? # 5 Motown @ 10/16/15 02:33 PM My cuz seems to think the AI has been tweaked...they race you like they're sober now. # 6 Turbojugend @ 10/16/15 03:36 PM Quote: Originally Posted by brandon27 Was this actually worth buying?

There's nothing here that will change your mind if you didn't enjoy the previous ETX NASCAR games, especially since 15 is basically a re-skin of 14. The A.I. is (apparently) improved, some bugs have been fixed and there are a bunch of new paint schemes. That's about it. I picked up 15 on a PSN sale for $13.99 and the Victory Edition upgrade is free, I do enjoy these games so I feel like I got my money's worth. $19.99 would be a stretch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:47:15.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
