Lost to Chicago Blackhawks in Western Conference finals. \nCOACH: Bruce Boudreau (fifth season, eighth NHL season). \nADDED: D Kevin Bieksa, F Carl Hagelin, F Chris Stewart, F Shawn Horcoff, F Mike Santorelli, G Anton Khudobin. \nLOST: F Matt Beleskey, D Francois Beauchemin, F Emerson Etem, F Kyle Palmieri, D James Wisniewski. \nPLAYER TO WATCH: D Hampus Lindholm. In his third season with the Ducks, the 21-year-old Swede could be ready to become one of the NHL's elite defensemen. After contributing 10 points and major minutes during last season's playoff run, the smart, tireless puck-mover will have major responsibilities this winter in Beauchemin's absence. \nOUTLOOK: The Ducks are a popular preseason pick to win their first title since 2007. Anaheim has an enviable mix of veteran stars in their prime and up-and-coming talent, and they've improved by one playoff round in each of the past three seasons. With no real question areas and an added urgency after last season's painful Game 7 loss to Chicago at home, the door to a championship is wide open for Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry and Ryan Kesler. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:10:25.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
