Tyler Davis kicked a 30-yard field goal to cap the scoring. \nZander Diamont scored on a 12-yard run for the Hoosiers (4-2, 1-2 Big Ten) but completed just 9 of 17 passes for 90 yards before he was injured in the third quarter. \nSenior defensive end Carl Nassib forced two fumbles and finished with two sacks for the Nittany Lions (5-1, 2-0). \nWISCONSIN 23, NEBRASKA 21 (at Lincoln, Neb.) — Rafael Gaglianone made a 46-yard field goal with four seconds left after missing from 39 yards about a minute earlier to lift the Badgers. \nFullback Andy Janovich broke a 55-yard touchdown run with 3:38 left to give Nebraska the lead, but the Cornhuskers (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) for the second straight week couldn't put away their opponent. \nDare Ogunbowale rushed for 117 yards for Wisconsin. \nMINNESOTA 41, PURDUE 13 (at West Lafayette, Ind.) — Shannon Brooks rushed for 176 yards and changed the game with a 71-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter to help the Gophers break out of their offensive funk. \nMinnesota (4-2, 1-1 Big Ten) had 28 points in the quarter — more than it scored in any of its previous five games.
