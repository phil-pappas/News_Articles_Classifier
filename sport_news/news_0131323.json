The medical examiners have now ruled Harper-Mercer's death a suicide. Whether it was his bullet or an officer's, deputies won't say.\n\"It's one of those incidents that you hope you never have to come across,\" said Fire Chief Greg Marlar with Douglas Co. Fire Department #2.\nChief Greg Marlar was one of the first on scene. He said he didn't know until he walked into the classroom how many had been killed, or that two of those victims had ties to his department.\n\"It's personal. We have, within our family, people who have been affected by this,\" said Marlar.\n18-year-old Rebecka Carnes was the niece of a local paramedic. 20-year-old Treven Anspach was the son of a local firefighter , who was off duty at the time.\n\"I, personally, I went up and met with Justin and his wife Kim Thursday night to confirm the news,\" said Marlar.\nDeputies said it's for Anspach's family and those of the eight other victims , that they're working so diligently to find answers.\n\"To the families of the victims, our hearts are with you and you know that our hearts will be with you forever. Please know that we consider your loved ones to be our heroes. They will never be forgotten,\" said Sheriff John Hanlin.\nOregon State Police are still investigating the shootout with the suspect. \nOnce their investigation is over, the Douglas County District Attorney said it's up to him to decide if that use of force was justified. \nIn the meantime, FBI behavioral analysts are on scene to try and figure out why the shooting happened.\nCopyright 2015 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.
