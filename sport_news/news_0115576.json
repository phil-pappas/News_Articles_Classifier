(Getty Images) By Michael Bradley \nThe atmosphere throughout Kansas City was raucous back in 1985. Delirious Royals fans and players alike toasted the city's first-ever MLB championship, an improbable seven-game triumph over their intrastate rivals from St. Louis, which had begun with the Royals losing their first two games at home. \nGame 7 marked Bret Saberhagen's second Series win. In 18 Fall Classic innings, he allowed just one run and 11 hits. If anybody had a right to tear the town apart, it was Saberhagen. Instead, he headed to the hospital to commemorate an even more personal milestone. \n\"It was the best time of my life, that's for sure,\" the Series MVP said. \"We win the Series, and my first child is born. You couldn't write a better script.\" \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nSaberhagen may be right, but baseball's top contenders sure tried to write a fitting follow-up the next two seasons. The '86 battle between the Red Sox and Mets featured the infamous Bill Buckner error that swung the momentum in Game 6, while in '87, Minnesota triumphed over the Cards in the first Series in which all seven games were won by the home team. \n\"That was such an electric time,\" says Danny Cox, who pitched for the Cardinals in the 1985 and '87 Series. \"No matter where we were, things were really cranking. The noise wasn't being pumped in over speakers. All the energy was created by the fans.\" \nIn '85, Cox was in just his second full season with the Cards, and had won 18 games. Throughout his 11-year career, the '85 team remained his favorite. \n\"That was probably my most exciting time in the Majors,\" he says. \"We were energized to play Kansas City.\" \nThe Cardinals had taken the two games of the Series, which included an impressive comeback victory in Game 2. But then came Saberhagen, who threw a Game 3 six-hitter in front of a raucous Busch Stadium crowd to quell the Cardinals' momentum. \n\"I felt good,\" he says. \"I was confident. They hadn't seen me before. You can go over tapes, but until you see him, the situation favors the pitcher.\" \nIn Game 4, John Tudor threw a tidy five-hit shutout that gave the Cards a commanding 3-games-to-1 Series lead. Kansas City had similarly been behind against Toronto in the ALCS, though, so the Royals weren't panicking. \"Our mentality was, the pressure was on them, because they had to win,\" Saberhagen says. \"Nobody expected us to do anything then.\" \nDanny Jackson, a 23-year-old lefty, got the call for Kansas City in Game 5 and responded with a complete-game five-hitter in a 6-1 win, highlighted by Willie Wilson's two-run triple. Game 6 was scoreless until the Cardinals took a 1-0 lead in the top of the eighth, but the Royals didn't back down. Pinch-hitter Jorge Orta led off the ninth with a grounder between first and second, and the toss to Todd Worrell at first appeared to be in time. But umpire Don Denkinger called Orta safe, infuriating the Cardinals. Four batters later, with the bases loaded, Dane Iorg knocked a two-RBI single to tie the Series. \nIn the seventh game, the Royals scored two runs in the second and three in the third to chase Tudor early. Meanwhile, Saberhagen was outstanding, scattering five hits without allowing a run. The comeback was complete, and the proud father could celebrate with his family. \n\"By far, Game 7 was the most nervous I have ever been,\" Saberhagen says. \"Before the game, I was filled with adrenaline and butterflies. If we won, we would be champions. If we lost, we would finish second, and the season would be a disappointment. \n\"Having the distraction of welcoming a baby and spending time at the hospital [the day before] Game 7 helped me.\" \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nEven Game 6 of the '85 Series couldn't compare to the historic moment that unfolded in the sixth game between the Mets and Red Sox a year later. By now, just about every fan knows the story of the Mookie Wilson grounder that snuck under the glove and between the legs of Boston first baseman Buckner, allowing Ray Knight to score the winning run and tie the Series. But what few remember is that Wilson had fouled off four two-strike offerings from Bob Stanley with the Red Sox holding a 5-4 lead, and that a wild pitch during Wilson's at-bat plated Kevin Mitchell to knot the score. Then came Buckner's error. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nAlthough Game 7 was postponed a day by rain, the Red Sox still couldn't shake the disappointment. Boston took a 3-0 lead in the second, but the Mets piled on eight runs to clinch their first title since 1969. \n\"In Game 6, we took Boston's heart,\" Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden told Newsday earlier this year. \"I don't think they were comfortable with a 3-0 lead [in Game 7]. But Boston was done because of what we did in Game 6.\" \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nA year later, the upstart Minnesota Twins pulled off their own comeback, staving off elimination before securing a win over St. Louis in the finale. The Cardinals had won 95 games that year and held a 3-2 Series advantage going into Game 6. But the Fall Classic was heading back to Minneapolis's raucous Metrodome, where the Twins had won the first two games. The indoor venue with the trash bag outfield fences was also a den of noise pollution. \"It was overbearing,\" Cox says. \"Afterward, it was like leaving a rock concert. My ears were ringing.\" \nAfter taking an early lead, Minnesota would blow the game open in the sixth when local boy Kent Hrbek hit a grand slam on the first pitch his saw from Ken Dayley. St. Louis took a lead in the second inning of Game 7, but Minnesota snuck back with runs in the second and fifth. In the sixth, Greg Gagne's bases-loaded infield hit gave the Twins a 3-2 edge, and Dan Gladden's eighth-inning RBI double provided some insurance. Frank Viola notched his second win of the Series with eight innings of work, and Jeff Reardon shut the door in the ninth to give the Twins their first-ever World Series title. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThe team that ABC's Al Michaels said was \"out-everythinged\" against the mighty Cardinals had not only ridden its \"Dome-field\" advantage to the Series title, but concluded a three-year stretch of baseball history like none before it. \n* * * \nMichael Bradley is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia.
