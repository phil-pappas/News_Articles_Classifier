It must be what tightrope walkers feel when they reach the other skyscraper, or a stuntman feels when the motorcycle lands on the far side of the canyon, and doesn’t skid out. The Toronto Blue Jays aren’t safe yet; they’re still on the rope, or in the air. But they’re alive, and get to keep going.\n“We’ve allowed ourselves the chance to play another game,” said Jose Bautista, who took the biggest pitch of Toronto’s 7-1 win in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals, and walked away.\nThe Jays now trail 3-2 in the best-of-seven series, and it looks like it was easy if you only look at the final score. It wasn’t, though. It was survival. Disaster has to wait.\nIt could have gone so wrong, so easily. Marco Estrada was glittering on the mound, a master, and he didn’t allow a Kansas City baserunner past second base through six innings. Chris Colabello, this team’s closest thing to a baseball vagabond, had homered in the second for a 1-0 lead. But 1-0 against Kansas City is nothing. A 1-0 lead against the Royals is trying to walk the wire with your eyes closed.\nAnd in the bottom of the sixth, Bautista came to the plate against brilliant Royals starter Edinson Volquez with two on, and no outs. He worked the count full, then fouled off rocket after rocket: 97 miles per hour, 97, 97, 98. You felt like Toronto’s season was out there, staying alive.\nAnd then Bautista took a curveball at the knees, and he half-waved his bat, and it was called a ball. Bautista, the Greek God Of Telling You What The Strike Zone Is And What It Is Not, starting walking, the way you walk if you’re trying to bluff your way past security.\n“You could argue I got the benefit of a borderline call,” Bautista said, which for him is an extraordinary admission. Asked how confident he was taking the pitch he said, “I wasn’t, but I did. So I was relieved.”\nThe Royals protested, and manager Ned Yost said he couldn’t get an umpire’s attention to appeal because the building was so loud, and MLB’s official web site and Fangraphs both made the pitch look like a strike, while Brooks Baseball did not. Edwin Encarnacion walked too, and two batters later Troy Tulowitzki cleared the bases with a double, healing shoulder blade and all. It was 5-0, and some of the weight came off.\nVolquez told reporters that his catcher, Sal Perez, told him home plate umpire Dan Iassogna had apologized for the non-call on Bautista. Perez told Sam Mellinger of the Kansas City Star that no, that hadn’t happened. Either way, like Ryan Goins letting the ball drop in Game 2, it opened the door. The Jays smashed through.\nAnd still, this could have been a disaster. In the seventh, Jays manager John Gibbons got up David Price in the bullpen, two days before he was scheduled to pitch a hypothetical Game 6. Estrada had allowed two long fly balls in the fifth, and in the sixth he had to carefully navigate a two-out walk, and the safety valve was Price, who was smashed in his only relief appearance in the last five years, against Texas. Price doesn’t even usually throw two days before he pitches. This would have been crazy.\nBut it nearly happened, which tells you a little about Gibbons’ willingness to throw dice with routine and rhythm, and what he thinks of his own bullpen. Estrada got Eric Hosmer to fly out to left, and in so doing he saved the Jays from the Royals, and he saved them from himself.\n“That really worked out perfectly, the fact that we didn’t need David tonight so he could throw Friday,” said Gibbons. “The way our pitching staff and bullpen was lined up today, it couldn’t happen any better.”\nGibbons has two relievers he trusts, and maybe three starters, and he is trying to walk this club back from a 3-1 deficit and to the World Series on a very narrow wire indeed.\nStill, the Jays played their fourth elimination game in 11 days, and they are still playing. Now Price gets another chance at playoff redemption on regular rest in the place where he came undone last week, and if they survive, Marcus Stroman will pitch a Game 7, the city on his shoulders.\n“It’s a lot of pressure, and there’s not a lot of room for mistakes,” said Bautista. “I’d say hopefully, if we get to the World Series, we’re going to take that experience to our advantage.”\nIt’s a narrow wire, but they haven’t fallen yet. They aren’t looking down, either.\nMore on thestar.com\nMaple Leafs lose in shootout to Sabres", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:47:53.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
