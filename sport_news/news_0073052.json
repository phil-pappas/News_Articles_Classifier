As long as the original photo is taken in a garden -- public or private -- in the Pacific Northwest in the last year, it's eligible to win.\nThere will be four winners: Three selected by staff members of The Oregonian and Homes & Gardens of the Northwest and one voted on by the public . The winning photos and some runners-up will appear in the last issue of the Homes & Gardens of the Northwest and displayed on OregonLive.com.\nTen images will be selected by us as finalists and are eligible for your online vote as the People's Choice and fourth place winner.\nTo enter, submit your original digital photo at oregonlive.com/hg-photo between Oct. 21 and Oct. 31, 2015. It's quick and easy, and you can see the other entries.\nIf you have a printed photograph, have it scanned and made into a digital image to submit online.

TIPS AND IDEAS\nUsually, morning or late afternoon light is best. Avoid shooting between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when overhead light is flat. Look for repetition of shapes, reflections, lovely designs in nature. Get close to your subject. Look for clean backgrounds. Good luck!\n -- Janet Eastman\njeastman@oregonian.com\n503-799-8739\n@janeteastman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/janeteastman"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:22:43.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
