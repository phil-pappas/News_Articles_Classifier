He was pumped. He was confident. He was fuming with rage. He screamed. He slammed his tennis racket into the court with frustration. He threw it in the air with elation.\nHe also appeared defeated.\nDown a set and trailing 4-0 in the second in the Class 5A boys tennis No. 1 singles championship match Saturday at the Gates Tennis Center, Smith spiked his racket on the court and received a point penalty for launching a ball nearly over the fence. He scolded himself out loud: \"Kap, have you ever played this bad in your life?\"\nThe pep talk to himself worked. Smith fought back to win the next six games and force the third set.\nThe Boulder sophomore completed his remarkable rally and defeated Cherry Creek junior Ryan James in three sets (5-7, 6-4, 6-4).\n\"I was really nervous in the beginning, but I was excited. And then I kind of calmed down,\" Smith said. \"I broke (James) twice in the first set and I felt really confident, but I lost somehow. That kind of got me frustrated.\"\nSmith was in command during the third set, leaving James without a lot of time to adjust.\n\"When I felt committed to the attack, I played very well,\" James said. \"And then when (Smith) started lobbing it a little bit higher, I felt it took me out of my comfort zone a little bit because I had to come in off a higher ball.\"\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:12:13.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
