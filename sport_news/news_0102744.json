By NATE ALLEN SPECIAL TO THE LOG CABIN \nFAYETTEVILLE — Back in August, Saturday’s Arkansas vs. Auburn SEC West game surely was destined for CBS’ afternoon SEC game of the week or ESPN’s SEC primetime nighttime. \nNow with thunderstorms forecast, it seems the Weather Channel might have the most interest in the game at Reynolds Razorback Stadium relegated to an 11 a.m. kickoff on the SEC Network. \nCoach Gus Malzahn’s 4-2 overall/1-2 in the SEC Auburn Tigers and coach Bret Bielema’s 2-4, 1-2 Razorbacks obviously have not fulfilled the projections of their August preseason AP Top 25 rankings. Auburn in August ranked sixth and Arkansas, 18th. \nHowever both have played better in October than September when the Razorbacks were consecutively upset nonconference in Little Rock and Fayetteville by Toledo and Texas Tech and lost in SEC overtime to Texas A&M at the Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium. While in Auburn, Ala. Auburn was lucky to escape lower FCS division Jacksonville State in overtime and lost SEC games, 45-21 and 17-9 at LSU and in Auburn to Mississippi State. \nFor October, including two weeks ago an open date, Auburn is 2-0, beating San Jose State nonconference and winning 30-27 on Oct. 15 a SEC game at Kentucky. \nArkansas, coming off an open date week, on Oct. 3 beat SEC rival Tennessee, 24-20 in Knoxville, Tenn. and Oct. 10 in Tuscaloosa, Ala. led nationally No. 8 Alabama, the reigning SEC champion, 7-3 into the third quarter before finally losing, 27-14. \nBoth teams are starting to feel better about themselves which makes both teams wary of the other. \n“It was a good win last game versus Kentucky and we have a little momentum an starting to play solid football,” said Malzahn, the Arkansas native and former Arkansas champion high school coach at Hughes, Shiloh Christian and Springdale the 2006 Razorbacks offensive coordinator. “We certainly have our work cut out for us against a very good Arkansas team. Their record is deceiving.” \n“Auburn is a good football team,” Bielema said. \n“Obviously that has had a lot of success with coach Malzahn and everything he brings to the table. They bring a lot of the same things we have seen in the past but offensively (changing quarterbacks from junior Jeremy Johnson to redshirt freshman Sean White), they bring a few more wrinkles and defensively, the change they had in coordinators (hiring Will Muschamp, the former Florida head Coach and before that a renowned defensive coordinator at LSU and Texas) brought new schemes.” \nJohnson was highly touted as last year’s Auburn backup to departed senior Nick Marshall but was benched after three games this season having thrown more interceptions, six, than touchdowns five. White has been intercepted once against zero touchdowns but has moved the Tigers more efficiently. \n“I think their quarterback has played well for them and he’s been a good manager of the game,” Arkansas defensive coordinator Robb Smith said. “He’s made throws when he needed to.” \nAuburn was lavished preseason love primarily on the hiring of Muschamp to masterminded a defense that finished miserably in 2014 as those 8-5 Tigers lost four of their last five. Offensively pundits, always enamored of Malzahn’s no-huddle Spread offense, were sold on the pass-catch potential of Johnson, impressive starting (12 of 16 for 243 yards with two touchdowns and zero picks) the first half against Arkansas last year, and receiver Duke Williams (45 catches for 730 yards and five touchdowns last season). \nWilliams has been kicked off the team, and Johnson benched, while even Muschamp overnight couldn’t turn a leaky defense into a great one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:04:24.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
