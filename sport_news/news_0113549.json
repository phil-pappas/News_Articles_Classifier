The Mustangs scored in overtime to defeat Leyden 1-0 on Oct. 9 on senior night. By PATRICK Z. McGAVIN - editorial@mysuburbanlife.com \nBERWYN – A huge throng of Morton soccer fans lined the west side of the stands, shrieking at the possibility of something positive about to unfold. \nOn senior night Oct. 9, a junior stole the show, with assists from a senior and a sophomore. \nStar senior midfielder Leo Delgado slotted a ball from the right edge to the center that junior midfielder Adan Carriedo collected in stride and blasted for the game-winner, the one-touch rocket helping the Mustangs survive 1-0 against Leyden in overtime. \nThe Mustangs (19-2, 5-0) are on the verge of recording another 20-victory campaign and notched their fourth consecutive unbeaten season in the West Suburban Gold. \nThe game illustrated the depth and versatility of the Mustangs. Leyden coach Mark Valintis designed a defense to contain Delgado and sophomore star Baltazar Duran. It worked – up to a point. \nLeyden bottled the Mustangs’ attack for much of the second half, enjoying superior possession time. \nWhen it came time for Morton to strike, the soft-spoken Carriedo was the beneficiary. Duran and Delgado both played crucial roles. Duran played the ball from the center to the right flank to Delgado, who fed Carriedo. \n“I was confident in putting the ball in front of the net,” Delgado said. \nThe difficulty was not getting too excited about the opportunity on net. \n“Adan was composed and got it in front of the net,” Morton coach Mike Caruso said. “He’s been going over and wide lately but at least this time he hit on the frame.” \nMorton’s offense has been a well-oiled machine this season. The Mustangs attack the ball with speed, precision and power. The Leyden victory showed another, equally important, side of a team capable of gutting out a victory in a game where scoring is at a premium and every mistake is magnified. \nCaruso’s biggest concern was how his inexperienced back line would adjust to the speed and intensity of the game. Behind a rapidly improving Diego Lopez, Juan Sales and Rodrigo Gutierrez, the Mustangs shut down star Eagles forward Albert Arabik and the gifted Leyden attack. \n“I think we’re finally getting to play team defense,” Caruso said. “It’s not just offense all the time. We know we can play offense but you have to play defense first. Tonight we battled their counterattack by coming back and getting two guys on the ball. \n“If we continue our team defense and put the ball in the net we should be in good shape.” \nDelgado reiterated that point. \n“We want to work our way forward,” he said. “This was a really big test for us with a playoff atmosphere and luckily we came out with character and intensity and got the win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:26:45.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
