It is obviously in the player's best interests to avoid the ordeal of a trial conducted under an intense media spotlight.\"\nReal Madrid fans can stop celebrating now.\n[via MARCA ]", "external_links": ["http://www.marca.com/en/2015/10/10/en/football/barcelona/1444465889.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:21:09.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
