Meanwhile, the Cherries will be looking over their shoulder, as only two points separate them from Newcastle, who are in the relegation zone. \nWhere to Watch Live \nKick-off is set for 2:05pm GMT . Highlights of the game will be available on BBC Match of the Day 2 at 10pm GMT on BBC One. \nOverview \nBournemouth come into the game after winning two and losing five of their last nine games in the league and need to get their basics right if they have to keep up their quest for staying in the division beyond the current season. Their last game ended in a 5-1 hammering against Manchester City, who were able to take full advantage of their mistakes and pile the pressure at the back. \nEddie Howe's side have managed to put up better performances in the past and need more consistency if they have to avoid a possible relegation in the near future. They have been badly hit by injuries to key players, with Callum Wilson, Tyrone Mings and Max Gradel all out after damaging their knee ligaments. However, a win over a disjointed Tottenham side, who have not lost in the league since their opening day defeat to Manchester United, will put some much-needed belief in the hearts of the players. \nSpurs were undone by Anderlecht in the group stages of the Europa League, having played some brilliant football against Liverpool in the previous weekend to keep the game to a stalemate. Jurgen Klopp's high pressing game was astutely countered by Mauricio Pochettino's men who were unlucky not to find the back of the net despite many chances. \nTottenham have the best defensive record in the league, having shipped in only seven goals thus far but have won only three games since the start of the season. Harry Kane's form has been under scrutiny, having scored only one goal thus far, albeit in controversial fashion against Manchester City in a famous 4-1 win. \nWhat Managers Say \nEddie Howe: \"[On Harry Kane] Looking at the games he has had chances in all of them. He is still in the right positions but things haven't quite broken his way. I've watched him for a long time now and he always impressed me. I tried to bring him in several times (at Burnley) and tended to miss out. Someone like that I really admire. I watched him a lot coming through the ranks at Tottenham and I remember him playing for Millwall against my Burnley side and he was outstanding.\" \nMauricio Pochettino: \"I will put a strong squad or team out in every game. We analyse the players to see who is fit. The fixture congestion is unlucky and it is like last season when we played the Capital One Cup final. We played West Ham, Fiorentina and Chelsea in one week. We stayed an extra night in Florence.\" \nBetting Odds", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:42:21.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
