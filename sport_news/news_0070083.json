Veteran Leon Hall will likely see some time at safety when the Bengals go to their nickel coverage, which would also open the door for 2014 first-round draft pick Darqueze Dennard to see some time at cornerback. \nAlso made inactive for Sunday's game are: wide receivers Mario Alford and Greg Little; tight end C.J. Uzomah; rookie defensive tackle Marcus Hardison; defensive tackle Brandon Thompson and defensive end Margus Hunt. \nIt marks the fourth straight game that Alford, Little, Uzomah, Hardison and Hunt were made inactive. \nThompson was active for last Sunday's game in Baltimore and played 24 snaps with two tackles, including one for loss. \n\"He was part of some positive plays for the defense,\" Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis said of Thompson on Monday. \"He did a nice job staying on his feet in the running game and made a couple plays there; like the screen play. There were some positives from Brandon (against the Ravens). \nThe return of defensive tackle Pat Sims led to Thompson being made inactive. Sims missed last Sunday's game in Baltimore due to a hip injury. \nCornerback Chris Lewis-Harris is active after being inactive the last two weeks. He was active for the opener in Oakland. \nCHIEFS INACTIVES: The Chiefs made the following seven players inactive for Sunday's game: quarterback Aaron Murray; wide receiver Albert Wilson; cornerback Steven Nelson; linebacker Desman Moses; offensive lineman Jah Reid; tight end Brian Parker and defensive lineman Rakeem Nunez-Roches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:42:38.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
