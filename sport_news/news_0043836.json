Golden was the Steelers' special teams captain in 2014 and looks to bring more leadership to the unit this season. \"For my peers to vote me to be a captain of the team, that speaks volumes to what they think of me,” Golden said. \nSTEELERS GAME DAY \nWeek 6: vs. Arizona Cardinals, Heinz Field (68,400) \nToday, 1 p.m., (FOX) \nRadio: WDVE-FM (102.5), WMBA-AM (1230), WBVP-AM (1460) \nLine: Cardinals by 3, over/under 44.5 \nWeather: 50 degrees, mostly cloudy \nMEMORABLE MOMENT \nOct. 9, 1988 \nSun Devil Stadium \nIn Week 6 at Tempe, the Steelers made their first trip to the Valley of the Sun after the Cardinals relocated after spending the previous 28 years in St. Louis. After Phoenix -- yes, they were known as the Phoenix Cardinals for their first six seasons in Arizona -- took a 7-0 lead, Rod Woodson countered with a 92-yard kickoff return for a TD, the second of his Hall of Fame career. However, the Cardinals then reeled off 24 straight points as Neil Lomax completed 17 of 26 for 291 yards and three TDs, two of them to J.T. Hill, and Roy Green had four catches for 119 yards. The Steelers' Todd Blackledge and Steve Bono split time at quarterback, combining for 141 yards on 11 of 31 passes, including Bono's 12-yard toss to Merrill Hoge in the fourth quarter. The win improved the Cardinals to 4-2 but they finished their first season in Arizona at 7-9 in the NFC East. The Steelers finished the '88 season at 5-11, their fewest wins to date and fewest since 1970, Chuck Noll's second season as coach. \nBIG QUESTION \nDo the Steelers need to get Antonio Brown the ball more? \nSure, they'd like to. They'd also like to win every game 75-0 and have every day be 72 degrees and sunny. It's just not realistic. As long as Mike Vick is at quarterback the Steelers are going to have to try to win by scratching out some ugly games. If that means playing it safe and running Le'Veon Bell 25-plus times and winning a field position battle, so be it. If that means Brown doesn't get 10 catches and 150 receiving yards, also so be it. Vick has a big arm but he's inaccurate with it in an offense that he's not fully acclimated to. Not turning the ball over trumps massaging anyone's ego. That said, if a wide receiver doesn't want the ball every play, he's probably not very good receiver to begin with. Whether Brown should have gone public with his dirty laundry? That's another matter. \nKEY MATCHUP \nSteelers WR Antonio Brown vs. Cardinals secondary \nBrown made it clear this week that he wants to get the ball more, having caught just three passes in the Steelers win over the Chargers. He’s going to have his work cut out for him this week against a Cardinals secondary that has intercepted 11 passes and returned three of them for touchdowns. Having Martavis Bryant back could take some coverage away from Brown, but it will be up to Brown to get open and for QB Mike Vick to find a way to get him the ball. \nBREAKDOWN \nWhen the Cardinals have the ball ... \nThe Steelers will have to find a way to do something that few have been able to do through five games, and that’s slow down a Cardinals offense that is averaging 38 points per game. QB Carson Palmer has been sacked just seven times this year, so the Steelers will need to use their pass rush to try and get pressure on Palmer and knock off the timing with his receivers. The Steelers will have to continue to rally to the ball and gang tackle on running plays, something LB Lawrence Timmons believes they did a better job of doing last week. “It was a great team effort, at all levels of the ball,” Timmons said. “It was real big in the game when we got that fumble, and it just carried over to big plays for us.” \nWhen the Steelers have the ball ... \nThe Steelers will need to continue to get the ball into the hands of Le’Veon Bell, who has been their best player since QB Ben Roethlisberger went down. In the three games since he returned from his suspension, Bell has rushed for 302 yards and three touchdowns. Having Martavis Bryant in the lineup for the first time this season should also give QB Mike Vick another threat in the passing game. The Steelers also know they will need to protect the football against a Cardinals defense that has racked up 13 takeaways through the first five games. “I know I have to do a great job protecting the ball, because every time they tackle, they’re going for it,” Bell said. “That’s what makes them a great defense.” \nQ&A: With safety ROBERT GOLDEN \nAs told to Times Steelers Writer Chris Bradford: \nCB: With Will Allen likely out, does your mindset or preparation change? \nRG: \"Just getting ready to go out there as a starter as of now. Not too sure what Will Allen's circumstances are, just going to be prepared and ready to go. Just like every other week.\" \nCB: This could be your first career start, does the experience of last week, you played a lot (67 snaps), give you more confidence? \nRG: \"At the end of the day, it's all about wins and losses. I was happy with that. Just happy to get the victory. I knew the standard and just tried to hold up to it.\" \nCB: So you're the \"next man up?\" \nRG: \"Coach Tomlin always preaches the standard is the standard around here. I just have to go out there and help this team get a victory.\" \nCB: This is your fourth year in the league, is this an opportunity for you? \nRG: \"Definitely. Whenever you get an opportunity to go out there and show what you can do for this team, it's definitely an opportunity you want to take advantage of.\" \nCB: Do you believe the defense is starting to come around? \n\"If you look at all the games, we've been playing pretty good. I see Tom Brady put up 28 points on us, he's been putting 50 on everyone else. We've been holding other guys down, limiting points as well. We're just trying to get better each and every week. That's our goal.\" \nNOTEWORTHY Larry Fitzgerald is one of the best wide receivers of his generation but for advice the Cardinals' eight-time Pro Bowler turns to Tom Moore, a man who knows some things about receiving great from previous generation. Arizona's 76-year-old assistant head coach Moore is credited with developing Hall of Famers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth during his time as the Steelers' wide receivers coach from 1977-82. \"I'm always bombarding him with questions about those guys,\" Fitzgerald said. \"He's a walking, talking encyclopedia.\" Fitzgerald says Moore talks about the evolving nature of the game and the leadership those Steelers teams had and still have. \"James Harrison comes in, he learns from Joey Porter,\" Fitzgerald said. \"Now, Jarvis Jones learns from James Harrison. That veteran leadership continues to trickle on down and it's become the Steelers way. We'd love to be able to have that same (continuity) down the road for the Cardinals.\" Marcus Gilbert says his job doesn't change whether he's pass protecting right-handed QB Ben Roethlisberger or left-handed QB Mike Vick. The only difference is that Gilbert, a right tackle, now has Vick's blindside. \"My focus is on keeping the quarterback upright no matter if it's blindside or not,\" Gilbert said. \"We all have a goal, we all have to get our job done. I can't be concerned whether it's blindside or not. We're facing a great pass rush on either side. It's all about us going out there and making plays and playing team protection, just getting a win.\" The Steelers are 1-1 with Vick as the starter but he's been sacked nine times. When asked what his favorite memory was of Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians’ time in Pittsburgh, QB Ben Roethlisberger, without hesitation, mentioned the two Super Bowls the Steelers won with Arians on staff, one as the wide receivers coach and the other as the offensive coordinator. But it wasn't so much what transpired on the field, but what happened off the field that made Arians and Roethlisberger’s relationship a special one. “I lived by him down south, and just had a lot of fun, all the stories,” Roethlisberger said. “He’s been coaching for a long time, a lot of different people at a lot of different levels, so it’s always fun to just sit down and listen to some stories.” Although Arians left the Steelers four years ago, he and Roethlisberger still talk to one another at times, as Arians reached out to Roethlisberger when he went down with his knee injury two weeks ago against the Rams. “We texted back and forth,” Arians said. “I called him that night just to let him know how we felt about him and was sorry for it.” Players may leave Pittsburgh, but the bond that they create with their teammates never goes away. That statement rings true for LB Lawrence Timmons and former Steelers teammate LaMarr Woodley, now with the Cardinals. Timmons and Woodley were the first two draft picks by coach Mike Tomlin, and were both big pieces in two Super Bowl runs in Pittsburgh. Woodley, who battled injuries in his last few seasons in Pittsburgh, is now healthy and is listed as a starter on the Cardinals depth chart, recording one sack in five games. “Wood is always going to be a brother to us,” Timmons said. “We came in together, so just seeing him do well is a great thing for me to see, and I’m sure he’s going to play well for them.” This week’s matchup may seem like the ideal one for the Cardinals secondary, as they face a quarterback in Mike Vick who has struggled with timing with his receivers in two starts. The Cardinals lead the league with 11 interceptions through five games, but don't expect them to just sit on routes and expect Vick to throw it to them. “If you sit on routes with their speed they’re going to beat you deep,” Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians said. Vick only had one pass intercepted last week against the Chargers and that came on a Hail Mary at the end of the first half, but he could've easily thrown three others if it weren't for drops by Chargers’ defensive backs. Arians says the key is not only to be in the right position when the ball is throw, but to make the play too. “For us it’s to protect the deep ball, and if they have to throw one just don't drop it,” Arians said. Chris might be the better known Johnson among Arizona running backs -- he's one of only seven players to rush for 2,000 yards in a season -- but David is doing something unique as well. David Johnson, a third-round pick, is the first rookie since Hall of Famer Gale Sayers (Chicago, 1965) to record two rushing TDs, two receiving TDs and a kickoff return for a TD in his team's first five games. \nPREDICTION \nNo team has put up more points this season than Arizona (190) and only six have yielded fewer points than the Cardinals. That adds up to a very difficult task for a Steelers offense that, save for the fourth quarter in San Diego, has struggled to generate much scoring and a defense that will face yet another QB in Carson Palmer, who might not be considered elite but whose numbers this season suggest otherwise. Ben Roethlisberger won't play and it's questionable whether the Steelers could win even if he did ...

It’s no different than me going back to Minneapolis to play the Vikings. I’m not there for pleasantries. I’m there to try to get a win. I have a lot of fond memories of people from Pittsburgh.\" \nLarry Fitzgerald, Arizona WR and former Pitt star \n--- \n\"It’s very important. I am still working on it. This week we said we aren’t going to put an emphasis on it. We said we are just going to let everything happen naturally, and go out there and play to win. And that’s the most important thing.\" \nMike Vick, QB, on importance of getting WR Antonio Brown the ball \n---- \n\"You can't keep Seven on the sideline. But we have to keep winning.
