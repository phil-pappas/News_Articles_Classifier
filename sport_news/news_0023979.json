(Christy Cabrera Chirinos) \nOdogwu also saw a few reps at left tackle while Isidora shifted back to right tackle for a few plays. \nOn its depth chart released ahead of the Clemson game, Miami listed Trevor Darling as the starting left tackle ahead of Tyree St. Louis, McDermott as the starting left guard ahead of Tyler Gauthier, Nick Linder as the starting center ahead of Hunter Knighton, Brown as the starting right guard ahead of Alex Gall, and Isidora ahead of Odogwu at right tackle. \nOn Tuesday, Miami offensive coordinator James Coley said it was the same basic group of seven – Darling, McDermott, Linder, Brown, Odogwu, Gall and Isidora – competing for starting jobs as the Hurricanes continue searching for the right fit. Golden is happy with his quarterback \nBrad Kaaya lead the Hurricanes to a 30-20 win over Virginia Tech \nBrad Kaaya lead the Hurricanes to a 30-20 win over Virginia Tech See more videos \n“Part of the rotation is that no one has really solidified their spot,” Coley said. “We are competing. We have guys that we’ve recruited with similar body types and athleticism that we know can play inside or outside. We’re trying to solidify those five spots. They can compete for it. We can’t continue to have certain penalties that we’re having and part of that is finding the right guys to step up and take ownership and earn their spots.” \nThere’s no denying Miami’s offensive line has had its struggles through Miami’s first six games. \nThough the Hurricanes have allowed just seven sacks, quarterback Brad Kaaya has gotten hit far more than Miami would like. And against Florida State and Virginia Tech, the running game hasn’t been what it was early in the season. The Seminoles held Miami to just 20 total rushing yards while Virginia Tech held Miami to 124 yards on a meager 2.5 yards per play. \nPenalties, as Coley referenced, have been problematic too. \nMiami linemen were whistled for four false starts against the Hokies, prompting some work on that front during the early portion of Tuesday’s practice – and some strong words from coach Al Golden and Kaaya immediately after Saturday’s win. \nTuesday, Coley shared that yes, penalized linemen were facing consequences at practice, though he declined to specify how. Darling told the Miami Herald, however, that linemen whistled in games have to do 250 up-downs, while jumping in practice earns them 50 of the same exercise. \nFor his part, Coley gets his frustration with the line out in a different way. \n“It helps me,” he smiled when asked about yelling at the penalized linemen. \nBurns honored \nCorner Artie Burns, a junior, was named the ACC Defensive Back of the Week on Monday after his two-interception effort against the Hokies. One of those picks came late in the fourth quarter and helped seal the Coastal Division win for the Hurricanes. \nBurns’ two picks were a career high and brought his season total to five. His five interceptions are the most by a Hurricane since Sean Taylor had 10 in 2003. \n“To be behind one of the greats is good,” Burns said Tuesday. “But we’ve got a long season ahead. I can’t really hold on to all the moments. You have to keep going, chopping down each game one at a time.” \nIt’d be big…but how big? \nThe Hurricanes understand they have a huge opportunity Saturday when Clemson visits Sun Life Stadium. Miami hasn’t beaten a top-10 team since 2009 when the then 17 th -ranked Hurricanes upset No. 8 Oklahoma. An unranked Miami team hasn’t beaten a top 10 team since 1998 when Edgerrin James ran for 299 yards and the Hurricanes upset third-ranked UCLA in a classic thriller at the Orange Bowl. \nQuite a few fans that day managed to rush the field and celebrate with Miami’s players, but the current Hurricanes aren’t sure whether that’d be a solid way to celebrate if the Hurricanes upset the Tigers. \nThat said, they know what this game would mean for the program. \n“It’d be a real big win. It’d be a huge win for the program. But I’m not really sure how the fans will react. I just know it’s a huge game for us,” safety Deon Bush said. “That’s what we came to Miami for, those types of wins. We’re really preparing for this moment now. We’re trying to play in the moment now.” \nGame time announced \nThe ACC announced Monday that Miami’s Oct. 31 game at Duke is set for a 7 p.m. kick. \nThe game will be broadcast on either ESPN2 or ESPNU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:09:02.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
