(Chris Russell / Columbus Dispatch) Associated Press \nOhio State remained No. 1 in the Associated Press college football top 25 and tied a poll record Sunday, despite lagging support from the voters. \nMeanwhile, No. 2 Texas Christian and No. 3 Baylor edged forward, No. 4 Michigan State slipped and No. 5 Utah and No. 6 Clemson took big jumps. \nAfter four top-10 teams lost on Saturday, the rankings were rattled and five teams received first-place votes. The Buckeyes received 38 first-place votes, their fewest this season after beginning as the first unanimous preseason No. 1. TCU has five first-place votes, Baylor received 10, Utah has seven and No. 9 Texas A&M has one. \nOhio State was the only team in the top 16 to have the same ranking this week as last. \nThe Buckeyes held off Indiana, 34-27, on Saturday and have now been top-ranked 101 times, matching Oklahoma for the most in the 79-year history of the media poll. \nGeorgia QB keeps job \nGeorgia Coach Mark Richt says he's sticking with Greyson Lambert as the Bulldogs' starting quarterback. \nLambert completed just 10 of 24 passes for 86 yards in a 38-10 loss to Alabama. Brice Ramsey also got some playing time, but he completed only one pass and had two interceptions. \nReceiver Isaiah McKenzie (left hamstring) and center Brandon Kublanow (sprained ankle) are questionable for Saturday's game against Tennessee. Georgia (4-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) plunged from eighth to No. 19 in the latest Associated Press rankings. \nSurgery for Spartan \nMichigan State defensive back RJ Williamson will miss an extended period of time after having surgery Sunday on a torn biceps. \nWilliamson, a fifth-year senior, has intercepted two passes this season for the fourth-ranked Spartans. \nMichigan State plays at Rutgers on Saturday night. \nMORE SPORTS NEWS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:46:53.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
