When she goes to the State Swimming and Diving Championships later this fall, Jinnae Jang, along with coach Mark Carvalho, will have to decide which events she competes in. The Durfee junior has already qualified in the 50-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle, 200-yard freestyle, and backstroke. Accordingly she has also chalked up more than a few wins along the way this season. On Thursday against power Bishop Feehan (6-0), Jang won both of her individual events – the 50 freestyle (26.69) and 100 backstroke (1:06.04) – in Durfee’s 91-84 Southern Conference loss. “Jinnae definitely has the potential to be in the top 10, or five, in the state, in the 50 free, maybe the 100 free, or the 100 back. We’re still kind of feelings those things out,” Carvalho said. “She definitely has a lot of potential to possibly be within that.” Jang said her favorite event is the 50 freestyle and she’d like to swim 25 seconds. “My expectations is just to try my best,” she said. Jang’s two wins against Feehan were tight races. In the 50 freestyle, she topped Feehan’s Maddie McLaughlin by 0.89 seconds. In the backstroke, she edged Feehan’s Hannah Nitso (1:06.37) by .33 seconds. “Jinnae’s got a great work ethic and she’s got just a great attitude about just training and just going after meet,” Carvalho said. “And whether she has a bad race or a great race, it doesn’t really affect her next race. “A great teammate. She’s always the first one here, last one to leave. Always just a positive motivator.” Feehan swam exhibition (taking no points) after opening a 91-46 lead through the 200 freestyle relay. Durfee’s 200 free relay team of Gabby Paiva, Laura Gaudette, Sarah Carvalho, and Nicole Ferreira took first place when Feehan’s top team was disqualified. “Overall it’s a little bit of a tough meet for us,” Carvalho said, “because things kind of wear on you after you see their 1-2-3, 1-2-3. But yeah, we had some great times. We’re swimming a lot of girls in off events for this meet because we don’t have the pressure of trying to win the meet. “It’s like let’s see who can do this and who can do that. That helps us feel things out for the Big 3 tri-meet, or the championship meet. It just gives me more options instead of swimming the same lineup all the time. Durfee freshman Jaelin Jang, Jinnae’s sister, took second place in the 500 freestyle (6:05.37). Gaudette (174.05 points) was second in the diving. Feehan’s lone entry in the diving, defending state champion Hannah Phelan, scored 268.30. Page 2 of 2 - Email Greg Sullivan at gsullivan@heraldnews.com.
