In all, Fukuda is said to have lost more than $8,000. \nThe 32-year-old pitcher did not appear for the top team this season, so there is no suspicion that he fixed games, but gambling is a violation of NPB’s charter. \nIn light of the revelations, team president Hiroshi Kubo on Tuesday launched an investigation involving all players and staff. \nThe Giants have also suspended pitcher Shoki Kasahara, who introduced Fukuda to an employee at a tax accounting firm who enticed him to bet on games. \nThe suspensions come as the Giants are preparing for their first game of the postseason on Saturday. \nOwner Kojiro Shiraishi met with the team on Tuesday, calling the situation “disgraceful and extremely disappointing.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:18:39.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
