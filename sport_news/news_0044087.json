Ben Gray / bgray@ajc.com “My motives were pure. I wanted to get down to what we were doing in our day-to-day operations,” May told residents at the Lou Walker Senior Center in Lithonia. “I got something different than that. … I’m still upset.”\nOne citizen, Audrey Hinds, said May needs to be held accountable for the investigation that resulted in calls for his resignation.\n“Do you take responsibility for your leadership?” Hinds asked. “You called them in” to conduct the investigation.\nBen Gray Residents greet interim DeKalb County CEO Lee May following a Tuesday evening October 13, 2015 forum at the Lou Walker Senior Center in Lithonia. Ben Gray / bgray@ajc.com May said he has to live with his decision to hire the investigators, Mike Bowers and Richard Hyde, and he asked residents to read their report and assess its findings. He said he’ll do the same and work to improve services to residents.\nThe meeting was the first opportunity for residents to confront May since an investigative report on DeKalb corruption called for him to resign was released Sept. 30.\nMay acknowledged that he’s spent “quiet time” pondering his political future, and he has previously said he won’t step down unless he’s asked to by the taxpayers of the county. May, who was appointed by Gov. Nathan Deal as CEO more than two years ago, will face an election next year.\nLloyd Alaman said he still supports May.\n“To me this whole ordeal is nothing more than a witch hunt,” Alaman said. “We stand behind you, and please do not resign.”\nThe corruption report faulted May and other elected officials for “a stunning lack of leadership” that destroyed public confidence in the integrity of the county’s government.\nThe report took aim at May for suspicions about county-paid repairs to his flooded house, expenses he made on a business trip to Hawaii and money he borrowed from a subordinate.\nMay told residents Tuesday that the repairs were the county’s responsibility, he paid for personal travel expenses, and his borrowing of small amounts wasn’t inappropriate.\n“I need you to hear it from me: I’ve never taken any money. I’ve never stolen any money,” May said.\nBut some residents called on May to answer for problems beyond those cited in the corruption report.\nThey asked May what he was going to do about crime, litter and a lack of enough jobs.\n“I’ve seen this county go from wonderful to worse than awful,” said Sandy Morris. “Why should I stay here? I have to fight to get services. I want to see some action or I’m gone.”\nCharles Peagler told May he made a mistake when he spent so much of taxpayers’ money on the investigation when residents, especially in South DeKalb, believe those funds could have been better spent on improving their communities.\n“That money could have been used to clean up the county,” Peagler told May. “You have to take care of your home first.”\nUpcoming community meetings\nInterim DeKalb County CEO May plans to talk with residents during seven more community meetings. Each meeting will take place from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, Tucker-Reid Cofer Library Oct. 20, Derwin Brown Memorial South Precinct in Decatur Oct. 22, Welcome Friend Baptist Church in Ellenwood Oct. 26, Maloof Auditorium in Decatur Oct. 27, Dunwoody City Hall Nov. 3, Stonecrest Library Nov. 5, Brookhaven City Hall", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/13/fd/e9/101415-may-forum-BG2.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/13/d6/31/101415-may-forum-BG6.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:33:18.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
