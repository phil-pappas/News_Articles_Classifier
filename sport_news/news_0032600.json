One was a deep pass from quarterback Cody Calash to wide receiver Bradley Johnson. \n\"It's something we worked on during the week,\" Montville coach Tanner Grove said. \"We went to those two guys in the locker room (at halftime) and said, 'If we see what we think we're going to see, we're going to run this and we're going to score and put the game at a two-score game.'\" \nThe Indians did just that. \nAfter scoring on the final play of the first half, with all zeroes on the clock, the Montville High School football team scored on the first play of the second half Saturday night, 63 yards from Calash to Johnson, to give the Indians a 14-0 lead on the way to a 21-7 victory over New London. \nThe other thing Montville worked on during the week was how to stop New London wide receiver Major Roman, who, at 6-foot-5, is a Division I prospect. The Indians did that, too, limiting Roman to one catch for minus-one yard. \n\"It takes the whole week,\" Grove said. \"Do you put one guy on (Roman)? Two guys? Three guys? In some sets he lines up as tight end, in some the slot, in some the split. You put all your efforts into, 'Where's 80?'\" \nIn a game which had more of a defensive pace to it — Montville had 166 yards offense to 152 for New London — Montville capitalized just enough on its opportunities to hand New London (1-4) its fourth straight loss since a week one victory over East Lyme. Montville is 3-1. \nWith New London not moving the ball at all on the ground, the pressure was on quarterback Melquan Gomez, a lefty, who at one juncture in the second half passed or intended to pass on every play of an 11-play drive (he completed seven, threw three incompletions and and was sacked once). \nGomez was 17-for-28 for 130 yards and one interception. New London's Giovanni Lopez caught 10 passes for 89 yards. \nOne reason Gomez wasn't even more successful in the second half, when he threw 19 times, was the defense of Montville strong safety and senior captain Tyler Price. Price, the one who dragged down Roman for the 1-yard loss, also had two crucial pass breakups in the second half. \nIn all, Grove said he's OK with Montville putting the game on the shoulders of the defense and special teams. \n\"The entire defense played great,\" Price said. \"The defensive line put pressure on their quarterback and made him make some throws he didn't want to make. They made our job easy for us at DB. \n\"This win means a lot. We know they had a good team and we had to fight. That (play to start the second half) was crucial. We just took the intensity from the locker room and came out and showed it on the field.\" \nMontville's Austin Glidden carried the ball 25 times for 71 yards and a 1-yard touchdown, scoring for the Indians as the clock ran out in the first half. The Indians took over at the New London 28 with 4 minutes, 34 seconds to play after New London's Jacob Commander was forced to punt from his own end zone. \nMontville, then leading 14-0 after the first play of the third quarter, scored its final points with 2:21 remaining in the game, needing to go only 29 yards on that drive after New London fumbled away a punt. Calash kept it for a 3-yard touchdown run. \nNew London scored with 1:15 left on a 7-yard touchdown run by Gomez. \nNew London coach Duane Maranda, whose team reached the playoffs last year before graduating nearly everyone, including two Division I linemen, said it's been a hard process for his team to learn to lose, although he certainly doesn't want the Whalers to get used to it. \n\"As coaches, we know what we need to get done,\" Maranda said. \"But as a kid, it's result-oriented. We just have to do a better job doing everything we can to improve. We have to put the kids in position to try to be successful.\" \nv.fulkerson@theday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:08:25.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
