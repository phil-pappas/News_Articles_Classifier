The guys were blocking well and gave me time.\n\"We just know as seniors that it's our last year and we want to make a good run for the playoffs. We can't lose another game.\"\nWheat Ridge coach Stacy Coryell said he respected GW's athletic talent.\n\"We didn't want this to turn into a track meet,\" Coryell said. \"We had to get a hold of them early.\"\nThey did. The Farmers punted on the opening series, then took over.\nWheat Ridge's Carlos Shippley picked off the Pats' Javian Byrd on the next series and the rout was on.\nPayton Dietrich scored on a 2-yard run and Tate followed with a 1-yard scoring run. GW was guilty of snapping the ball over its punter's head and out of the end zone on consecutive possessions, and the Farmers used a late barrage in the second quarter to build a 33-0 halftime lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:30:01.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
