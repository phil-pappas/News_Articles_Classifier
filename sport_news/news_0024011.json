Their series is bigger than the Ashes,\" he said. File photo: Zaheer Abbas (right) with Syed Kirmani \nZaheer, who is in Abu Dhabi for the Pakistan and England Test match, lamented that there was no international cricket being played in his country. \n\"It is a shame this is the situation. It is unfortunate that Younis Khan set a new batting record for his country in a 'home' series but outside Pakistan,\" Zaheer, a former captain, said. \nZaheer, who was elected as ICC president this year, said at the moment Pakistan cricket had no home venue. \n\"We don't have any home ground at the moment. Our youngsters and fans are deprived off the chance to watch and meet their heroes in their own country,\" he said. \nZaheer said that due to no international cricket being held here since 2009, a huge vaccum had been created in Pakistan cricket. \"It has made a difference to our cricket to our young players they don't get to play international teams at home.\" \nZaheer was however optimistic that the security situation was improving in Pakistan. \"The way our people thronged to the Gaddafi stadium to watch the matches against Zimbabwe shows how much they are missing witnessing international matches at home.\" \nZaheer said the day international teams return to Pakistan a lot of things would become easier for Pakistan cricket authorities. Zaheer hoped that Younis, who broke Javed Miandad's long standing record for the most Test runs in Abu Dhabi yesterday, would score many more runs and break more records. \n\"He is our pride and I wish to see him scoring not 10,000 but 15,000 Test runs and at home as well,\" Zaheer said. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:19:33.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
