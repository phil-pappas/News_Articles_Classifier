Brayden Schenn scored to help the Flyers win for the first time in three games this season. Neuvirth replaced Mason after Florida scored four goals in a 7-1 victory Saturday night. Mason left the team Monday because of unspecified personal reasons, giving Neuvirth the chance to shut down the Panthers from the opening faceoff. He had his first shutout since March 11, 2012, against Toronto. Philadelphia coach Dave Hakstol won for the first time in the NHL game after spending 11 seasons coaching North Dakota. The college-to-pros move in the NHL is a rare one. Hakstol was the first to make the jump since Bob Johnson went from Wisconsin to the Calgary Flames in 1982.
