He's just had a strong season. He's a guy that we like. The fact that we needed a veteran presence to come in and lead this staff, especially when (Adam Wainwright) went down, and John Lackey has been that guy, not just in experience, but in the way he's gone about his business, and the way he has pitched.\"\nThe manager declined to name the starters after Lackey, along with any other postseason roster decisions.\n\"Why should I?\" Matheny said. \"I know it's a hot topic, and I get it. Believe me, it's been something, since that day in Pittsburgh, we really hadn't tried to distract ourselves with getting too far ahead. But since then, it's been non-stop. I think everybody who follows the team closely realizes there are a lot of decisions that need to be made there. We haven't taken it lightly. We've spent a lot of hours trying to figure out what is going to be best for this club. But it's something we don't have to really put on paper until Friday.\"\nMatheny confirmed he has started the process of informing players of their postseason fate. He predicted the postseason roster could be ready to be made public by Thursday's workout.\n(c)2015 St. Louis Post-Dispatch\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1734179&h=Cardinals%27+Matheny+names+Lackey+starter+for+Game+1", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1734179&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1734179"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:14:42.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
