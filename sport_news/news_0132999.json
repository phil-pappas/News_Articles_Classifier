Authorities have not said whether she was armed.\nShortly before 5 p.m., deputies responded to a disturbance at The Patrician apartments in the 18000 block of Southwest Shaw Street, said Sgt. David Thompson, a sheriff's office spokesman. At least one deputy fired shots, striking the woman, Thompson said.\nThompson didn't say where or how many times the woman was shot. No deputies were injured.\nOfficer Involved Shooting In Aloha Washington County Sheriff's deputies responded to a report of a disturbance at 18000 SW Shaw Street. A woman was shot after at least one deputy opened fire. She was taken to OHSU Hospital with gunshot wounds. It is unclear what led to the shooting.\nThe Washington County Major Crimes Team is investigating.\nThe incident represents the agency's second officer-involved shooting this year. In January, a 47-year-old Aloha man was killed after pointing a handgun at a deputy responding to a domestic violence call. The district attorney's office later determined that the shooting was justified .\nNeighbor Dani√© Lionberger, 31, said she was inside her apartment when she heard five gunshots in a row.\nIris Galindo works at a store across the street from the apartments. She was on her lunch break when she also heard five shots.\nShe left the store and saw police with a shield approach someone on the sidewalk. The cops bent downward, she said, and it appeared as if they were helping someone who was hurt.\nGalindo's son was nearby with a babysitter. After hearing the shots, she called the babysitter to make sure they were safe.\nSince then, police from multiple county agencies have descended on the large complex.\nRobert Haggard, 27, came home from running errands to find the police at the apartments.\nOne of the officers let him use his phone, so he could call his wife, who was inside their unit, Haggard said. She had been playing with their kids and hadn't heard anything, he said.\nPolice told him it would be hours before he could return to his apartment.\n-- Rebecca Woolington and Nuran Alteir", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:39:31.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
