(AP) - A second man has been charged with murder in the slaying of the wife of a former professional hockey player from upstate New York. \nThe Steuben (stoo-BEHN’) County Sheriff’s Office announced over the weekend that 44-year-old Michael Beard of Elmira had been arraigned on second-degree murder charges in the death of 35-year-old Kelley Clayton. \nAuthorities say she was killed last Tuesday inside her home in the town of Caton, on the Pennsylvania border just west of Elmira. Her husband, 37-year-old Thomas Clayton, was also charged with murder. \nOfficials say Beard is an acquaintance of Thomas Clayton. \nPolice haven’t said how Kelley Clayton was killed or discussed a motive. \nThomas Clayton played for Elmira’s minor league hockey team. \nHe and Beard are being held in the county jail without bail. It couldn’t be determined if they have lawyers. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:09:40.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
