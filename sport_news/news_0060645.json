On a play that started with a Mt. Hebron turnover on the right wing, Centennial senior Michael Merkey got control of the ball and proceeded to fire a hard shot off a defender’s head into the back of the net. \nWith that goal, it marked the first time Mt. Hebron has trailed since it lost in overtime against River Hill on Sept. 17. \nCentennial nearly got another a few minutes later, as the Vikings’ Daniel Obeng needed to head a ball off the goal line to keep the team’s deficit at just one. \nJust as things were looking bleak, however, Oh stepped up and made a play. Off a long free kick by Jacob Parrott, Oh redirected a header into the back of the net with 3:17 left before halftime. \n“It was really frustrating to watch us play those first 35 minutes and a lot of that had to do with Centennial playing so well. We didn't come out hard and they really made us pay by dominating play,” Mike Linsenmeyer said. “We were very fortunate to get into the half tied 1-1 and you have to credit Jacob and Lucas for making a great play there. That definitely changed some of the momentum.” \nThings went back-and-forth in the opening 12 minutes of the second half. \nMt. Hebron took its first lead of the game, 2-1, when Jared Simowitz came off the bench to score eight minutes out of the break. Just three minutes later, though, Centennial answered when Ammar Narmouq converted a penalty kick to tie the game back up 2-2. \nThat left Johnny Linsenmeyer in a position to play hero. The junior midfielder collected a ball near the top of the box on the right side and proceeded to fire a hard shot into the far side of the net midway through the second half. \n“It just happened to fall in my lap and I just got ahold of it. And then luckily it went in,” Johnny Linsenmeyer said. \nNursing a one-goal lead, Mt. Hebron relied on its defense to do the rest. Obeng and Michael Yacynych both made big plays in the air down the stretch, but no one was bigger than Manasterli. The Vikings’ goalie was everywhere, particularly in the final five minutes as Centennial pushed everyone forward. \n“I just stay on my line and I trust my back line to do what they have to do. Then, when I need to do something, I just react,” Manasterli said. \nIt was a diving save on the left post by Manasterli with 10 seconds left — on a play that started with a long free kick by Centennial’s Tom Brown — that closed the game out. \nMt. Hebron has games against Glenelg, Wilde Lake and Long Reach left on its schedule. Centennial, meanwhile, still has regular season games left against Wilde Lake, Oakland Mills, Glenelg and Reservoir. \nMt. Hebron 3, Centennial 2 \nGoals: MH – Oh, Simowitz, Linsenmeyer; C – Merkey, Narmouq. \nAssists: MH – Parrot, Palin. \nSaves: MH – Manasterli 10; C – Fowler 4. \nHalf: 1-1. \nOther scores: \nHammond 1, Marriotts Ridge 0 \nDarren Ketchum scored the lone goal of the game for the Golden Bears, while goalie Simon Bradford made 10 saves to secure the shutout. \nLong Reach 1, Reservoir 0 \nQuentin Valiente scored the game winner with roughly 15 minutes left in the second half off an assist from Eddie Sanchez. The win was the second straight for the Lightning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:02:40.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
