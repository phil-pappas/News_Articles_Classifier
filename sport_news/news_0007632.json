The message was addressed to fans as a note from Kardashian. \nThe blog-like apps offer first-person postings with photos and advice. Announcing a posting black-out is a rarity for the family, who meticulously document their lives on various social media channels and on the “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” television show. \nMeanwhile, Mercer had issued her own statement Friday to thank the public for its support, saying they’re family was focused on Odom’s “complete healing.” \n“No words can express the overwhelming gratitude we feel for the outpouring of support from around the world,” the statement issued Friday said. \nAlston said Mercer is the sister of Odom’s late mother who helped raise him in New York, where she still lives. Mercer and other family members are now in Las Vegas. \nThe statement said: “His complete healing is paramount and our primary focus.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:46:41.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
