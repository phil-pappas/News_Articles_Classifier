Five former players and recruits tell ESPN's \"Outside the Lines\" that they attended parties at a campus dorm between 2010 and 2014 that featured strippers paid for by the team's former graduate assistant coach. One of the players says he had sex with a dancer after she had been paid. Head coach Rick Pitino tells the \"Louisville Courier-Journal\" that he is devastated and disappointed by the news. A school spokesperson tells ESPN that Athletic Director Tom Jurich said Pitino had no knowledge of the allegations and has no plans to step down. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"show\", \"id\" : 26746645, \"name\" : \"The Sports Tank\", \"description\" : \"Join Tank and J.P. each Saturday for local, college and pro sports news and opinion\", \"slug\" : \"139-The-Sports-Tank\" } } \nSelf-proclaimed former escort Katina Powell released a book earlier this month entitled, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen.\" In the book, the 42-year-old details nearly two dozen sex and strip parties inside Billy Minardi Hall from 2010 to 2014. In an interview that aired on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" today, Powell said she has no proof that Pitino was aware of what was going on, but questioned how he could not know with so many recruits, dancers, loud music, alcohol, security and cameras inside a campus dorm. \nPHOTO: Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:14:47.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
