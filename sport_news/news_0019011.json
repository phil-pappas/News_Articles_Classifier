We really hope our fans come out and support this game.\" \nAs the hectic week came to a close for both sides, a normally harsh gameday atmosphere in Baton Rouge turned into a welcoming party for Gamecock fans making the trek to Louisiana. \n\"These guys here brought us in, we were just walking by and they invited us into their tailgate,\" said one South Carolina fan traveling with his two sons. \"Everyone has been welcoming us and saying 'glad you guys could make it.'\" Following the decision to move the LSU-South Carolina football game from Columbia to Baton Rouge due to devastating flooding in the state, a \"Geaux Gamecocks\" billboard was put up in Baton Rouge to welcome South Carolina fans making the trip to Louisiana for the game. Johnny Lombardi \nCarolina fans were greeted by billboards, free food and drinks, handshakes and love from LSU fans who understand all too well the pain they are going through back home. \n\"We feel their pain, and we just want to welcome them with open arms,\" said an LSU fan wearing a Gamecock shirt before the game. \n\"Two o'clock last night we were driving into town and we saw the billboard,\" said a South Carolina fan who drove through the night to get to Baton Rouge in time for the game. \"Man, it put tears in my eyes... It was great.\" \nSaturday showed the true spirit of southern hospitality and SEC solidarity. Even though the Tigers won the game 45-24, for just one day in Tiger Stadium we were all Gamecocks. Gamecock fans inside Death Valley show their thankfulness for Tiger fans' hospitality with a \"Thank You LSU\" sign.
