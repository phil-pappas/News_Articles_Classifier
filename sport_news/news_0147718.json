Sturgis is likely headed back to the street after missing a 33-yard field goal and an extra point. Kelly opted for a young unproven kicker over a few veterans and was burned. Bennie Logan \nHe was a one-man run-tackling machine for most of the game. When Brandon Bair left, Logan moved from nose tackle to defensive end and was still disruptive. Eagles offensive line \nIs it at all possible to pick up a first down on the ground late in the fourth quarter when nursing a lead? For the Eagles' finesse line, it's seems out of reach. Sam Bradford \nHe had another shaky first half, but Bradford had some impressive deep throws after the break. He completed 10 of 18 pass attempts for 195 yards and three touchdowns in the second half. As for his lack of mobility, it's part of the package. Jordan Matthews \nHe needs to come up with that catch on third down in the fourth quarter. Redskins safety Kyshoen Jarrett made a nice play on the ball, but good receivers make tough catches in big spots. Look at Pierre Garcon for evidence. Nolan Carroll \nHis two holding calls on the Redskins' game-winning drive were killers. One resulted in an automatic first down and the other offset a Redskins holding penalty. Darren Sproles \nHe gave the Eagles a jolt, as he often does, with a 42-yard punt return. And the Eagles, naturally, squandered good field position with a touchdown-nullifying penalty, a sack, and a wide left chip shot. Eagles pass rush \nKirk Cousins was getting the ball out quick, but one sack in 47 pass attempts isn't getting the job done. The Eagles have just three sacks in four games. Riley Cooper \nBradford hit him for a 62-yard touchdown on a deep post and the Eagles had their first points of the game. Cooper didn't catch another pass the rest of the way, however, and one shining moment doesn't offset many moments of nothingness. NFC East \nThe Eagles sit alone in the basement of the division, but the mediocre-to-subpar NFC East is still wide open. To quote noted football philosopher Bob Dylan, \"It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.\" \n- Jeff McLane", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:32:59.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
