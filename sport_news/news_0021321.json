I hope that the mindset of these young men will change in regards to expecting to be successful, and when they experience success follow it with greater focus and execution.” \nThe Lobos have been working hard all season, confident that they would end their losing streak. Now that they’ve done that, Starkey felt his team finally could focus on the next game instead of the dark cloud that seemed to constantly hang over them. \nA weight has been lifted off the Lobos’ shoulders, but Starkey said there is more work to be done to finish the season. \n“When you’re chopping down a big tree, all you can do is keep chopping wood,” he said. “That’s all we’ve done and eventually that tree fell, and now we have to make some lumber out of it. We have to come out next week and get ready to get the sawmill going and get this next win.” \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
