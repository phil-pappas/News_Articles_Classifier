It must look out for and contain the spillover effects of the near-decade long easy flow of hot money, he said. His comments are significant as the Governor is slated to address the IMF meeting next month in Turkey. \"The IMF is supposed to look at easy money polices in a global sense, but it has been sitting on the sidelines, and even applauding these kinds of policies ever since they were initiated and hasn't really questioned the value of these kinds of policies,\" Rajan said.
