Not always just wins and losses, but the situation, the expectations. So I’m good where I am right now.”\nJulien then added this: “I’m not even thinking about that. The only time I have to is when you (media) guys ask me.”\nNice.\nNext question.\nBut what’s noteworthy here is the way Bruins president Cam Neely jumped into the fray. It was a blast from the good old days of the National Hockey League, when men were men and it wasn’t uncommon for the heroic (or villainous) “third man in” to come to the defense of an embattled teammate.\n“People have mentioned that Claude could be on the hot seat, and I think it’s unfair to say that,” Neely said. “Claude’s a very good coach in this league. Donnie (Sweeney) came to us with a plan of how he’d like to see the team play, he’s had many conversations with Claude about that, but a lot of things happen throughout the course of the year that’s not necessarily just on the coach.\n“I know why certain things are said at times,” he said, “but it’s really unfair to start the season where it’s out there that the coach could be on the hot seat. I think it’s unfair to Claude.”\nLet me explain why it’s not unfair to place Julien on this so-called “hot seat” that Neely’s talking about: When the Bruins fired general manager Peter Chiarelli last spring, they chose to be vague about their coach’s future with the organ-eye-zation.\nSpeaking that day about who might emerge as the next general manager, Bruins CEO Charlie Jacobs essentially said it would be the new guy’s job to go thumbs-up or thumbs-down on Julien.\n“In all candor, in order to find the best candidate, you have to give him the freedom to make those decisions on their own,” Jacobs said. “They have to arrive at their own conclusions without prejudice from management.”\nAnd Neely, remember, disclosed that day that management spoke with Julien about possibly missing out on other coaching vacancies as he awaited his fate with the Bruins.\nAccording to Neely, Julien said he wanted to remain with the Bruins.\nFast forward to a little more than a month later — May 20 — when, to nobody’s surprise, Don Sweeney was named GM. While Sweeney said the requisite nice things about Julien — “I think tremendously of him as a coach and as a person” — he was vague about whether there would be a change behind the bench.\n“I have some things that I want to sit down with Claude and go through in a very orderly fashion as to where I think things need to change and where we need to change as a group,” Sweeney said.\nIt would take another couple of weeks for the Bruins to announce Julien would be returning.\nAnd that, people, is why Julien is on the hot seat. Fair or unfair, right or wrong, the Bruins have a new general manager who wants to see a different style of play. And the man being asked to institute this different style of play is the holdover coach who’s been on the job since 2007.\nAfter yesterday’s press conference, Neely was asked to expand on his comment about the unfairness of placing Julien on the “hot seat.”\n“I get why there’s that perception,” he said. “But Don had to go through conversations he felt he needed to go through with Claude. But I think it’s unfair to start the season off where there’s already a conversation where he’s on the hot seat.\n“I believe if it wasn’t written, I don’t know if the fans would be saying anybody’s on the hot seat,” he said. “If it’s written enough, people start to believe it.”\nHere’s where Neely misses the point: It’s not a bad thing that Julien is on the hot seat.\nConsidering the way last season ended, everybody should be on the hot seat. Not only is it not a bad thing, it’s a good thing — especially if you’re serious about getting back to the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:30:17.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
