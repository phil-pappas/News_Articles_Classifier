No reason was given. Following a Freedom of Information Law request and exhaustive interviews, the Daily Messenger was able to uncover more of the back story. HONEOYE — Mark Storm arrived in Honeoye in 1983, thinking it would be a temporary stop in a long and productive career of coaching young athletes. He was correct in believing his coaching career would be long and productive. But considering he retired in 2012 as a physical education teacher at Honeoye Middle-High School, his thoughts about this blue-collar hamlet in the town of Richmond being a temporary stop changed somewhere along the way. Storm’s arrival from his role as a graduate assistant at The College at Brockport turned into a 29-year career of teaching physical education while doing what he believed he was put on earth to do: coach. Boys soccer, girls soccer, boys basketball, girls basketball, softball and baseball. He coached them all at various levels for the Bulldogs. But it was varsity girls basketball where Storm made his mark, coaching the team for 29 years and winning 405 games, three Section V championships and one Far West Regional. “I don’t just love to coach,” says Storm, whose 405 wins is the fifth-highest total for girls basketball in Section V. “I love to coach in Honeoye.” Storm’s success with the girls program was a big reason he was viewed in 2013 as the ideal person to take the job with the varsity boys basketball program. A well-publicized hazing incident at the school had ended the promising season early, and the Honeoye Central School District looked to Storm to turn the program and culture around. And even as the boys team struggled in its first year under Storm, there was a sense that progress was positive. A sense that better days were coming back to a once-proud program that has seven Section V championships to its credit. Maybe that’s why Storm’s sudden dismissal from the job was nothing short of a stunner. At an Aug. 5 Board of Education meeting, board member Nathan VanBortel motioned “to appoint Mark Storm as the varsity boys basketball coach … for the 2015-2016 school year,” according to board meeting minutes. What followed was a roll call that included two members voting yes and five members voting no. Voting yes: Van Bortel and Andrea Badger. Voting no: Jessica Green, Thomas Mann, Keith Stumbo, Patrick Freivald and Sandra Hubble. To this day, Storm says he has never received an explanation for his termination. “The biggest thing for me is for 29 years I coached girls basketball, and I was re-hired year after year,” Storm says. “All of a sudden, there’s a problem.” Page 2 of 5 - Anyone who coaches for nearly 30 years is going to encounter friction along the way. Storm acknowledges as much, saying he has dealt with parents over the years who may not have agreed with his coaching style or thought their child deserved more playing time. Even with those differences, Storm said a formal complaint was never filed against him in all of the years he coached the varsity girls. And while Storm said his personnel file remains clear of any formal wrongdoings, it’s clear that public sentiment changed. It changed quickly, too. Freivald, Mann, Stumbo and Green all voted yes for Storm’s appointment to coach the boys basketball team in 2014. But early in 2015, Honeoye Board of Education members and Superintendent David Bills started to hear from parents who were voicing concerns. Stumbo, president of the Honeoye board, declined to offer specifics as to the reasoning behind the board’s 2015 vote. But he did say the concerns were cumulative. “There’s no smoking gun here, no single issue,” Stumbo said in August. “It was a combination of events, and we thought maybe it was time for a new direction.” The questions surrounding his dismissal are many, but the biggest remains why. Why was Storm, a coach whose respect in the basketball world goes well beyond the borders of Honeoye, so suddenly removed? Why did opinions change so drastically? And why was Storm not provided with formal reasons for his dismissal? At the core Storm told The Daily Messenger that in June, he was contacted by Bills. Storm was told there were concerns coming from some parents of the boys basketball players and that an investigation would follow. According to a July 30 email obtained by The Daily Messenger through a state Freedom of Information Law request, board member Hubble received a message on behalf “of a group of parents to request a meeting between any and all board members to discuss concerns we have in regards to Coach Mark Storm … We started this process back in January 2015 and have expected to receive a positive outcome, but have not. Our concerns are legitimate and we are prepared to move forward.” A Jan. 30 email to then-Athletic Director Phil Huber and Superintendent Bills states experiences have “made playing for Coach Storm, going to practice, playing in games, and just playing these sports an unpleasant experience.” The author of the email’s name and email address were redacted by the Board of Education, along with the names and email addresses of all of the 25 emails provided through the FOIL request. The email writer further states that he or she “would like to have the opportunity, as taught by this district, to stand up against the mistreatment, bullying, negative environment, in making sure everyone is treated with dignity and respect.” Page 3 of 5 - Another undated letter addressed to Bills went much further in its criticism of the coach, stating that “Mark clearly has a drinking problem.” The letter claims that Storm on two occasions was “excessively drunk” with the entire team present at Storm’s home. It accused Storm of being “loud and obnoxious,” then “viciously arguing with other parents.” It concludes by saying that “a once respected coach and educator is now the drunk laughingstock of town.” Storm was made aware of these concerns by Bills, who then started the investigation, Storm said. Bills has declined to comment on the situation, writing in an August email to the Daily Messenger that personnel matters remain confidential. Not long before the Aug. 5 board meeting, though, Bills got in touch with Storm. “He said they were not correct and they were all proven wrong,” Storm said of the concerns and accusations. “He (Bills) said he was going to recommend me for the job. So I’m not sure where the board’s at.” As for the specific charge of alcohol abuse, Storm flat out rejected the accusation. He pointed to one of his assistant coaches, a retired New York state trooper who is trained to recognize situations such as this. Storm said no concerns were ever raised. Legally, the board is not required to explain voting results, Stumbo has said. Honeoye is not unlike many other districts that have their coaches appointed on a year-to-year basis. Storm said he understands the process, but his frustration is rooted in being let go with no formal explanation. “Why can’t they look me in the eye … call me into executive session and say this is why,” Storm said. “We think you did this or you did that. I feel like I got thrown out like a piece of trash.” At the Aug. 5 board meeting, more than 40 people were in attendance, and 11 people spoke in support of Storm. No one voiced opposition. “If you had been there, you’d have thought we were at my eulogy,” Storm said. Of the 25 emails the Honeoye Central School District made available to The Daily Messenger, only the three already mentioned expressed concern. The remaining 22, from former co-workers, former players, opposing coaches, area basketball referees and Section V officials, were written without reservation in support of Storm. In addition, an online petition calling for the reinstatement of Storm has garnered more than 700 signatures. The Daily Messenger contacted several Honeoye community members who identified themselves as being opposed to Storm in a coaching capacity. But all declined to speak on the record for this article. Most of the concerns they raised centered on Storm’s approach, accusing him of being a bully and intimidating. Page 4 of 5 - Storm’s style Storm describes his coaching style as direct and honest, holding student-athletes accountable to themselves and teammates. “If you’re early, you’re on time,” he said. “And if you’re on time, you’re late.” Storm doesn’t deny he raised his voice during practice or games. And yes, he did confront players with brutally honest opinions. But that’s the method of pushing young athletes to achieve potential, said Storm, who likens varsity sports to Regents classes in the academic setting. It’s the highest level of high school sports; therefore, expectations are high. “I’m an educator,” Storm said. “I used to tell all my players, give me four years and I’ll give you a lifetime.” It’s an approach that Storm used for 29 seasons of varsity girls basketball — and in terms of wins and losses, the most visible gauge of success in sports, it worked. But even more important to Storm, his lessons extended beyond high school. According to those opposed to Storm, however, his style was offensive and outdated. It went beyond benching players and into affecting confidence and psyche. “I think to some degree, that (style of coaching) has changed,” Stumbo said. “I think he’s a little behind the times.” That said, there has been no shortage of support for Storm as evidenced by comments on various social media sites and letters to the Board of Education. “I am very happy that Coach Storm has not only mentored but has also held his players accountable, which is something that is lost these days by coaches, teachers, school administrators and parents,” reads a June 8 email to board member Green. “Speak with the athletes who ‘hated’ his guts while he was coaching them and then came back as adults to thank him just as many sons and daughters fight with their parents over ‘things’ not being fair and then later thank them when they become parents themselves,” states a June 8 email to Bills. “Mr. Storm was my JV soccer coach. He was firm and taught us to be disciplined and respectful. This has carried on with me in my life as an adult, it taught me respect, discipline and hard work pay off,” states a June 10 email to Bills. Throughout his career at Honeoye, Storm’s girls basketball teams have won Section V Sportsmanship Awards nine times. The boys basketball team was named the 2013 Sportsmanship Award winner, and two of his baseball teams have won the award. Opponents of Storm have pointed to rosters for boys basketball and baseball, citing a lack of upperclassmen (each team had just two seniors) because some Honeoye students did not want to play for Storm. But supporters point out that disciplinary problems and work ethic are part of the issue as well and that at least one student who elected to not play basketball last winter was dismissed from a team this fall. Page 5 of 5 - What’s next Storm learned this past week that his coaching career at Honeoye is in all likelihood finished. He has been the varsity baseball coach for 12 years, but his recommendation for the job in 2016 from current Athletic Director Jeff Orman was refused by the Board of Education at the Oct. 7 meeting. Further, Honeoye has hired a new boys basketball coach. Trevor Gage, a 2000 graduate of Avon High, will take over the program after being the junior varsity boys coach at Eastridge over the last five seasons. Storm has been seeking legal counsel for options, and he said late this week that it’s still too early to say what might happen, if anything. When asked if there is any appeal process for Storm, Stumbo said there’s nothing to appeal. “Coaches are hired on a year-to-year basis,” Stumbo said. “It’s not like teachers where they get tenure.” It’s a process that has supporters of Storm frustrated. “There has been no due process in this situation, and clearly many members of the Board of Education heard a few angry parents over the vast majority of the very people they are supposed to be representing,” Andi Kaufmann, a 1999 Honeoye graduate and five-year varsity basketball player for Storm, wrote in an e-mail to The Daily Messenger. “His tenure over the last four decades should be celebrated, not diminished by a few angry parents who can’t see the bigger picture.” Storm was eager to continue coaching basketball and baseball at Honeoye because his son was coming through the program, he said. But at some point in this ordeal, it became about more than himself. “I love to coach … and we have some great kids in the program,” Storm said. “But it’s not for me anymore — it’s for other coaches. It’s about some people who can just come in and say what they want without impunity … Some people get blinders on when it comes to their kids or grandkids.” For his part, Stumbo understands it’s a touchy issue, but he said he’s confident the school board made the correct decision. “There are people who feel strongly both ways,” he said. What is known is that Honeoye will be without a coach it’s had on various sidelines and benches for nearly three decades. For many, that’s a loss that will be difficult to overcome. “I have been involved with varsity baseball for the last 13 seasons,” states a separate letter to Bills. “... I have watched the kids respond to changes in both physical and mental capabilities caused when moving up to a higher level of competition. In almost every case, the kids handle it better than the parents do.” Gates-Chili Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:06:32.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
