In fact, it wasn't what most people would define as contested in any traditional sense, but Miami Carol City's 33-0 win over Miami Southwest still featured a handful of high-level prospects. Below are some takeaways from Thursday night's contest. I was impressed with... Class-of-2019 running back Nayquan Wright did some nice things. It wasn't his biggest game, but it was still clear that the Carol City freshman has a bright future in front of him. He holds a handful of major offers as is, and his rare combination of size and quickness is always on display. Just a freshman, Wright already represents a talented Carol City squad as one of the team's captains. Four-star wide receiver Kevaughn Dingle wasn't dominant by any stretch. He dropped a pair of catchable passes but also grabbed a touchdown and showed some impressive shiftiness. Dingle is known for his size and physicality, but he also has some elusiveness that sometimes goes overlooked. His battle is with consistency. 2017 four-star WR Kevaughn Dingle with an easy TD grab. 14-0 Carol City leads SW. https://t.co/sYB60lPIuO - Rob Cassidy (@Cassidy_Rob) October 8, 2015 I was surprised by... Montray Smith 's 6-foot-3 frame grabs attention, sure. Big wide receivers are always in demand. That said, Smith showed he is skilled at using his length on Thursday night. The three-star prospect scored a pair of early touchdowns on jump balls tossed to the end zone by Carol City's backup quarterback, who started the game due to an injury to the team's starter. Smith only carries a handful of offers to this point, and it's sort of surprising that his list of options isn't longer. Carol City linebacker De'Andre Wilder , who plays both linebacker and defensive end, has a great build and impressive quickness off the edge. The raw physical tools are there in spades, giving Wilder tremendous upside. He will need to develop as a football player, however. As Wilder becomes more versatile with his pass rush moves and learns to stay assignment sound, he could become a truly elite prospect. His quickness, strength and long arms have the attention of a number of major college programs for good reason. Other notes... Florida commit Christopher McWilliams played both wide receiver and defensive back for Miami Southwest and came up with an interception late in the fourth quarter of the blowout. McWilliams is a bit undersized and his team was totally overmatched, but the fact that he was able to impact the game anyway says something about his football prowess. Carol City quarterback Stephen Calvert missed Thursday's game with a shoulder injury. Calvert, who is currently committed to Liberty, says he expects to return from injury for next Friday's game against Miami Norland. Montray Smith says Florida State recently reached out and began the recruiting process, but no offer has materialized as of now. According to Smith, Cincinnati , Toledo and Western Kentucky lead for his commitment, but that could change if more offers arrive between now and the end of his senior season. Miami leads the recruitment of Kevaughn Dingle , who says that schools such as Cincinnati and Tennessee are chasing the Hurricanes for his commitment. Just a junior, Dingle does not intend to make a verbal commitment until his senior season. \nRob Cassidy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:22:12.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
