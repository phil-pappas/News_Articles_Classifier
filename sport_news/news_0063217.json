That was not a slide and that is not how u 'go in hard'! â€” Chipper Jones (@RealCJ10) October 11, 2015 \nThe former Atlanta Braves third baseman also retweeted this: MLB ruling; You're allowed to break Ruben Tejada's leg but not Buster Posey's. \nPLUS: How will the Mets replace Tejada? \nUtley's late slide broke Tejada's right fibula. The Mets shortstop won't play again this season. \nThe play helped the Dodgers tie Saturday's game at 2-all before they won, 5-2, to even the National League Division Series at 1-1. \nBrendan Kuty may be reached at bkuty@njadvancemedia.com .
