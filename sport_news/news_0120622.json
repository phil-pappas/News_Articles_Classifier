A judge is hearing arguments from the Washington Redskins on June 23, 2015, that canceling the team's trademarks would infringe its free-speech rights. The hearing is scheduled on a lawsuit to overturn a decision by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to cancel the trademark on the grounds that it may be offensive to Native Americans. (AP Photo/Nick Wass, File) \nWASHINGTON — Republican presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Jeb Bush have weighed in on the Washington Redskins’ name controversy, saying the team shouldn’t change the name. \n“I don’t find it offensive,” Bush told SiriusXM’s “The Arena.” “Native American tribes generally don’t find it offensive.” \nSides are split on a Redskins’ name change. Proponents say the nickname is a symbol of pride for fans who align with the squad’s hard-nose playing style and lineage of NFL Hall of Fame players. \nOpponents say the term “redskin” is a racial slur toward Native Americans. Some have protested the team before games; others have said outright that the Redskins should consider a name change. \nIn July, a federal judge ordered the cancellation of the team’s federal trademark registrations, marking a victory for Native American activists. \nDuring his SiriusXM interview, Bush recalled a similar incident in Florida during his time as mayor. Controversy surrounded the name of Florida State University’s football team — the Seminoles — until the Seminole Tribe of Florida and Seminole Nation of Oklahoma endorsed the nickname. \n“It’s a sport for crying out loud,” Bush exclaimed about the Redskins’ issues. “It’s a football team. Washington has a huge fan base. I’m missing something, I guess.” \nIn a separate interview with the New York Times, Trump agreed with Bush. \n“Honestly, I don’t think they should change the name, unless the owner wanted to,” he said. \nTrump told the Times that the issue is another example of unnecessary political correctness. \n“I know Indians that are extremely proud of that name,” Trump said. “They think it’s positive.” \nOn Sunday, the Redskins beat the Philadelphia Eagles, 23-20, at FedEx Field in Landover. \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP.
