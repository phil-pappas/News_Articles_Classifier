Whether he'll do much more — or any more — Thursday night at Houston is still unclear. \nLuck did not speak with reporters after Sunday's 16-13 overtime victory, which he sat out because of an injured right shoulder, or before practice Monday. He is expected to take questions Tuesday. \nMatt Hasselbeck replaced Luck on Sunday, was 30 of 47 with 282 yards and one touchdown, and would likely start again Thursday if Luck can't play. \nIndy (2-2) also released third-string quarterback Josh Johnson on Monday and re-signed cornerback Shaun Prater to the active roster. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:51:03.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
