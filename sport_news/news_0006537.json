The gutsy scorer never shied away from burying opponents by nailing big shots. As St. Michael coach Apache Paschall said, \"She's fearless.\"\nFor her consistency in the clutch, O'Neill is the Daily News Player of the Year.\nO'Neill's ability to rise to the occasion was unequaled. When St. Michael's faced St. Peter's for the CHSAA state ‘AA' title, she poured in 22 points, keying a 66-43 rout. When the Eagles battled Copiague in the state Federation Class AA semis, she drained four free throws in the final 1:01, lifting her squad to a 50-46 win.\nO'Neill saved her best for last, scoring 13 points — and earning tournament MVP honors — as the Eagles upended defending champ Bergtraum, 62-58, in the state Federation title game.\nBehind O'Neill's shooting, the team hoisted its first-ever state Federation title — and Paschall wasn't shy about heaping praise on his standout guard.\n\"She's definitely a big-time player who's not afraid to take the big shot,\" Paschall said.\nDurand Scott , Rice\nWhen the season began, the spotlight wasn't focused on Scott, but by winter's end, the Miami -bound swingman had helped Rice to the state Federation Class AA title and the CHSAA Intersectional crown while making a name for himself.\nThere was the mid-January performance against Pine Crest ( Fla. ) and touted junior Brandon Knight , when Scott scored 26 while harassing Knight into 1-of-15 shooting in the first half. And there was his defense against Lincoln in the Federation semifinals, when he held McDonald's All-American Lance Stephenson to 12 points as Rice dismantled the Railsplitters, 77-50.\nAdd all that to his heroics in the Federation title game, when he practically willed the team to victory after slow start, and it's no wonder Rice coach Maurice Hicks said Scott, the Daily News Player of the Year, is just as good as former Rice greats Kemba Walker (now at UConn ) and Edgar Sosa ( Louisville ).\n\"He's right up there with the rest of them,\" Hicks said. \"He has a unique style . . . but he gets the job done.\"\nCOACH OF THE YEAR\nBoys\nApache Paschall, St. Michael Academy The St. Michael Academy Eagles played the entire season as if they had a giant chip on their shoulder, and that's exactly how coach Apache Paschall liked things.\nPaschall, the Daily News Coach of the Year, dangled the perfect carrots in front of his players all winter, coaxing the team to its first state title.\nBefore the Eagles faced rival Christ the King in the first round of the CHSAA ‘AA' state tournament, Paschall reminded his players that they'd often been considered \"second-class citizens\" compared to the Royals. The Eagles responded by rolling past CK en route to their first CHSAA state crown.\nTwo weeks later, Paschall pulled out more motivational ammunition to prepare St. Mike's for its state Federation Class AA final, highlighting the lengthy championship history of opponent Bergtraum.\n\"We're playing against a uniform,\" he said.\nSt. Michael Academy edged the Lady Blazers, 62-58, for the state title. It finished 25-3, ranked No. 5 in ESPN 's final girls basketball poll.\n\"We finally got the monkey off our backs,\" Paschall said afterwards. \"What are people going to say now?\"\nGirls\nMaurice Hicks, Rice Senior leader Durand Scott sat out the first two weeks of the season with an ankle injury, and Rice's youthful supporting cast didn't exactly intimidate the rest of the CHSAA.\nEven Scott says he doubted that Rice had the makeup of a champion before the season.\nWhen the Raiders struggled in the early going, losing by 20 to nationally-ranked Findlay Prep, Maurice Hicks, the Daily News Coach of the Year, used the blowout as fuel.\nImmediately after the Findlay loss, he told his team it needed a reality check if it planned to emerge as a contender.\n\"That was one of the top teams in the country,\" Hicks told his players afterward. \"If you want to be a top team, you see that we need a lot of work.\"\nRice reeled off eight straight wins, and never looked back.\nHicks gradually fused the senior leadership of Scott and forward James Stukes with the talent of sophomores Jermaine Sanders and Kadeem Jack, leading Rice to the ‘AA' Intersectional and state Federation titles and becoming the first coach in CHSAA history to claim six city crowns.\nEven in victory, he credited the players that he'd prodded to the title.\n\"Every day, they came in the gym and were prepared to work,\" he said. \"Through that, what resulted is a state championship.\" Related News Daily News' All-Bronx boys and girls high school basketball teams Daily News' All-Brooklyn boys and girls high school basketball teams Daily News' All-Manhattan boys and girls high school basketball teams Daily News' All-Queens boys and girls high school basketball teams Daily News' All-Staten Island boys and girls high school basketball teams", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:40:19.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
