However, he did not acknowledge his connection to the church or that he has written for the church's magazine, Freedom.\nOne producer who was contacted told THR , \"He definitely had an agenda.\"\n>> Read more trending stories\n\"Going Clear\" has been a global phenomenon since its March release, gaining a screening of the film in the U.K. and a re-release in theaters . (Video via HBO / \"Going Clear\" )\nEach attempt to release the film has met backlash from the church. Most recently, two theaters near the Scientology world headquarters in Florida were reportedly pressured by church members against screening the film. (Video via Scientology )\nGibney explains the reasoning behind the church's strong reactions, though: \"There is a doctrine expounded by L. Ron Hubbard called Fair Game and the idea is if the church is criticized, it's done by someone who is clearly not right in their head ... so it's fair game to go after them with everything you've got.\"\nOn another occasion, a Florida Q&A resulted in a \"screaming match\" between two former high-level Scientologists who appear in the film and two current members of the church.\nA spokesperson also released a public letter to Gibney, re-iterating the \"axes to grind\" the subjects of the film had — and requested a subtitle be added to the film saying, \"See freedommag.org for all the lies I am telling in this film.\"\nThose lies, the spokesperson alleges , are a result of Gibney not asking the church to comment on the stories included in the doc. To counter that, Gibney told Business Insider he reached out to the church, John Travolta and Tom Cruise, all of whom declined to give comments.\nIf \"Going Clear\" wins the Oscar for Best Documentary, it could potentially shine a massive spotlight on the church, one that it does not want.\nAnd whether these reported incidents have any influence over the 221 voting members in the Academy's documentary branch stands to be seen. Gibney has been nominated for an Oscar twice and won in 2008 for his doc \" Taxi to the Dark Side ,\" which looks into America's torture practices in the Middle East.\nOne thing is for sure, though: The attempts to dissuade the Academy from giving the Oscar to Gibney are the same reasons people have developed such an interest in the religion, so the church's efforts may still help Gibney more than hurt him.
