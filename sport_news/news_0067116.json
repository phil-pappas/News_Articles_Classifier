St. George finished the 5K race in 17:27. \nSophomore Alex Urbahn was not far behind, crossing the finish line in 17:37 to take 24th place overall. \nWickham Park, known for its many hills and up-and-down sections of the course, will be the site of the CIAC class meets on Saturday, October 31, and the State Open on November 6. The Invitational helped those Rams who have state tournament experience get reacquainted with the course, and gave the newer runners a first look at the layout. \nFollowing St. George and Urbahn was senior Aidan Buck, who clocked in at 18:26 and took 57th place. \nSophomore Henry Asker finished 97th in 18:56, and senior Ryan McGough finished 115th in 19:08 to round out New Canaan’s scoring. \nJunior Jake Grigsby was 130th in 19:17, and senior Patrick Blasco was 210th in 19:55. \nThe unseeded varsity race featured 486 runners representing 70 schools. \nThe Rams scored 284 points to finish third in the team standings, with Shepaug Valley first (148), Barlow second (263), East Catholic fourth (315), and Rocky Hill fifth (348). \nIn the junior varsity race, New Canaan scored 94 points to finish fourth behind Amity (50), Hall (68), and Nashua North, N.H., (89), with Middletown (175) in fifth place. \nJunior Fausto Cortina led the Rams with a sixth-place finish in 18:51. He was followed by junior Jack O’Connor in 16th in 19:08, sophomore Alex Orwicz in 17th in 19:08, and senior Chris Roman in 18th in 19:18. \nJunior Tim Russo finished New Canaan’s scoring by taking 39th place in 19:50, with sophomores Noah Levine 43rd (19:53) and Dylan Wietfeldt 50th (20:01). \nThe Rams will host their final regular-season meet on Tuesday at 4 p.m. in Waveny Park, which will be the site of the FCIAC championship on Wednesday, Oct. 21.
