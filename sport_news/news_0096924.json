Warriors quarterback Brandon Bea has thrown for 407 yards and five touchdowns in the team's previous two wins over Warren County and Siegel, but first-place Oakland's defense has been absolutely dominant in recent weeks. In their last four games, the second-ranked Patriots have given up a combined 20 points, forced nine turnovers and recorded eights sacks while also blocking three punts and a pair of field goals. Riverdale owns a 32-13 all-time advantage in the \"Battle of the Boro,\" which dates back to 1974, but Oakland has won the last two by a combined 56 points. Murph's pick: Oakland 34, Riverdale 21 Friday, 7 p.m. COOKEVILLE (6-1, 3-1 2-6A) AT SMYRNA (5-2, 3-1) Cookeville, which moved up two spots to No. 8 in this week's Class 6A poll, is averaging 368.4 rushing yards per game this season. Running back Vic Johnson has piled up 1,411 yards and 17 scores on the ground this season, while Ole Miss commitment Gabe Angel has accounted for 527 total yards and nine touchdowns. Smyrna, which has suffered a pair of 14-point setbacks to ranked opponents Independence and Blackman, managed just 216 yards in last week's 28-14 loss to the Blaze. Running back Casey Perkins (809 total yards, 14 TDs) leads a balanced Bulldogs offense, which is averaging 27 points per contest, while quarterback John Turner (1,093 yards passing, 5 total TDs) has also been solid this season. Murph's pick: Smyrna 35, Cookeville 28 Friday, 7 p.m. PEARL-COHN (3-4, 3-0 5-4A) AT WHITE HOUSE (4-3, 1-2) After eight weeks, Pearl-Cohn is still struggling to get back to .500, but in order to accomplish that, the team will have to string together consecutive wins for the first time all season. The Jimmy Ferrell-led Firebirds have suffered losses to Hillsboro, MBA, CPA and Muscle Shoals (Ala.), but they're unbeaten in 5-4A and have averaged over 45 points in wins over region foes Macon County, Portland and Maplewood. White House, looking to extend its winning streak to three games, recorded three interceptions and forced a turnover on downs in last week's 30-15 win over Macon County. The Firebirds crushed the Blue Devils 79-36 in last season's Class 4A quarterfinal. Murph's pick: Pearl Cohn 42, White House 24 Friday, 7 p.m. FRA (8-0, 1-0 DII-A E/M D2) AT DAVIDSON ACADEMY (6-1, 1-0) A pair of standout quarterbacks will be squaring off in this Division II-A East/Middle Region District 2 battle of unbeatens as FRA's Spence Jones squares off against Davidson Academy's Kyle Gilbert. Jones, who has thrown for 747 yards and 12 scores while racking up 222 yards rushing and four touchdowns, accounted for 183 yards and a pair of touchdowns in last week's 34-14 win over Lipscomb - perhaps the Panthers' most impressive win to date. Gilbert, who has thrown for 1,198 yards and 12 touchdowns with just two interception, has helped guide the Bears to six straight wins, including a surprising 17-7 triumph over previously unbeaten BGA. Murph's pick: FRA 28, Davidson Academy 24 Friday, 7 p.m. TROUSDALE CO. (5-2, 4-1 5-1A) AT MTCS (6-2, 4-2) A crowded Region 5-1A has come down to five teams vying for four postseason spots, and each remaining game is crucial for both Trousdale County and Middle Tennessee Christian. The Yellow Jackets dropped consecutive early-season contests to Upperman and second-place Jo Byrns, but have since to reeled off lopsided wins over Gordonsville, Monterey and Pickett County. MTCS, currently fifth in the standings, has strung together four straight victories, including last week's 33-20 win over Cannon County in which senior running back Tanner Green tallied 252 yards rushing and three touchdowns. Murph's pick: Trousdale County 34, MTCS 27 Friday, 7 p.m. DCA (5-2, 2-0 DII-A E/M D1) AT FRIENDSHIP CHRISTIAN (4-3, 2-1) DCA running back Shannon Fayne ran for 148 yards and a pair of touchdowns in his team's 20-17 Week 7 win over defending Division II-A champion Webb School of Knoxville, and the 5-foot-11, 185-pound senior is closing in on the 1,000-yard for the season. Friendship Christian, led by dual-threat quarterback Mike Jones, have strung together consecutive wins - 49-7 over Mt. Juliet Christian and 25-20 over Clarksville Northwest - since suffering a 28-point setback to FRA on Sept. 25. Murph's pick: DCA 21, Friendship Christian 14 Friday, 7 p.m. BRENTWOOD ACAD. (6-1, 4-0 DII-AA E/M) AT FATHER RYAN (4-3, 1-2) week ago, throttling previously unbeaten Montgomery Bell Academy behind a monstrous performance from junior quarterback Jeremiah Oatsvall. Oatsvall finished with five total touchdowns and was responsible for 412 of the Eagles' 557 yards of total offense. This week's opponent, Father Ryan, shouldn't present the same kind of challenge, though, as the Irish have struggled against region competition, being outscored 98-37 in matchups with McCallie, Pope John Paul II and MBA. Murph's pick: Brentwood Acad. 42, Father Ryan 10 Friday, 7 p.m. STEWARTS CREEK (4-3, 2-2 5-5A) AT SHELBYVILLE (5-2, 2-2) These two team's postseasons could be on the line in this Region 5-5A showdown. After jumping out to a 5-0 start to the season, Shelbyville has since dropped consecutive region contests - a 34-7 loss to Lincoln County, followed by a 45-15 setback to Independence - and standout quarterback Mason Cunningham has tossed four interceptions in that stretch. Stewarts Creek, which is coming off a bye, also has a pair of region losses on the season, and whichever team scores a victory Friday will have a huge leg up in what has become a six-team race for four playoff spots. Murph's pick: Shelbyville 35, Stewarts Creek 24. Friday, 7 p.m. LIPSCOMB (5-2, 3-0 6-4A) AT HILLWOOD (3-4, 2-1) First-year Hillwood coach Kurt Page has already tripled the team's win total from the last two seasons, and on Friday against visiting Lipscomb Academy, the Hilltoppers have an opportunity to take over the top spot in Region 6-4A. The first-place Mustangs, ranked 10th in Class 4A, had their three-game winning streak ended last week after surrendering 24 unanswered points to Franklin Road Academy before ultimately suffering a 34-14 defeat to the Panthers. Murph's pick: Lipscomb 24, Hillwood 12 Friday, 7 p.m. WHITES CREEK (3-4, 1-2 5-3A) AT WH HERITAGE (4-3, 2-1) Whites Creek couldn't capture its second Region 5-3A victory of the season last week, suffering a 35-28 loss to visiting Greenbrier, but the Cobras, led by first-year coach Tyrus Ward, will have another chance this week when they travel to White House Heritage. The second-place Patriots, however, have rolled to four straight double-digit victories, including last week's 37-0 win over Westmoreland behind quarterback Austin Gunter's three-touchdown passing performance.
