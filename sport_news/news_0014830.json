They looked lifeless and outclassed against a team at the level they aspire to reach. But Saturday offered definitive proof that Miami will never get there under Golden—no matter how many excuses anyone makes.\nThe crowd was lame.\nDid you see that weather? Who could blame them for going to the beach instead of watching what the Hurricanes have put on the field the past few years? Miami plays seven games a year at Sun Life Stadium.
