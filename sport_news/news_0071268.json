Dixon ranks first among current NCAA players (4,593), while McGuire has 3,553. \nThis season Dixon has run for 524. McGuire has 331. \nIn last year’s win, Dixon ran for a 98-yard touchdown. \nDriskel transferred to Tech two years ago and this season he has already thrown for 1,171 yards. \nThe rivalry apparently has not been understated in either Ruston or Lafayette this week. \nUL head football coach Mark Hudspeth said he has been especially mindful of Saturday’s game. Hudspeth said after last year’s loss his players have been more than cognizant of the importance of the contest. \n“They heard from me about this game after we lost to (Tech) last year. Then they heard about it all spring and summer. Our players remember how they felt after (last year’s game) was over. \n“Tech came in here last year with a chip on their shoulder and we will go up there this weekend with one on our shoulders,” Hudspeth said this week. \nTech head football coach Skip Holtz said the atmosphere surrounding the UL game is different. \n“This is a game that everyone looks forward to from a fan base standpoint, from a coach’s standpoint and from a player’s standpoint,” Holtz said during his weekly press conference. \n“It builds an immediate rivalry geographically. I know everyone wants bragging rights and it creates a lot of excitement and energy,” he said. \nHudspeth said much of made of a perceived recruiting advantage for the winning team, but he said that’s not always the case. \n“This is the type of game that is more for the fans and the bragging rights. Recruiting is year to year. This is a type of game that brings out our fans, former players and pride for your university. Your players want to play awafully hard,” Hudspeth said. \nWhile Driskel is set to play quarterback, the Cajuns are still unsettled at the position. \nHduspeth said he is re-examining the Cajuns’ quarterback situation and will choose between three-game starter Brooks Haack and Jalen Nixon. \nHoltz said he is worried about the UL rushing game, which is ranked No. 19 in the FBS. \nEspecially effective is McGuire, said Holtz. \n“I really like Elijah McGuire. I think he is pretty electric with the ball under his arm,” said Holtz. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/sports/college/ul/2015/10/01/ul-face-la-tech-intriguing-matchup/73147912/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:19:15.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
