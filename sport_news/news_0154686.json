Houston leads the race for the second AL wild-card spot. \nNew York had failed to reach the playoffs in consecutive years for the first time since its 1982-93 drought, just before the start of a golden age that included five World Series titles and seven AL pennants from 1996-2009 for the now-retired Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. \nThe Texas Rangers also clinched a wild-card spot and moved to the cusp of the AL West title, with Adrian Beltre's three-run double backing pitcher Derek Holland in a 5-3 win over the Los Angeles Angels. \nThe Rangers (87-72), in the playoffs for the first time since 2012 after a 95-loss season, are a win or a Houston loss away from their first division title since winning two straight and going to the World Series in 2010-11. \nThe Angels are a game behind the Astros and tied with Minnesota for the second wild-card slot. \nThe AL East champion Toronto Blue Jays rested their regulars a day after clinching the division title as Manny Machado homered twice in the Baltimore Orioles' 6-4 win. \nThe game was delayed by rain for nearly 3 1/2 hours. \nMinnesota pinch-runner Eduardo Nunez scored from third base off a wild pitch and Torii Hunter hit a sacrifice fly in the ninth inning as the Twins beat the Cleveland Indians 4-2 and moved a little closer to an AL wild-card spot. \nFacing a crushing loss, the Twins scored a run in the eighth to tie it and then two unearned runs in the ninth off Cody Allen (2-5). They're tied with the Angels, one game behind Houston for the second wild-card berth with three games left. \nIn Philadelphia, Jerad Eickhoff struck out 10 batters in seven innings and Darin Ruf hit a two-run homer as the Phillies beat the National League East champion New York Mets 3-0 to complete a three-game sweep. \nThe Mets have a one-game lead over the Dodgers for home-field advantage in their division series next week. \nThe Chicago Cubs kept alive their slim hopes for home-field advantage in the NL wild-card game after Austin Jackson hit a three-run homer and Anthony Rizzo added an RBI double in a 5-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. \nThe Cubs moved within two games of idle Pittsburgh in the race for home field in Wednesday's NL wild-card playoff game. The Reds lost their 12th in a row. \nSan Francisco pitcher Brett Anderson gave up four hits in 7 2-3 innings as the NL West champion Los Angeles Dodgers wrapped up their road schedule with a 3-2 win over the San Francisco Giants. \nIn other games, Jonny Gomes drove in three runs as the Kansas City Royals beat the Chicago White Sox 6-4 to move into a tie with Toronto for the AL's best record, the Tampa Bay Rays downed the Miami Marlins 4-1 for a three-game sweep, the Washington Nationals blanked the Atlanta Braves 3-0, the San Diego Padres defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 3-1 and the Arizona Diamondbacks were 8-6 winners over the Colorado Rockies.
