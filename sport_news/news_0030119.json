They are looking to climb the ladder this year as the tournament starts today at Twin Hills Country Club in Joplin. \n“When you looked at the rosters last year for the top five teams, I think the most any of them were going to lose was one player,” Helias coach Dan Mathes said. “So I figured we’d be seeing the same group of teams back this year.” \nHelias, with four players returning and a fifth who attended the tournament last year, believes that experience will help this year. \n“In my years of coaching, I have seen that the girls going the second or third time do so much better than they do the first time,” Mathes said. “They don’t believe that was their best effort, I think some of them are looking to redeem themselves a little bit this year.” \nLauren Plunkett, one of four senior qualifiers for Helias, is making her third trip to state. She was 26th as a junior after finishing 53rd in the Class 2 state tournament in 2013. \n“We’re looking for her to be our leader down there and post a couple of solid scores,” Mathes said. “I don’t see why she won’t, she’s as level-headed a golfer as I’ve had in a long time.” \nMathes said Plunkett, who has received college scholarship offers in recent weeks, has been playing her best golf of the season. \n“That’s helped her relax and play better,” Mathes said. \nAshten Lorts, who tied for 54th as a junior, will hold down the No. 2 spot for the Lady Crusaders. \n“She’s probably been our biggest surprise,” Mathes said. “She’s really matured on the golf course and has been very consistent.” \nLuci Francka will be in No. 3 position after tying for 58th last year. \n“She’s been steady for most of the year, shooting in the low to mid 80s,” Mathes said. “And that’s what we need out of her for two days.” \nAlex Nelson is the only non-senior qualifier for Helias. The sophomore, who tied for 42nd at state last year, will hold down the No 4 position. \n“She reminds me a lot of this group of seniors when they were sophomores, just a little inconsistent,” Mathes said. “She hits the ball straighter than anybody on the team, it’s a matter of being more consistent around the greens.” \nMaggie Kehoe rounds out Helias’ qualifiers. She is making her first state tournament appearance. \n“If she can get off to a good start, that would be huge for her,” Mathes said. “In the tournaments in which she’s played well, it’s when she starts well.” \nHelias has not played at Twin Hills before. The Lady Crusaders were scheduled for an all-important practice round Sunday before the two-round tournament starts today. \nMathes said people have compared it to Meadow Lake Acres Country Club and Jefferson City Country Club. \n“It’s supposedly not very hilly like Meadow Lake, just some rolling hills,” Mathes said. “And the greens are supposedly similar to Jefferson City Country Club.” \nThe mental part of the game will be important to how Helias finishes. \n“It’s going to be a long two days of five-hour rounds,” Mathes said. “We need to stay in the moment, just remember that the next shot is the most important shot. Everything before that doesn’t matter. \n“We need to think through the golf course, pick our best option. We’ve talked about staying mentally tough and not giving up the round or even a stroke.” \nMICDS, which returns all five of its players, is the defending state champion. \n“On paper, MICDS is the favorite,” Mathes said. “But you don’t win it on paper.” \nJohn Burroughs was second last year, followed by Pembroke Hill. Smithville was fifth. \n“When you look at everybody else, we’re right there with them,” Mathes said. “All of our girls are capable of shooting in the 70s or low 80s. It’s a matter of getting everyone to do it on one day or two days. If that happens, you never know. \n“If we can get five girls to play good for two days in a row, I’ll be happy to see where we’re at.” \nThe top four team finishers receive trophies. The top 15 individuals earn all-state honors. \nIII \nFive area players will play as individuals in the Class 1 state tournament, including a pair of Russellville Lady Indians making return trips. \nMikala Jungmeyer and Madison Oliver will represent Russellville in the tournament. \nJungmeyer, a senior, finished in a tie for 15th last year after tying for 19th as a sophomore and taking seventh as a freshman. Oliver was 83rd in 2014. \nSophie Brant of California returns to the state tournament after finishing in a tie for 56th in 2014. \nBreanna Kempker of Eugene and Alexandra Morningstar of New Bloomfield also qualified for state. \nThe five advanced to state by virtue of their finishes in the sectional tournament. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:31:15.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
