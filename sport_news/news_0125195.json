So much for dealing with political realities in D.C. CNN cut to a commercial and then Cooper came back with the final query: What enemy are you most proud of. Clinton got the most laughs, reeling off a long list, ending with \"the Republicans.\"\nThe candidates are finishing their closing statements.\nQuick thoughts : Clinton had some strong lines and showed some fire. Sanders hit several of his applause lines and his supporters will certainly be happy.\nO'Malley probably had the strongest debate of the three lesser-knowns. He came across as progressive enough to satisfy most of Sanders' supporters and politically savvy enough to satisfy Clinton backers. But did he seem too much like a conventional politician? Webb had some sharp points; Chafee not so much.\n7:52 p.m.\nAt last they're starting to talk about the political reality in Washington. Sanders says his solution to breaking the gridlock is to mobilize millions of citizens to demand change. He's been saying for months this is Obama's big failure -- not mobilizing the voters who put him into office. In truth, the Obama team did try to mobile their supporters by creating Organizing for Action. But this is hard to pull off and Organizing for Action was never that influential.\n7:47 p.m.\nSanders says he'd probably vote to legalize marijuana. But Clinton says still have to see how legalization goes in states such as Oregon (which she doesn't mention by name). But she says pot users shouldn't go to jail.\n7:45 p.m.\nClinton gets good applause saying that California has proved that paid family leave programs work without hurting businesses. \"This is typical Republican scare tactics,\" she says. Then she's off on a big defense of Planned Parenthood.\nSanders is essentially left saying, I agree.\n7:41 p.m.\nOregon requires 25 percent of electricity to come from renewable energy by 2025 (and it doesn't include most hydro). O'Malley wants to go 100 percent \"clean\" electricity nationwide by 2050. Is he the greenest candidate in the presidential race?\nClinton defends her work on fighting climate change as secretary of state.\n7:37 p.m.\nClinton: \"I would not ask nobody to vote for me because of my last name.\"\nAnother line to remember.\n7:31 p.m.\nWebb gets off a pretty good dig at Sanders. \"I don't think the revolution is going to come and I don't think Congress is going to pay\" for a lot of this, he says. If there are any Democrats looking for a semi-conservative alternative, Webb might be making some headway.\n7:28 p.m.\n\"I think that's pretty obvious\" that she would be different than Obama, Clinton says, being the first woman president. But she can't say how that leads to any policy difference. It will be interesting to see how this plays with voters.\n7:24 p.m.\nClinton defends her vote for the Post 9/11 Patriot Act -- opposed by Sanders. She blames the Bush administration for \"chipping away\" at civil-liberty protections in bill. She's going to get fact-checked on this.\n7:18 p.m.\nThey are off on immigration reform. Basically, they are all for a path to citizenship. But here's what is striking: We're more than 90 minutes into this debate and there's been hardly a word said about how any of these Democrats are going to get anything done with a Republican Congress. Unless they think Democrats will retake the House in 2016 (very unlikely, the experts say) and get a 60-seat majority in the Senate (really unlikely), they can't just propose and have Congress do their will. Are we on Fantasy Island?\n7:12 p.m.\nQuestioner Dana Bash asks Clinton if Sanders is right when he calls for free public college tuition, higher Social Security and Medicare for all. Clinton carefully parses it, saying he would help people the most -- like low-income woman on Social Security.\n7:10 p.m.\nChafee says he had just appointed to fill his late father's seat in the Senate when he voted to repeal Glass-Steagall. \"That's a little tough\" to criticize him on that vote, he says. This might get him a little sympathy, but probably not any votes.\n7:06 p.m.\nClinton, with some exasperation says she has political guts.\n\"I'm not taking a backseat to anybody on my values and principles and the results I get,\" she says. She's doing some image rehab here.\n7:04 p.m.\nWho is tougher on the banks? That's the riff they're off on now. Clinton says she is, because she wants to take on \"shadow banking,\" which are big insurers and other financial firms that pose a danger to economy. Sanders says no, he wants to break up the big banks. O'Malley, by the way, started this off by saying Clinton should have reinstated the depresssion-era Glass-Steagall law limiting what kinds of businesses banks can get into.\n6:58 p.m.\nHey, Sanders says we're better off! Not his usual riff. To qualify it, though, he says we're better off than we were eight years ago when the economy was in free fall at the end of the Bush presidency.\n6:56 p.m.\nO'Malley gets another chance to talk about how as mayor of Baltimore, he told state legislators there needed to be more concern for young blacks dying in the streets. He needs to figure out how to assure people that it isn't his fault that racial tension is so high in Baltimore.\n6:50 p.m.\nClinton admits mistakes on emails, saying she released 55,000 of them. Doesn't mention the ones she deleted. Then she is into attacks on the House investigation, saying it was designed to drive down her poll numbers.\n\"The American people are sick and damned tired of hearing about your emails,\" Sanders butts in, saying the focus should be on more important things \"Enough of the emails. Let's talk about the real issues.\"\nBig applause. This might have been the line of the night, so far.\n6:41 p.m.\nSanders was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War because he was so strongly opposed, he says. But, he adds, \"I am prepared to take this country into war, if necessary.\"\nAny president would have to say this. But you don't often hear this kind of talk from Sanders.\n6:39 p.m.\nBenghazi comes up. \"There is always the potential for danger and risk,\" Clinton says of sending diplomats to danger spots. Overall, she defends how the Obama administration handled the military action that led to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan dictator.\nThere would certainly be a different tenor to this discussion if the Republicans were debating.\n6:34 p.m.\nClinton says she wants a no-fly zone considered in Syria to get some leverage over the Russians, who have just started military action there. Her experience as secretary of state is helpful here. Webb, a former top Pentagon official, also is forceful -- if nothing else arguing with Anderson Cooper to get more time.\nCooper pivots to Sanders, who seems to have a little trouble thinking on his feet here. Interesting exchange.\n6:27 p.m.\nLincoln Chafee gets a softball question why he has said she should be disqualified from presidency because of her vote in favor of Iraq War in 2002. Chafee kind of muffs it, noting that Sanders just called it the worst decision in American history.\nBut what does Chafee think?\n And Clinton has a prepared answer that is much crisper than Chafee's fumbling around. Barack Obama criticized her vote, she noted, when they ran against each other in 2008. And then he made her secretary of state.\n6:20 p.m.\nThe Oregon shooting comes up, with Sanders on the defensive. Clinton criticizes Sanders for voting for Brady background check bill back in early 90s. And she adds: \"It's time the entire country stood up against the NRA.\"\nO'Malley, who has made gun control a signature issue, talks about the restrictions he got passed in Maryland.\nSanders says attitudes are different in rural areas, and O'Malley accuses him of pandering. \"Our job is to bring people together around commonplace gun legislation,\" Sanders says.\nJim Webb chips in that he supports background checks, but he wants to respect peoples' rights to protect themselves.\nThis is the most heated the debate has been so far.\n6:12 p.m.\nClinton gets quizzed on whether she shifts political stances with an eye on the polls. \"I'm a progressive, but I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.\"\nThen it's Sanders' turn to get grilled by Anderson Cooper on how he can win calling himself a democratic socialist. \"We're going to explain what democratic socialism is,\" he says, talking about how it is wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent has almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Time to be more like Denmark and Sweden, he says.\nClinton chips in, saying that to her, capitalism means giving people the freedom to start businesses. And sometimes, she says, capitalism has to be saved from itself -- a reference to how government has stepped in at various times in American history to help sand off the rough edges of capitalism.\n6:01 p.m.\nFour smiling politicians and Bernie Sanders, warning of impending doom. He didn't introduce his wife or children. \"Most Americans understand our country faces an unprecedented series of crises,\" he says.\nTV is not the cool medium for him.\n5:50 p.m.\nWe're off with two-minute candidate introductions. There was some confusion about exactly when this debate was starting.\nINTRO\nWelcome to the season premiere of Democrats Debate. After two episodes of Red-Meat Republicans, we get to hear from the five main Democratic candidates, live on stage from the Wynn Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.\nI wonder, did the contenders have to thread their way through the slot machines to get to the debate?\nBut I digress. Tonight is a big deal, politically speaking. For the first time, the Democratic candidates get to talk to a critical mass of voters (although the betting is that the ratings won't be as high as they were for the Republicans).\nJoin me as I live-blog the debate and dissect the main story lines. Will Hillary Clinton reverse her slow slide in the polls and reassert her grip on the Democratic presidential contest?\nWill Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders add to his rabid fan base? Will any of the other debaters -- former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and Lincoln Chaffee, former Rhode Island governor and senator -- have a break-out moment?\nThe debate will begin at 6 p.m. Pacific time on CNN and will last two hours. You can also watch it on the Internet, on CNN.com.\nA primer for the first Democratic presidential debate Get familiar with the participants in tonight's debate not named Clinton or Sanders.\nA few predictions:\nAs front-runner, Clinton will be forced to explain a lot, from her private email account to whether she accomplished much as secretary of state. She'll also be looking to contrast herself ... from the Republicans rather than the Democrats on stage.\nThe moderators will ask Sanders multiple questions about his self-description as a democratic socialist, and why he didn't defend capitalism in a recent TV appearance.\nFor the most part, though, anyone who has been to a Bernie Sanders rally won't hear too much new from him. His consistency is one of his big selling points.\nO'Malley will be the staunchest supporter of gun control; we'll see if he goes beyond the policy prescriptions of the other candidates. Expect references to Roseburg.\nWebb and Chafee are both former Republicans who are almost invisible on the campaign trail. Webb's a natural contrarian -- he quit the Senate after one term -- so it will be interesting to see where he goes. Chafee, you can bet, will mention that he was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against going to war with Iraq.\nAnd that brings it back to Clinton, whose vote for the war in 2002 was one big reason that she lost the 2008 primary to Barack Obama.\nAnd my final prediction: Vice President Joe Biden won't make a dramatic last-minute appearance . Really. But at some point, someone on stage will say they wish he had showed up.\n-- Jeff Mapes\njmapes@oregonian.com\n503-221-8209\n@jeffmapes", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/256605-sanders-why-dont-you-ask-republicans-if-theyre", "http://www.nytimes.com/live/first-democratic-debate-cnn-election-2016/joe-biden"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:10:05.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
