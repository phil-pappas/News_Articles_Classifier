One defender dove from the right and missed. Five yards more, a whiff from the other side. Fifteen yards more, Likely's blockers cleared the inside lane, and finally, three defenders closed in.\nSo Likely did all he could, going Superman with his 5-foot-7, 175-pound frame. From the 4-yard-line. Tackled in midair, he stretched out with the ball, landing his midsection on the pylon, sealing the touchdown.\nSixty-seven stunning yards for the score, just four series after he had returned a punt 47 yards, leading Maryland's 50-21 victory Sept. 5.\nWith his 233 punt return yards that day, breaking the Big Ten record Iowa legend Nile Kinnick set in 1939, Likely's dominance was reinforced.\nHis biggest surprise? That Richmond punted to him eight times. All but one became at least a 15-yard return, including one after his magical touchdown.\n\"After a while I kind of figured they were going to stop,\" Likely said this week as the Terps prepared to host Michigan on Saturday. \"But it's football, and you never know what's going to happen.\"\nMichigan State saw Likely up close last year, allowing him 228 kickoff return yards, a Maryland school record.\nSo Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is not going to underrate him.\n\"He is one of the best college returners the game has ever seen,\" Harbaugh said Thursday on WXYT-FM (97.1). \"The units that Maryland has — the kickoff returns and punt return — they've got a chance to break records that were set in 1949. That's how good they are. ... What a challenge. It's extremely exciting for all our guys running down on punts and covering kickoffs to contain their kickoff-return unit and punt-return unit and one of the great players in college football, Will Likely.\"\nLikely leads the country with a 28.1-yard return average and two punt-return touchdowns. And he is averaging 21.7 yards per kickoff return.\nSo will Michigan kick the ball out of bounds to avoid him?\n\"If we have to,\" Harbaugh said on the show.\nLikely is from Belle Glade, Fla., 18 miles from Pahokee, which fed U-M a few key players under former coach Rich Rodriguez. The junior comes by his speed and shiftiness naturally. But there's a reason so many players from the area have such unique football skills.\nChasing rabbits.\nWith NFL players Kelvin Benjamin, Fred Taylor and Santonio Holmes making it famous, the secret is out but has not been replicated elsewhere.\nEvery year, before the sugarcane is harvested, the leaves are burned off over thousands of acres. With the stalks gone and only the \"muck\" left, the rabbits emerge with nowhere to go, their hiding place vanished.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nU-M vs. Maryland moving to noon because of hurricane\nSo the kids chase, learning angles and strategy, with their feet in virtual quicksand in \"Muck City.\"\n\"It's a lot of instincts,\" said Likely, who started chasing around middle school. \"It's a lot of reacting and not much thinking in terms of catching the rabbit. ... It helped me. When we started off, we weren't looking at it as something that (helped for football), and we kind of put everything together and said, 'Hey, this helps on lateral quickness and things like that.' \"\nIt was just for fun.\n\"Coming from there, there's not that many opportunities. Football is one of the main things,\" Likely said. \"We all grew up on football.\"\nLikely's explosion on the field, especially in the return game, has become innate. He doesn't know where he's going until he goes there.\n\"From the day we recruited Will, I was very, very impressed with him on film,\" Maryland coach Randy Edsall said. \"Plays hard all the time, and when you get a chance to sit down with him in the recruiting process and hear the kind of goals he has for himself ... (he) is very, very impressive. He brought that here.\"\nIf Michigan only had to see Likely on the returns, there wouldn't be such a fear.\nBut he's an elite cornerback, tied for the Big Ten lead in interceptions last season with six, and a first-team All-Big Ten selection.\nOn Tuesday, Edsall said he has no plans to use Likely on offense, even though it seems intriguing.\nFor now, it's defense and the return game.\n\"I definitely want to play corner,\" Likely said, noting that teams are far more reluctant to throw his way this season. \"But if there's an opportunity to get the ball in my hands (on returns) and I don't get an opportunity on defense, that's a bonus, too.\"\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
