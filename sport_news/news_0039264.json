We moved some people around, which gave us a little more mass and moved people a little better,\" Mark Johnston said. \"Good game plan and it worked.\" \nTravis knew he was going to get the bulk of the carries today as usual. \n\"I knew it was going to be a dogfight,\" Travis said. \"I didn't know what the outcome would be, but I knew I would be getting the ball a lot.\" \nEverybody on the Rosecrans sideline knew the game plan and so did everybody on the River View sideline, but the Black Bears inability to tackle and shed blocks did them in. \n\"They didn't do anything we didn't expect,\" River View coach Bob Forgave said. \"But our kids have a hard time handling the pressure when they are supposed to win a game.\" \n\"We didn't tackle, we weren't physical. It was the same reasons we couldn't move the ball, we couldn't block,\" he added. \nThe Black Bears totaled 124 yards of total offense and their best drive of the game came late in the second half. It looked as if River View would be able to put points on the board before the half time break, but a fumble ended that drive.

They recovered it and turned that turnover into a touchdown of their own with 40 seconds left on the clock. \n\"That touchdown really lifted everyone up,\" Travis Johnston said. \nThe Bishops led 7-0 at halftime, but they remembered giving up 49 points in the second half to Marietta last week Travis said. \n\"We knew we couldn't do that again and we had to get picked up,\" he added. \nThe Bishops picked it up putting 21 points on the scoreboard in the second half. River View on the other hand, continued to struggle moving the ball on the ground. \nQuarterbacks Caden Croft and Keith Stewart combined for 103 passing yards, but Forgave said they need to be able to run the ball more effectively. \nThe Black Bears will travel to Zanesville next week, as Rosecrans will travel to Meadowbrook.
