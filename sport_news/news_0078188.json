The close encounter with the object known as 2014 MU69 would occur in 2019. It orbits nearly 1 billion miles beyond Pluto.\nFlight controllers already have sent commands for the course change. In all, four maneuvers will be needed. Thursday's is the first.\nNew Horizons became Pluto's first visitor from planet Earth in July. The team plans to formally ask NASA next year to fund the mission extension for studying MU69. Scientists promise a better name before showtime.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/764f5fa51d969f2c830f6a706700c5b9.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/764f5fa51d969f2c830f6a706700c5b9.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:13:09.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
