Tech volleyball on the edge of matching past season total By Diego Gaytan 0 \nMarguerite Grubb, the setter for the Texas Tech's women's volleyball team, serves to TCU during the home game against TCU on Saturday morning at the United Supermarkets Arena. Texas Tech lost the sets to TCU 30-28, 25-23, and 25-16. \nA win against the Kansas State Wildcats can match Texas Tech volleyball’s total wins of 2014 as it faces Kansas State at 3 p.m. Saturday in the United Supermarkets Arena. \nBoth teams enter the Saturday afternoon matchup reeling from a three- set defeat to the Texas Longhorns. \nTech, versus the Longhorns, nearly extended the match into a four-set contest as it led the second-set 23-19 before dropping six consecutive points to Texas and losing the set. \nBefore losing to the Longhorns, Tech defeated the West Virginia Mountaineers in three sets for its second win in the Big 12 and first Big 12 road win. \nAfter a clean victory over West Virginia, Don Flora said the team needs to improve on its ability to put to rest the final points of a set to gain momentum versus its opponents. \n“We made a couple of funny errors in set one, had four service errors, but then got back on course in the second set and felt like we we’re right where we needed to be but didn’t finish,” Flora said. “That’s something we will learn from and reflected on.” \nAlthough the team lost to Texas, freshman middle blocker Katy Keenan said the changed the Longhorns game plan, something the team wants to replicate. \n“To go to Texas and really put some pressure on them and to make them rethink their game plan and adjust to us is exactly what we wanted,” Keenan said. “We did a lot of really good things against Texas.” \nFor the Red Raiders, the match versus Kansas State presents the team with an opportunity to reclaim the home court advantage missing in its last two home games. The Wildcats, on the road, tally up just one win in its four road contest, the same number of wins as the Red Raiders. \nFreshman outside hitter Sarah Redding, who recorded a season high 11 kills versus West Virginia and 10 kills versus Texas, said the team regained some of the energy it started the Big 12 with. \n“We started out, I feel like, strong, but we just kind of had a lull in the middle of the season,” Redding said. “Now we’re just picking back up and starting to work together as a team, I feel like we flow better as a team.” \nAlthough the Wildcats enter its Saturday match with a losing record, the team has pulled set-wins versus its Big 12 opponents, unlike the Red Raiders. Of its three road losses, only one came from three straight set-losses. \nWith an 11-8 overall record and a 3-4 conference record, Kansas State risks losing a spot in the conference standings in its match versus the Red Raiders as Tech sports a 13-8 overall record and a 2-5 conference record. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:08:44.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
