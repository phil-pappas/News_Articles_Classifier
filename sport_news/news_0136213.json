There’s a reason and Texas Tech showed why this past Saturday. \nExplosive plays (counted as 10 yard gains or more) play a big factor in which team wins games and in the Big 12 the number must be high. Based off of ISU’s 2014 games 20 seemed to be the magic number to assure victory. \nExplosive plays were at the heart of Texas Tech having a record day in terms of total yards. The Red Raiders moved the ball with ease (it’s the highest success rate ISU’s allowed all season) and moved it in big chunks. They had six touchdowns of at least 33 yards. \nThere is a lot of impressive offensive numbers from this game. Not all are from Texas Tech. A 7.0 rushing yard average would be cause for ISU celebration back in the preseason when the ground game was still a big question mark. \nThe biggest takeaway, at least from a numerical standpoint, is the importance of explosive plays. ISU had a decent number. But Texas Tech had a great one. \nThe Cyclones learned, not for the first time in recent years, that it’s extremely hard for them to win without limiting the big plays of the Air Raid offenses that populate the Big 12.
