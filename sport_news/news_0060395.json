The fundraiser is an excellent opportunity for people who have never shot a firearm before to experience what it is like to handle and shoot a firearm safely. People who have handled weapons before can use the event as an opportunity to share their love of firearms with family, friends, and co-workers.\nThe fundraiser will have three different areas where you can try different weapons: trap shooting, sniper shooting, and practical shooting with an AR-15 type weapon. If you have your own trap shooting gun or your own AR-15 type weapon, feel free to bring it with you.\nNo experience is necessary.
