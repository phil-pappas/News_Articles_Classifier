IndiaToday.in | New Delhi, October 23, 2015 | UPDATED 22:11 IST Mail The Indian shuttler tried to stay alive in the second game after conceding an early lead. (Reuters Photo) \nWorld No. 2 shuttler Saina Nehwal was knocked out of of the USD 275,000 French Super Series when she lost the quarterfinal clash against eighth seed Ratchanok Intanon 9-21, 12-21. \nSaina looked out of form and put up a lackluster show in the first game against the Thailand shuttler, who went on thrash her opponent 9-21. The Indian shuttler tried to stay alive in the second game after conceding an early lead. But Intanon kept putting pressure on Saina and clinched the second game 21-15 and made her way to the semifinals of the tournament. Saina's exit means there are no Indian shuttlers left at the tournament. \nIn the previous round, Saina dished out a superb game to see off the World Championship bronze medallist Mitani 21-19 21-16 in a 41-minute. She was the only surviving Indian when she reached the quarterfinal stage as compatriots H S Prannoy, Ajay Jayaram, and women's doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa lost in the second round on Thursday.
