I’m not willing to lose that in just a couple of hands.”\nOK, so maybe there will be no World Series of Poker appearances in Mitchell’s future.\nWhat about a regular World Series?\nMitchell also walked across the McMahon Stadium parking lot to the Absolute Baseball Academy where he teed off in the batting cage and reportedly hit 84 mph on the radar gun off the mound.\nIt’s probably no surprise Mitchell could bring the heat.\nMaybe he has the stuff to play that other kind of ball but his recent performance was just a video shoot to promote October’s ‘wear pink’ campaign to battle breast cancer.\nSo he’ll have to settle for watching his beloved Houston Astros take a run at the crown.\nMitchell’s week of activities wasn’t quite done though.\nHe also found time to battle Edmonton Eskimos sack master Odell Willis in an online game of Madden.\n“I used to play (Ottawa RedBlacks defensive end Shawn) Lemon a lot when he was on the team,” Mitchell said. “Lemon’s pretty good. That’s what I do in my spare time. If I’m not watching film, instead of watching TV, I’d rather compete in something.\n“I said something to Lemon on Twitter about Madden, and Odell said ‘oh, you’re a Madden guy? Come play me.’ I was thinking ‘a lineman? Come on, man.’\n“Then he sends me his stats and he’s ranked in the top 1% in the world. I said ‘you play too much, bro.’ ”\nWillis’ Arizona Cardinals delivered a 57-36 beatdown on Mitchell’s Green Bay Packers.\n“It didn’t go well.”\nNo, it didn’t. But it provided CFL fans with some mid-week entertainment.\nMitchell said the only non-teammates he plays against are usually former ’mates.\n“Usually it’s just guys I’ve known from before like J.C. (Sherritt, Esks linebacker),” Mitchell said.\n“Odell’s a cool guy. He’s a competitor on the field and one of the best players out there. And he’s just trying to have fun.\n“I think it makes the league a bit better when guys are interacting doing things social media-wise for fans to see.”\nSounds like Willis has the inside track on that gamer gig.\nBut Mitchell won’t have to wait long to exact some revenge as the Stamps hosts the Esks on Saturday night.\nHopefully for Mitchell, video game football doesn’t translate to the big field.\nscott.fisher@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/SUNScottFisher\nStampeders\nCalgary Stampeders QB Bo Levi Mitchell coming off busy week\nBy Scott Fisher , Calgary Sun First posted: Thursday, October 08, 2015 10:26 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 09, 2015 12:29 AM EDT\nThey call it ‘Texas’ Hold ’em for a reason.\nAnd Texan Bo Levi Mitchell is pretty good.\nHe might have the skills to pursue a professional poker career.\nBut he doesn’t have the bankroll to prove it.\nThe Calgary Stampeders quarterback won chuckwagon driver Mark Sutherland’s fourth annual Texas Hold ’Em Invitational this week at Cowboys.\nIt was probably a decent windfall but Mitchell, the last one standing out of 240 competitors, threw the money back in the pot.\n“Once I won, they came to give me the envelope and I just said to give it back,” Mitchell said. “It’s a charity event, so I’m not trying to make money out there.”\nStamps teammates Charleston Hughes, Spencer Wilson, Matt Walter and Rene Paredes also attended Sutherland’s event at Cowboy’s, which raised $95,000 for local charities.\n“Being from Texas – you know, it’s Texas Hold ’Em – me and my brothers played a lot inside the house, just with pennies and nickels,” Mitchell said.\nTop ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SUNScottFisher", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:32:47.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
