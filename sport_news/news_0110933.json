Posted Oct. 3, 2015 at 1:44 AM PRESTON — Dale is about as synonymous with the state fast-pitch tournament as it gets. The Class 2A two-time defending state champion wasn’t pressed Friday as it wrapped up a dominating two-day regional tournament performance with a 14-0 blitz of Caney Valley, thus earning a state tournament slot. On Thursday, Dale posted a 10-0 win over Caney Valley and a 12-1 triumph over Hulbert. Dale advances to its fourth straight state tournament, which will run Thursday through Saturday at Oklahoma City’s Hall of Fame Stadium. Dale’s first-round foe and the game time have yet to be determined. Dale needed just five innings Friday as the game was called on the run rule. Victorious pitcher Taylor Powell (21-5) threw 35 pitches in a four-inning stint. She didn’t permit a hit or walk while fanning two. Delaney Manning, who pitched the final inning for Dale, gave up three hits and fanned three. Lacey Hood spearheaded Dale’s 12-hit attack with a double, triple and four runs batted in. Mikayla Rutland added two doubles and drove in three runs while Maddie Brownlie finished with two singles. “We’ve played well lately,” Dale coach Andy Powell said . “We have an experienced bunch so I feel good about our chances at state.” The Lady Pirates (29-6), ranked second in 2A behind Tushka, will play a warmup game at 5 p.m. Monday at Newcastle.
