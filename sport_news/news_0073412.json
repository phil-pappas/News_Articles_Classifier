Anything he was asked to do, (he was) never a disciplinary problem.\"\nOdom, who has a history of addiction, was found unconscious at a brothel in Nevada on Tuesday evening. The Rev. Jesse Jackson told reporters that Odom, 35, was on life support and improving. A Nevada county sheriff said investigators were seeking a blood sample to determine whether Odom had overdosed on alcohol or drugs.\nAmong those at his bedside were former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant and Odom's ex-wife, Khloe Kardashian . She and Odom had their own reality television show, \" Khloe & Lamar ,\" before they separated in 2013 and later divorced. Odom also made appearances on \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\"\nMassey remembered Odom, a native of Queens, having a docile, unassuming personality. Massey speculated it would have been easy for Odom to fall into the fast Hollywood lifestyle.\nMassey said he had similar concerns about Odom being influenced by the wrong people when he was at Redemption Christian. Massey said that's why he expelled Odom in 1997. Declining to mention names, Massey said he was concerned about \"handlers,\" people who were guiding the young basketball star's career.\n\"At an early age, you see it today, you get a lot of unscrupulous people involved in their life,\" Massey said. \"It's not unpredictable, his situation that he's in. I knew him when he was 16 or 17 years old, and it's not unpredictable. I mean, it's a tragedy.\"\nOdom, a 6-foot-10 forward, left Redemption Christian and enrolled at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in New Britain, Conn.\nHe played one year of college basketball at Rhode Island before he was taken fourth overall by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 1999 NBA draft.\nOdom's 14-year NBA career that included stops with the Clippers, Miami, the Los Angeles Lakers (where he won two NBA titles) and Dallas.\nHe made more than $115 million during his pro career, according to basketball-reference.com . He averaged 13.3 points per game for his career but never made an All-Star team.\nMassey said Odom could have been LeBron James before James himself but didn't live up to his vast potential.\nOdom was suspended in 2001 for violating the NBA's drug policy. He was stopped for drunken driving in Los Angeles in 2013 and later went into a drug and alcohol treatment center.\nMassey said he'll talk to his students at Redemption Christian about Odom's descent to reinforce a saying that Massey loves to teach them about making good choices.\n\"Where you go determines who you meet,\" he said. \"Who you meet determines what you think, what you think determines what you do, and what you do determines what you become.\"\nMassey said he hadn't heard from Odom in ages until he called last year. Odom asked if he could return to the Troy campus with a reality TV crew.\nMassey declined because he didn't want his school associated with the project.\nmsingelais@timesunion.com • 518-454-5509 • @MarkSingelais Wire services contributed to this report", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/52/8792713/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/52/8792714/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/52/8792714/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/52/8792713/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:26:58.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
