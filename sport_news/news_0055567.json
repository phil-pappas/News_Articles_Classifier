It will be an all Blue Springs Class 4 District 14 final as Blue Springs South toppled Truman 25-14, 25-21 and the host Wildcats slipped past Lee's Summit North 25-13, 25-27, 25-10 Tuesday night at Blue Springs High School. The 24-9 Jaguars and 20-8 Wildcats will meet in the championship game at 6 p.m. tonight at Blue Springs High School. An evening of smash-mouth volleyball began with South claiming an easier-than-anticipated 25-14 victory in the first set against Denise Craig's Patriots. Truman then roared back in the second game to claim a 20-15 lead, only to see the Jaguars score 10 of the next 11 points to advance to the championship game. “Truman is such a good team, and Lexi Hart is in a class by herself,” Jaguars coach Dave MacLean said, after Hart finished a brilliant prep career with 10 kills in the game. “You have to know where she is every time she is on the court, and we did a good job defending against her. That was one of the keys to our win. “We also showed signs of maturity tonight, especially in the second game. I'm proud of how we played, and now we have to find a way to come back strong against a great Blue Springs team tomorrow night.” South's Shanice Horn, who finished with five kills, echoed her coach's comments. “We wanted to have four hands (defending) Lexi all night because she is such an amazing player,” Horn said. “We played great defense and I thought we played smart volleyball and we were very aggressive in the second game when they got ahead 20-15. I'm proud of how we played and now we are excited to play Blue Springs. It should be a great match.” There were plenty of tears as the Patriot players said goodbye to Craig and each other following a 19-12 season. “I wanted to play so much longer with my girls,” Hart said, as tears flowed down her face. “I love our coaches and my girls. We didn't want it to end tonight.” Hart and Bri Savidge tied with 10 kills each. They have been starters for the Patriots the past four years. Hart will play volleyball at Minnesota and Savidge is going to attend the University of Missouri. “I'll miss the girls,” an emotional Craig said, “this is a special team with special players.” Alicia Starr was a showstopper in the Wildcats three-set win against North, as she finished with 21 kills - including two that ricocheted off her face - and a team-high 19 digs. “Yeah, I don't practice those much - that would hurt too much,” Starr said, grinning, when asked about the balls that struck her in the face then ricocheted over the net for Wildcat points. “This was a great match - a great match! Lee's Summit North is so good and they came back and won that second game and then we came back and won the third game. You could tell that neither team wanted the season to end.” Page 2 of 2 - The Broncos-Wildcats match featured players flying into the stands, over benches and somehow managing to return shots that bounced off the gym ceiling. “I've never seen so many balls hit off the ceiling,” Wildcats coach Katie Grusing said. “Both teams played so well. I know it will be tough for Rhea (Moses, Lee's Summit North coach) to appreciate how well her team played and what a great night of volleyball this was, but her kids were outstanding tonight. “Anna (Demmer) brought them back to win the second set. She is a great player and that is a great team. And we have a team that always seems to find a way to win. We had 71 digs tonight and we played as a team. We did all the little things you talk about in practice that you need to do to win a close match.” Kate Tucker, who had 12 digs, agreed with her coach. “Our team has such a strong chemistry and strong connection between each of our players and that was a key to winning tonight,” said Tucker, who flew into the stands chasing a ball. “Somehow, we found a way to come back and win the third game and now we get to play South again. It will be exciting and nerve-wracking. We're all excited.” Moses was disappointed her team's 25-9 season came to an end. “We were able to come back strong in the second game, but we didn't play as well as we can in the first and third games,” Moses said. “I'm proud of our girls, though. We had a good season, you just hate to see it come to an end.” By Bill Althaus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:17:55.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
