The two lawyers later reconciled and the sentence was not implemented.\nMansour is one of several prominent Mubarak-era figures who were accused of orchestrating the so-called \"Battle of the Camel\" during the 18-day uprising against dictator Hosni Mubarak, when a gang riding camels and horses charged into Tahrir Square and attacked protesters, killing 11 and injuring hundreds.\nIn 2012, Mansour and 24 others were acquitted of charges of inciting the violence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:19:21.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
