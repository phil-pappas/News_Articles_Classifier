That's after Henson said employees on Monday refused to let him in the store, then called police. \nIn a statement Wednesday, the NAACP's Milwaukee chapter said the store needs \"to take some bolder measures to demonstrate its clear acknowledgement of wrongdoing and serious commitment to change.\" \nA telephone message seeking comment from a store representative was not immediately returned Wednesday evening. Dixon earlier told WISN-TV that the incident was a misunderstanding. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:36:53.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
