The Dodgers' ace discarded his demons of playoff starts past and easily mowed the Mets in Los Angeles' 3-1 Game 4 win at Citi Field.\nKershaw was barely hittable. The Mets managed just three all night. Daniel Murphy smacked a solo home run in the fourth but there was little else.\nAnd Murphy's home run could not bring the Mets out of their hole. They fell behind 3-0 in the third when the Dodgers rallied against starter Steven Matz. With three singles and a two-run double by former Met Justin Turner they took an advantage they never lost.\nIt sends the Mets and Dodgers back to Los Angeles for one winner-take-all Game 5 at Dodger Stadium. The Mets will have Jacob deGrom on the mound and the Dodgers will start Zack Greinke.\n\"You're going up and Kershaw and Greinke again, you want to try to win this as quickly as possible,\" David Wright said Monday night. \"You definitely don't want to go back to L.A. and have Greinke there.\"\nNow they will. Still, the Mets always knew it would go like this. In a meeting before this NLDS began, Terry Collins told his team that they'd have to navigate the two Cy Young candidates twice each.\n\"What's it like?\" Collins said. \"Not a lot of fun knowing you gotta face those two guys. But we knew going into this.\"\nSTARTING PITCHER\nSteven Matz was rusty in his first start in 18 days. He allowed three runs over five innings, giving up six hits and walking two. He was bitten by a three-run third inning for the Dodgers when they notched four hits, including a two-run double by Justin Turner. Matz hadn't started for the Mets since Sept. 24 because of a back injury.\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\n#5üí™üèøüí™üèø pic.twitter.com/eTtjjJ0S3E\n‚Äî Jose Reyes (@lamelaza_7) October 14, 2015\nSTORYLINES TO FOLLOW\n‚Ä¢ Despite Clayton Kershaw's struggles against left-handed hitters in Game 1, manager Terry Collins never considered starting Michael Conforto. Instead he stuck with Juan Lagares in center field and Yoenis Cespedes in left again, using the same lineup as Monday night. Conforto came in to pinch-hit in the eighth for Lagares and flied out to right.\n\"We had a big night,\" Collins said. \"I said, you know what, I'm not going to mess with it.\"\n‚Ä¢ While Collins has grown increasingly reliant on Bartolo Colon this series, he's not ready to make his bridge to Jeurys Familia.\n‚Ä¢ Noah Syndergaard wasn't available in Game 4. Collins said he was still sore from his Game 2 start.\nBEHIND THE SCENES\n. @Mets owner Fred Wilpon with a nifty, behind-the-back throw during #Mets batting practice. #MLBPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/0h1E6vh8ZR\n‚Äî Andrew Mills (@AndyMills_NJ) October 13, 2015\nWHAT'S NEXT Game 5.
