As the new fiscal year begins, I am hopeful that the additional funds will help Director Thompson and her staff provide the animals with top-notch care and also help begin to stem the tide of unfixed animals. The increase includes hiring an additional kennel staff member to assist with cleaning, etc. and it also will pay for an additional day of vet services every week. These two items will improve the lives of the animals living at the shelter and help address the future intake numbers, thus saving tax dollars in the long run.\nOur county officials also took a giant step to address Bastrop Countyâ€™s pet overpopulation problem. They are going to be hiring a Spay/Neuter Coordinator for the county! Our county desperately needs a free & low cost spay/neuter clinic, but in the meantime, this person will hopefully be able to round up contributions from local businesses and tap into grant money to help lessen the number of unwanted dogs & cats being born. Everyday a continuous stream of dogs & cats are dropped off at the shelter and there are not enough homes for all of them. The new Spay/Neuter Coordinator has a blank canvas and will be able to set up programs to help animals and educate our citizens on responsible pet ownership. I am excited to see what this new person will be able to accomplish!\nThank you!\nLetter Suzy Swingle\nElgin", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/09/49/7d/letter-to-editor-300x204.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:05:12.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
