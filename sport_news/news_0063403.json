I think a lot of people have their main dudes, but we can all do a lot of work in the post,\" said forward Jamal Aytes, a UNLV transfer who missed 2014-15 for NCAA transfer regulations and injuries. \"We can get a bucket, defend and rebound. When you have that, it gives you depth, and when you have depth, it gives you more confidence. It makes us a stronger team going forward.\" \nThe BYU post presence will be on full display at the now-annual Boom Shakalaka showcase Friday at 7 p.m. at the recently renovated Marriott Center. The event, which will be broadcast on BYUtv, offers fans a chance to see the 3-point shooters and skill position challengers from both the men's and women's basketball teams. \nBut for new post and wing options like Aytes, Utah State transfer Kyle Davis, rising sophomore Corbin Kaufusi and 7-foot-2 returned missionary walk-on Alan Hamson, it's also a chance to see what they can do in 2015-16. \n\"I think a lot of the new guys bring us some versatility and depth,\" Aytes said of his fellow posts. \"Kyle Davis is big there. Corbin Kaufusi has also made strides in his game. Jakob Hartsock can shoot the three; he's lights out and can do it all. \n\"When you put all that together on the team, I think our upside is real high.\" \nThe new depth inside has made Hartsock, the 6-foot-8, 205-pound younger brother of former BYU standout Noah Hartsock, have to fast forward his development just a few months after returning from a two-year LDS Church mission in Las Vegas. I think a lot of the new guys bring us some versatility and depth. Kyle Davis is big there. Corbin Kaufusi has also made strides in his game. Jakob Hartsock can shoot the three; he's lights out and can do it all. When you put all that together on the team, I think our upside is real high. –BYU forward Jamal Aytes \n\"I don't really feel like a new guy anymore; I did during the summer, but not now,\" Hartsock said. \"Coaches see us as part of the team and they trust us to be a part of the team as much as anyone else in practice.\" \nPart of that new development involves posting up against the large bigs on BYU's roster, and even guarding some of the smaller wing players in practice. \n\"I love it. There will be some practices where I guard Corbin, who has 40 pounds on me,\" Hartsock added. \"Every time I get with the big men, I tell them to push me around. I want to get better, and the way I get better is by getting tougher and stronger in the post. I love playing with all of them, and all the depth we have. If someone gets hurt, we have someone for that position.\" \nDepth and versatility will be a hallmark of the BYU post presence in 2015-16. \n\"We have so many great players who can all contribute to this team. The depth is amazing,\" Hartsock said. Sean Walker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:24:03.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
