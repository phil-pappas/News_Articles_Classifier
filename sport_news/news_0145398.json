I thought it was right there,\" Williams said. \"You can probably tell me better. I thought it was close. Obviously, it's tough because you lose the game off it. You give those guys a second chance. You've got to go for it. \n\"I come from a place where we're looking to win, and that's what we want here, man. We're looking to win. I gave the effort that I did. Obviously, it went the other way. I was a little bit too aggressive. It's tough. It's a tough one to swallow, but you've got to forget about it.\" \nAlthough Williams' penalty allowed the Chargers to attempt, and make, a second potential game-winning field goal, the Browns felt there were plenty of plays leading up to that which cost them the game more so than the encroachment infraction. \n\"That's when you're in a desperation block situation. It's a very makeable field goal so you just feel like, 'I've got to try to time it up as best I can,'\" Browns coach Mike Pettine said. \n\"What do you say to him? I don't say anything. Here's a guy that had battled, played his tail off for 60 minutes, tried to make a play at the end of the game and was just a shade early. I'm not going to say anything to him other than, 'Thanks for your effort.'\" \nBrowns quarterback Josh McCown knows very well how Williams felt after the loss to the Chargers. \nIn last week's 27-20 loss to the Oakland Raiders at FirstEnergy Stadium, McCown led the Browns down the field and had them in position to score for the game-tying touchdown. However, McCown was intercepted by Raiders safety Charles Woodson with 38 seconds to play, a turnover that essentially ended the game. \n\"It's just hard,\" McCown said. \"You see something and you go to make a play and it doesn't turn out the way you want it to, it's heartbreaking. It's easy for everybody to point to that play, but individually, as competitors, we all walk out of that room, and it's no different with Tramon and Karlos Dansby, the pros in that room walk out of there and it's hard. All you think about are the plays that you could've done better. \n\"I won't think about Tramon doing that. I'll walk away thinking about what are the things that I could've done to keep those drives going, and I think that's the idea with the whole group. We get 53 guys thinking that way, we'll start making strides and some of these games will start going our way.\" \nWith the penalty against Williams and the loss to the Chargers now in the rearview mirror, Pettine knows one thing is for sure: he has to get his team ready for their AFC North Division opener at the Baltimore Ravens. \n\"Clearly, a frustrating finish,\" Pettine said. \"I told the guys that were out there battling at the end, guys that had to step up and play, I'm proud of them, but we made too many mistakes, penalties, some missed assignments here and there, just some things that were self-inflicted. \n\"You can't do that against a team like that. You can't do that against a quality quarterback like that, give them extra opportunities. It's a loss. We're 1-3. We own that, and we're going to do best what we know how to do, bunker in and get ready for Baltimore.\" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1Lekei7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:23:10.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
