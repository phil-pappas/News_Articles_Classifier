The Bulls have slipped to 2 & 4 on the season and need to right the ship fast. \nBoth teams are coming off of bad losses last Saturday. The Bulls lost to Central Michigan 51-14 and Ohio lost to Western Michigan 49-14. \nThe home team has won each of the last five meetings between the Bulls and Bobcats. \nUB head coach Lance Leipold said Tuesday the loss at Central Michigan was a big step in the wrong direction \"I think we came away from the Bowling Green game with a lot of positives and if you still look at what's happened since then, the defensive performance, the offensive ball control in that game we had a lot to build on. And to take the step back that we did is disappointing but it doesn't mean we can't mean we can't get ourselves back to where we want to be.\" \nTo get back where they need to be the Bulls offense needs to become more consistent. \"Its inconsistency right now. And we've got to find ways to become more consistent in what we're doing and by no means in what our offensive potential is and what our offensive production is, its not where it needs to be for us to be a team, a winning football team.\" Leipold said. \nKickoff is scheduled for 3:30 Saturday afternoon at UB Stadium.
