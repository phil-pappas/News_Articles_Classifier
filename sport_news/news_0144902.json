Odell Beckham is going to be a piñata for defenses, and there’s probably nothing he can do about that. He’s brought that on himself with the dangerous combination of his spectacular ability, his love of trash talk, and his refusal to back down from any kind of fight.\nBut if he wants to survive the beating and the baiting he will undoubtedly have to endure, he’s going to have to learn to do the one thing he won’t want to do — the one thing that might be harder than anything else.\nBeckham is going to have to learn to walk away.\nIt’s not cool; it’s not macho, and it goes against every bit of the tough-guy football culture, but the 22-year-old has to do it anyway. He didn’t during the messy fourth quarter in Buffalo on Sunday, and he’s lucky it only cost him a fine. The cost could’ve been a 15-yard penalty.\nInevitably, the cost of retaliation will end up being worse.\nRELATED: BILLS CALL BECKHAM A PUNCH-THROWING \"PRIMA DONNA\"\n“It’s tough to walk the line,” Beckham said. “You know they’re out there targeting you and they’re out there trying to do things to you. As much as somebody would say that they’re not, they are. But we’re out there to play football. That’s all that I came here to do.”\nThe Bills, of course, were physically all over Beckham during their 24-10 loss to the Giants on Sunday and verbally all over him two days later. They were furious over two punches he allegedly threw, and they called him a “prima donna,” a “golden boy” and compared him to a little boy throwing a “tantrum” when things got too rough. Sure, there was a little bit of “sore loser” in their words, as well as some hypocrisy from a team that Rex Ryan admittedly wanted to build into a “bully” and that drew 17 penalties in that game for 135 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:11:07.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
