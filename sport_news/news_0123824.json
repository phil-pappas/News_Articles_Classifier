However, president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said that prior experience in the dugout isn't everything during a press conference Thursday.\n\"My sense is we'll have candidates that have prior managerial experience and candidates that don't,\" Friedman said . \"I think for us to cast as wide of a net, have as thorough of a process as we want to end up with the guy we feel strongest about to lead this organization going forward - we're going to go into it with a really open mind.\"\nKapler and Friedman have a close relationship stemming from Kapler's playing days with Friedman's Tampa Bay Rays from 2009-10, something Rosenthal believes that could ultimately be the deciding factor in the process. However, several other notable candidates, including long-time Dodgers bench coach Tim Wallach, and former San Diego Padres skipper Bud Black, are rumored to be candidates for the high-profile position.\nFriedman hopes to have a new manager in place no later than the baseball Winter Meetings in early December.\nCopyright © 2015 Score Media Ventures Inc.
