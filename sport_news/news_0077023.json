We experienced what is commonly referred to a bad beatdown in North Andover as Billerica steamrolled the Scarlet Knights to remain unbeaten.\n History did not repeat itself in Wellesley as the Red Raiders snapped a 15-game losing streak to Walpole with a 7-6 victory, giving us our second loss. The final setback occurred at Endicott College where Marblehead kept us from an eight-win week by rallying to defeat Salem.\n On to Week 6 of the Thursday Pickorama .\n MILLIS-HOPEDALE over Ashland: Mohawks have played the tougher schedule and it will pay dividends here.\n Billerica over HAVERHILL: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Billerica gets the call here.\n Central Catholic over ANDOVER: Raiders prevail in a battle of former Thanksgiving Day sparring partners.\n EAST BRIDGEWATER over Dighton-Rehoboth: Dave Driscoll has done another fantastic job at D-R, but this appears to be a tall order.\n St. John's Prep over BC HIGH: Eagles inching closer to the showdown with Xaverian.\n CARDINAL SPELLMAN over St. Mary's: Cardinals in the midst of a huge two-game slate with Bishop Fenwick to follow.\n NEWTON SOUTH over Westford Academy: A classic pick-em game.\n MILTON ACADEMY over BB&N: Pretty much a must-game for both teams to remain in consideration for a bowl berth.\n St. Sebastian's over LAWRENCE ACADEMY: Gallagher brothers lead the way.\n NANTUCKET over West Bridgewater: Whalers roll in a battle of unbeatens.\n LAST WEEK: 7-3 (.700)\n SEASON TO DATE: 38-12 (.500)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:19:44.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
