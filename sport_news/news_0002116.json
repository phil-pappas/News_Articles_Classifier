(KKTV) - A visit to a neighborhood park turned terrifying when a 2-year-old boy found a real gun by the playground.\nIt happened in a quiet neighborhood in northeast Colorado Springs near Marksheffel and Barnes.\n\"My son picked up a .22 caliber handgun and pointed it at me and said, 'Look mama, I shoot you,'\" the mother said. She asked not to be identified.\nShe said the whole thing was a shock.\n\"My coffee dropped, my cup broke. The first thing was to get it out of his hands,\" she said.\nShe brought it inside her home and called 911. Police say she did the right thing.\n\"Being that there is a good chance that another child could have found the firearm, it's an excellent idea that the parent picked the gun up and secured it so that it was safe,\" said Lt. Catherine Buckley with the Colorado Springs Police Department.\nPolice said that gun is one of more than a dozen guns that were stolen out of a Rockey's Moving and Storage unit less than 10 miles away.\n\"At that age they're curious, so if there was something in it, that could have been fatal for me, him or anyone around us,\" the boy's mother said.\nCSPD said this is the only gun they have found so far connected to those stolen from the storage unit.\nIf you know anything about this case, contact police right away.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/gunfoundinpark.jpeg", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/BFE/FC7/BFEFC7A0AEC349AEA7879B430524B5DD.mp4", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/gunfoundinpark.jpeg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:17:39.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
