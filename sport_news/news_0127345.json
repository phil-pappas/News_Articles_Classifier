Just trying to focus on the season. … Coach loves it. He thought it was a great idea.”\nWhitehead, a Coney Island native and preseason second-team all-league selection, said they have yet to come up with the consequences for breaking the rule. Posting photos on Instagram is allowed.\n“For every two good things someone says, there are going to be seven bad things,” Willard said. “After a while, the negativity kinds of beats you down. … It is a distraction at times. It really can get you overwhelmed. My biggest thing with these guys is to keep them to stay focused on how well they can play.\n“My biggest problem with these devices, if you watch when they’re on it, it’s 1:00 in the morning. We talk a lot about how much sleep kids needs to get, how much rest you need to get. You can’t rest if your phone is constantly dinging, and their phones are constantly dinging. It’s non-stop. The more they’re off their phones, the more I’m in favor of it.”\n  Filed under isaiah whitehead ,  kevin willard ,  seton hall pirates", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:04:43.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
