Watson, who splits time at setter with senior Jenna Berthold, had a match-high 13 assists. Pantale, who also earned first-team All-Passaic honors last season, had a match-high 12 kills. \nLozy, Watson, and Pantale triggered a pivotal run in each set that enabled Wayne Valley to pull away from Clifton (19-6). During both spurts, Watson’s float serve was instrumental in keeping the Mustangs from making a good pass. \nIn the first set, the Indians rode a 9-0 run to an 18-7 lead. Watson served eight of her match-high 12 points, and Pantale had four kills. \n\"Olivia Lozy is a phenomenal libero and she gets everywhere and puts up nice passes,\" Watson said, \"and I just trust Olivia [Pantale], and know if I give her the ball that she is going to put it down.\" \nIn the second set, the trio was in the center of a 5-0 run to extend the margin to 18-12. Watson served four points and Pantale had a trio of kills. \n\"It all starts with the pass. So once it goes to Ally Watson, I know she’s going to put it where I can put it right down,\" Pantale said, \"and I really have trust in her and faith in our connection.\" \n\"We were serving tough, we were keeping them out of system and we were really able to take advantage of that particular rotation,\" Carcich said. \nWhen Lozy to Watson to Pantale wasn’t there, Clifton managed to hang in there with strong court coverage. But the Mustangs totaled 19 service and hitting errors, and that kept them from threatening the Indians down the stretch in each set. \n\"I told them we had to go out and play the near-perfect game, and we just didn’t,\" Clifton coach Nick Romanak. \"Too many missed serves. Serving has been the strongest part of our game, and if I don’t have my girls going back and rallying three or four points each, a few of the girls at least, it really puts us at a disadvantage.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:06:07.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
