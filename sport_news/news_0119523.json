That's because the No. 16 Cardinal (4-1, 3-0 Pac-12) is on a bye week leading up to next Thursday's home game against UCLA (4-1, 1-1). \n\"I think it's coming at a great time for us right now,\" said Stanford coach David Shaw, who is glad to give his players time to heal, particularly on the defensive line. \nAnother player who will benefit from the rest is quarterback Kevin Hogan, who's been hobbled by a sprained ankle suffered three weeks ago at USC. \n\"Another week for Kevin I think would be great,\" Shaw said. \"He would play on Saturday, but it's nice to know that if we take a little bit more time he might be closer to 100 percent.\" \nNot that the injury has hampered the fifth-year senior's ability to read defenses and pile on points, with Stanford averaging 46 points in its past three wins -- a stark contrast to the season opener, when it lost 16-6 at Northwestern. \nShaw even teases his quarterback about how the injury has increased Hogan's patience in the pocket. \n\"I say we should have kicked him in the ankle early last year,\" Shaw joked. \"No, he's been that way before the ankle. Once again, we all had a bad game early on, but after that, that's the way he's been. ... It's the way he's been all through training camp. He's got a calm about him. All the ankle has done is slowed him down a bit as a runner, but as far as his pocket mechanics, he's been outstanding in the pocket.\" Advertisement \nThe Cardinal took Monday off before practices Tuesday and Wednesday, and won't return to the practice facility until Saturday to prep for UCLA. \n\"It doesn't really matter when the bye week is,\" said inside linebacker Blake Martinez, who after the 55-17 rout of Arizona led the nation with 63 total tackles. \"It's just whenever we have it, we take advantage of the recovery time and getting the body parts back to normal. And also just going back to little things. I know I talked to our special teams coach today, Coach (Pete) Alamar, and he was talking about just working on little punt footwork and little fundamentals like that and kind of perfecting those before we get into next week.\" Running with purpose Sophomore running back Christian McCaffrey leads the nation in all-purpose yards at 229.80 per game. Through five games, he's gained 601 rushing, 168 receiving, 22 on punt returns and 358 on kickoff returns. \nIt's the kind of production Shaw envisioned from the son of former NFL wide receiver Ed McCaffrey, who also played at Stanford. \n\"I'll never forget, Ed came to our last scrimmage last year before we started the season and I grabbed and let him know, 'There's no chance your son is redshirting, because if I redshirted your son, there might be revolt on this football team,' \" Shaw said. \"Because we saw it, we see it every day. He's got a special skill set, he's got a fire in his belly to be great and you see it and feel it every day.\" \nGlyn Milburn set the Stanford record for all-purpose yards in 1990, averaging 202 per game. But it's just a coincidence that McCaffrey changed his jersey from the No. 27 he wore as a freshman. \n\"This past year in the offseason, when Christian said he wanted to change to No. 5, I kind of chuckled because that was Glyn's number,\" Shaw said. \"Just to me in my experience, I chuckle sometimes because I think they are similar players.\" First of many? Redshirt freshman Keller Chryst, who is competing for the backup gig to Hogan, made a statement Saturday with a pancake block in the second quarter on a designed run. \nThat wasn't his only contribution in the win at Stanford Stadium. The Palo Alto High grad engineered an 11-play, 57-yard drive in the fourth quarter that culminated with a 6-yard touchdown pass -- a fade to wide receiver Rollins Stallworth. It was a first for both players. \n\"It was a great ball,\" Shaw said. \"It was a ball that gives him a chance to make a play.\" \nThe play was a run-pass option, and once Arizona loaded up the box with nine players, Chryst took his one-on-one shot outside. \n\"It was a great moment finally getting my first touchdown pass in two years,\" said Chryst, who had a 33-yard touchdown run on the drive negated by a holding penalty. \nThe milestone, though, doesn't mean Shaw is ready to name Chryst as the backup over junior Ryan Burns. \n\"I think both guys are continuing to get ready to play,\" Shaw said. \"It's fluid.\" Finding the right fit While the players get Thursday and Friday off, the coaches are hitting the recruiting trail. \n\"I'm going to Southern California,\" Shaw said. \nThere is always pressure on the staff to find the right combination of talent to play Pac-12 football combined with academics to get through the admissions process. \n\"There are guys that go down an academic path and they don't get admitted,\" Shaw said. \"And that's going to happen every single year for a few, and that's just where were are. Our admissions, especially with our graduation rate, they've been right. ... I think our coaches have done a really good job to make sure that every year that number gets lower and lower and lower of guys that are denied just because we are able to be more selective. \n\"There's some guys that we start the recruiting process on late sophomore year, early junior year. And by the time the end of junior year it's not admissions, it's us letting him know, 'You know what, you're not going to make it. You're not going down the right path. You're probably going to need to choose some place else.\" 'Untold Stories of the E.R.' On pace to graduate in the spring with a degree in human biology, left guard Joshua Garnett would like to enroll in medical school if this football hobby of his doesn't work out. His field of choice? Emergency medicine. \n\"I just like the rush, it's a lot like football,\" Garnett said. \"I mean, everyone is working together, everyone has their separate jobs and it's really high-paced, high-intensity environment, but you have to be calm and collective.\" \nThat might explain why he's a fan of the TV show \"Untold Stories of the E.R.\" \n\"I used to love watching that show and just seeing all the stories and all the crazy stuff,\" Garnett said. \nAt 6 feet 5 and 321 pounds, his skill set compares favorably to David DeCastro, who was drafted with the 24th overall pick out of Stanford by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2012. \n\"That's rarefied air, and I think that's what Josh would aspire to be,\" Shaw said. \"Josh is bigger than David. Athleticism is similar. It's tough to say. I think Josh has got to play some more games before we put him in that category just yet, let's finish out the season. But DeCastro was truly special. Guards don't go midway through the first round, and David did. But I think Josh is nipping at his heels as far as being able to be that consistent and play at a high level for an entire season.\" \n\"He's one of the greats,\" Garnett said. \"If I can even be close to what he does, I would be happy. Just watching so much film of him and David Yankey and some of the guards that have been before us, it's definitely great.\" TV makes the rules UCLA drew the short end of the stick as far as the Pac-12 schedule. The Bruins are scheduled to play back-to-back Thursday night contests, with a game in the Rose Bowl against No. 23 Cal (5-0, 2-0) scheduled a week after the trip to Stanford. \nUCLA coach Jim Mora is none too happy, and Shaw offered his support. \n\"It's what is not supposed to happen,\" Shaw said. \"When you have a Thursday night game, you're supposed to be able to have a couple of days in the front end like we did and a couple of days on the back end. And he's not getting those, so I echo his sentiments. It's not supposed to happen. There are some scheduling things that because of TV we have to do things that we do.\" Email Vytas Mazeika at vmazeika@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at Twitter.com/dailynewsvytas .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:24:56.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
