Fans cheer on Cincinnati Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert after he scored a touchdown against the Chargers. (Photo: The Enquirer/Sam Greene) \nFor today's story in the paper which posted online last night I wrote about the versatility of the running game and snug fit Gio Bernard has been to the Andy Dalton arrival . The Bengals best weapons are having A.J. Green, Marvin Jones, Mo Sanu and Tyler Eifert all on the field at the same time. That sets up well for the quickness and receiving ability of Bernard. That's a large reason why he's been featured so much and enjoyed so much success. \nYou can read about there here , including Hue Jackson still standing behind Jeremy Hill promising his time will come as different types of defenses confront the Bengals. \nAs I researched the story, I searched this streak of five straight games with at least 389 yards gained by the Bengals against franchise history. I found this to be only the second time a Bengals offense achieved such a streak, the last coming 1986. \nHey look -- nugget. \nThought today's Walkthru would offer an opportunity to take the stat a step further. How does this stand up in all of the NFL over the last 10 years? The answer: Pretty well. \nSince the rule changes allowed offenses to blossom five years ago you can see the bump in teams running off streaks like this, but it's still not that long. \nSince 2005, here are the number of teams with a streak of at least five straight games in the same season gaining at least 389 yards as the Bengals have. Year: Team (Streak) -- Average per game 2015: Bengals (5 games) -- 421 2014: Broncos (6 games) -- 442 2014: Cowboys (5 games) -- 424 2014: Colts (7 games) -- 473 2014: Saints (7 games) -- 445 2013: Patriots (6 games) -- 471 2013: Eagles (6 games) -- 450 2013: Broncos (13 games) -- 466 2012: Saints (5 games) -- 460 2011: Saints (6 games) -- 518 2011: Saints (5 games) -- 482 2011: Packers (7 games) -- 423 2011: Patriots (5 games) -- 496 2010: Eagles (7 games) -- 435 2010: Chargers (5 games) -- 462 2009: Saints (5 games) -- 436 2009: Patriots (5 games) -- 470 2007: Jaguars (5 games) -- 422 2007: Patriots (8 games) -- 437 \nIf the Bengals top 389 this week against Buffalo, eight teams fall off this list. That would only leave 10 others. Pretty elite company. \nAlso, consider the number of teams to accomplish this task. You have the Saints on here five times with Drew Brees, Broncos on here twice with Peyton Manning, Patriots four times with Tom Brady, Eagles twice and then Packers, Chargers, Jaguars and Colts once. That's a total of eight franchises. \nEnjoy this while it lasts, folks. This ranks among the best offensive runs in the last 10 years. \nTWITTER QUESTION OF THE DAY @pauldehnerjr @JimOwczarski When is the first game that @King55Tez is eligible to play? â€” Josh McCullough (@JoshMcCullough4) October 12, 2015 \nThanks for the question, Josh. \nThe first game Vontaze Burfict will be eligible to return is Nov. 1 against Pittsburgh. As for if that means he will return, nobody quite knows. The last we officially heard about Burfict was at cutdown day when Marvin Lewis made it sound like he expected him to return on that date near 100 percent. At this point, we can't be so sure. Until he's allowed to practice with the team his status will be a shrug. There's a difference between running through ropes on the side and taking on the Steelers at Heinz Field. Once he does return, there's no telling how the knee will respond or how he'll respond mentally. Ideally, the Bengals want him to be a difference-maker in December and January. That's probably where his impact lies, assuming he can get back by then. \nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT \nLewis not interested in puffing smoke . Fairly expected, though, I couldn't help myself from just asking him why he can't just be excited about 5-0 including the win against Seattle. He's in head down, blinders on mode at this point. \nMy best and worst from Sunday's win. More good than bad, obviously, for the home team. \nBEYOND THE STRIPES \nLive from Moerlein Lager House tonight at 7 p.m. Adam Jones will be our guest. But he won't be alone, we'll have another special guest with us, show up or watch on Cincinnati.com to find out who. \nIn case you're not familiar, Jones might have a few things to say. Should be more than a little entertaining at The Banks. \nCincinnati Bengals cornerbacks Adam Jones (24) and Dre Kirkpatrick (27) dance and sing during warmups before kick off of the NFL pre-season game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Chicago Bears.

Large win for Pittsburgh at SD last night. \nRavens (1-4): Baltimore defense on pace to be the worst in franchise history . \nKNOW YOUR OPPONENT \nBuffalo (3-2): Buffalo News calls for the Bills to let Tyrod Taylor use his running ability more to spark the offense. \nBENGALS TWEET OF THE DAY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:03:26.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
