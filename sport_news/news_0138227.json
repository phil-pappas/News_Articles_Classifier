However, the Dodgers advanced beyond the NL Division Series just once under Mattingly.\nUSA TODAY\nDaniel Murphy's HR lifts Mets over Dodgers, advance to NLCS\nAnd after another early exit from the postseason, Mattingly's future with the organization became uncertain. The Dodgers, whose $300 million payroll was the largest in the majors, were eliminated in five games by the New York Mets in the NLDS.\nWhen asked about his future with the organization after the Dodgers were eliminated, Mattingly was irate.\nMattingly was in his first season under the new duo of president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman and general manager Farhan Zaidi.\n“As our end of season process began, we discussed the past year, our future goals, necessary changes, roster needs and other matters relating to next year’s campaign,” Friedman said in a statement released by the club. “As the dialogue progressed daily, it evolved to a point where we all agreed that it might be best for both sides to start fresh. We decided to think about it for a couple of days and when we spoke again, we felt comfortable that this was the direction to go. I have the utmost respect for Donnie and thoroughly enjoyed working with him this past season. I want to thank him for his hard work and collaboration, as well as his accomplishments, including three consecutive National League West titles. I wish him nothing but success in the future.”\nMattingly may not be out of work long, as four other clubs also are seeking new managers. Multiple reports have linked him to the Miami Marlins opening.\n“I’m honored and proud to have had the opportunity to manage the Los Angeles Dodgers,” said Mattingly in the club statement. “I’ve enjoyed my experiences and relationships with the organization’s staff and players throughout my eight years in L.A. After meeting with Andrew, Farhan and Josh, we all felt that a fresh start would be good for both the organization and me. We talked about several scenarios, including my returning in 2016. However, I believe this is the right time and right move for both parties.\n\"I’m still very passionate about managing and hope to get the opportunity in the near future. In the meantime, I want to thank the Dodger organization, the city and our fans for the opportunity and wish the club well going forward.”\nMattingly's managerial career began in 2011 when he was hand-picked by Joe Torre. He has a 446-363 (.551) record as manager, the sixth-best winning percentage in frranchise history.\nGALLERY: MANAGERIAL CAROUSEL\nOct. 9: The Mariners fired Lloyd McClendon after two seasons with the club.
