Lyon, also 10 points behind in France, has only one point from its two Champions League matches.\nIn the other group match, Valenica will face Belgian champion Gent.\nHere are some things to know about Tuesday's matches:\n___\nLOOKING FOR A BOOST\nAfter a superb campaign in the French league and ambitious recruitment during the offseason, Lyon was expected to play a leading role this season.\nBut after 10 games in the French league, the seven-time champions are already trailing Paris Saint-Germain by 10 points and still looking for a win in the Champions League.\nInjuries are part of the problem. France international Nabil Fekir has been out since early September while attacking midfielder Clement Grenier has not played a game so far because of a thigh problem.\nLast week, striker Aldo Kalulu was sidelined for up to two months after damaging ligaments in his left ankle.\n\"It's obvious that it is hard for us to score these days,\" Lyon coach Hubert Fournier said after a 1-1 draw at Monaco. \"There were glimpses of good football by halftime. Hopefully we will be better by Tuesday. We need to play more freely if we want to continue our Champions League dream.\"\n___\nUP AND DOWN\nZenit St. Petersburg has had its ups and downs.\nThe Russian team leads Group H after starting with wins over Valencia and Gent, but hopes of a league title defense are fading fast. Following a 2-2 draw with Kuban Krasnodar on Saturday, Zenit is 10 points off the lead and five off the Champions League places.\nZenit coach Andre Villas-Boas' future is in the balance, too. He wants to leave at the end of the season, but there is widespread speculation in Russia that club management may not let him survive that long.\nVillas-Boas has also been serving a six-game ban in Russia for striking a match official.\nWhile striker Hulk is fit for Lyon's visit after a minor hip issue, Zenit has its own injury problems. Defenders Domenico Criscito, Igor Smolnikov and Ezequiel Garay, plus midfielder Viktor Faizulin, all missed Saturday's game with various medical difficulties.\nMikhail Kerzhakov, usually the reserve goalkeeper, is likely to start since Yuri Lodygin remains benched following some notable errors in recent weeks.\n___\nBAD VIBES\nA return to the Champions League after a two-year absence was supposed to mark the end of a difficult stretch for Valencia and a new start for the two-time finalists.\nIt hasn't worked so far.\nValencia coach Nuno Espirito Santo dropped striker Alvaro Negredo for the 3-0 win over Malaga following some critical comments about the coach's lineups.\n\"All my decisions are exclusively based on coaching strategy and what's best for the match,\" Espirito Santo said.\n___\nNO ONE HIT WONDER\nUnlike some of its rivals in Group H, Gent is doing just fine at home.\nAfter winning its first Belgian league title in its 115-year history, Gent is unbeaten in 11 games this season. The team is still looking for a win in the Champions League, however.\nDefensively, Gent has conceded goals in eight of its last nine games in all competitions, including an opening 1-1 draw with Lyon in the Champions League and a 2-1 loss at Zenit.\nA win over Valencia would be Gent's first against a Spanish team in any UEFA competition.\n4 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
