When the shots rang out, Parr pushed Reagan inside the presidential limousine and it sped away for the White House.\nAfter Reagan complained of chest pains and showed blood on his lips, Parr redirected the limousine to George Washington Hospital. As it turned out, Reagan had been hit in the chest and was bleeding internally. Doctors later said that any delay would have cost the president his life.\nThe shooting seriously wounded James Brady, the White House press secretary . The bullet damaged the right section of his brain, paralyzing his left arm, weakening his left leg, damaging his short-term memory and impairing his speech. He went on to become a vocal gun-control advocate, and remained so until his death in 2014. A Secret Service agent and a District of Columbia police officer were also injured in the attack.\nHinckley, 25 at the time, was arrested and found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting and sent to a Washington mental hospital.\nIn a statement Friday, former first lady Nancy Reagan called Parr \"one of my true heroes.\"\nSecret Service Director Joseph Clancy said Parr's actions \"preserved the institution of the Office of the Presidency.\"\n\"Every Secret Service agent was well aware of what he did for not only the Secret Service, but more importantly, his country,\" Clancy wrote in a statement on Saturday.\nParr was born on Sept. 16, 1930, in Birmingham, Alabama. An Air Force veteran, he joined the Secret Service in 1962. He retired in 1985 and became an ordained minister.\nHe is survived by his wife, Carolyn, and three daughters.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/james-s-brady-reagans-press-secretary-and-survivor-of-1981-shooting-dies-at-73/2014/08/04/4af0af70-c5da-11df-94e1-c5afa35a9e59_story.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:24:06.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
