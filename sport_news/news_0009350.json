(Kathy Willens / AP) Dom Amore Contact Reporter Clayton Kershaw, working on short rest, held the Mets to three hits over seven innings. \nNEW YORK — The champagne was chilling, but it was the Mets' bats that went ice cold on Tuesday night. \nThere was no Division Series clincher because this turned out to be the night the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw, the best pitcher in baseball over the past five seasons, finally extended his regular-season dominance into October. \nKershaw, working on short rest, held the Mets to three hits over seven innings to win, 3-1, at Citi Field and square his team, 2-to-2, forcing a fifth and deciding game to be played in Los Angeles on Thursday night. \nMets rookie lefthander Steven Matz went five innings, giving up three runs in the third. He actually pitched rather well, a bloop single by Adrian Gonzalez figuring prominently into the rally, and relievers beginning with ageless Bartolo Colon held the Dodgers at three runs. But to beat Kershaw at his best, one has to be just about perfect, as Jacob deGrom was to win Game 1, and as deGrom will have to be again to beat Zack Greinke, another former Cy Young winner, in Game 5. \nIf the Mets win Thursday, they will play the Cubs in the NLCS beginning Saturday. If they lose, the Cubs will go to L.A. and the Mets will forever curse the Chase Utley take-out slide that turned Game 2 in the Dodgers' favor and, as it looks now, may have prevented the Mets from sweeping this series. \n\"What happened at the trade deadline was crazy,\" Flores said before Game 4 of the National League Division Series. \"But it happened for a reason. And this is the reason.\" ... ... (DOM AMORE) \nEx-Met Justin Turner, 7-for-15 in the series, followed Gonzalez's hit with a two-run double, which proved to be the winning hit. \nKershaw, 27, is 114-56 with a 2.43 ERA in the regular season, with three Cy Young Awards and an MVP since 2011. And, despite his 1-6 record and 4.99 ERA in previous postseason starts, it was an easy call for manager Don Mattingly to trust his season, and perhaps his job, with Kershaw on three days of rest. \nHe walked only one, and struck out eight, and pitched with such efficiency, mixing power and finesse at the highest level, the short rest became a non-issue. The only blemish on Kershaw's night was a solo homer by Daniel Murphy, who did the same to help deGrom defeat Kershaw in Game 1. (DOM AMORE) \nBut Mattingly was not willing to push Kershaw, who threw 94 pitches, past seven innings and perhaps tempted fate by going to his bullpen in the eighth inning. When Chris Hatcher issued a two-out walk to Curtis Granderson, Mattingly went to his closer, Kenley Jansen, to get the final four outs. David Wright worked a walk, but Murphy flied to right to end the inning. \nThe Mets had pounded the Dodgers 13-7 in Game 3 to put themselves on the brink of clinching the series, but that will be the only game started by someone other than Kershaw or Greinke. Facing those two four times in five games, as Mets manager Terry Collins has repeatedly pointed out, makes winning this series a \"tall order,\" as good as the Mets' young pitchers are. \nMatz developed a sore back in mid-September, and was starting Game 4 Tuesday without having pitched for three weeks. So it was reasonable to wonder if he would be sharp at the outset. \nIn fact, he breezed through the first two innings with only 28 pitches, and appeared rather settled when the bottom of the Dodgers order came up in the third. But Kershaw got the first hit of the game — who had that in the pool? — with one out. Howie Kendrick singled with two out, and then Adrian Gonzalez's pop fly dropped in short center, an RBI single. Turner, the former Met turned Mets-killer, scorched a double inside the left field line to drive in two and give the Dodgers a 3-0 lead, a hush falling over the Citi Field crowd. \nThe Mets were trailing 3-0 early on Monday night, too, but they weren't facing Kershaw. Just before the first pitch, Kershaw was stomping up and down the dugout, hollering, high-fiving and chest-bumping teammates as if he were about to play a college football game, and he carried the emotion to the mound, reacting on nearly every early pitch. \nHe was amped up, all right, and he retired 10 of the first 11 batters, allowing only a walk. But Murphy got the barrel of his bat to an 0-1 pitch and drove it over the wall in right to get the Mets on the board, and the crowd briefly back into the game. \nMatz struck out Corey Seager to strand two runners in the fifth, keeping the Mets in it. Then he was lifted for pinch hitter Michael Cuddyer, who struck out to end the fifth on Kershaw's 71st pitch. \nColon relieved for the second night in a row and set the Dodgers down in the sixth, striking out two. But the Mets could neither hit Kershaw, nor make him work particularly hard to get them out, and he carried his 3-1 lead into the late innings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:15:23.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
