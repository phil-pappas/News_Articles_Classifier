Nolito’s sixth goal of the season left him level with Ronaldo and Benzema, and two goals behind Neymar. \nCelta’s win left Madrid as leader on goal difference after its 3-0 victory over Levante on Saturday. Celta is second, followed by Barcelona in third after the defending champions routed Rayo Vallecano 5-2, also on Saturday. \n“We think we can beat anyone, that we can go to any ground and show that we can win because we are a solid team that works hard and is dangerous,” said coach Eduardo Berizzo, whose Celta side stunned Barcelona 4-1 last month. \nVillarreal, which entered the round in first place, fell all the way to fifth, two points off the pace. \nAtletico Madrid moved into fourth on goal difference with a 2-0 win at Real Sociedad, which has just one win this season. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:54:07.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
