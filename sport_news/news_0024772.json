I’m happy with the effort. I thought we sustained 120 minutes of hard hockey this weekend. That’s the thing I’m most excited about.” \nClarkson dominated the opening period on the shot count, but held just a 1-0 lead heading into the break thanks to a Jordan Boucher goal at 4 minutes, 59 seconds. \nThe Purple Eagles (0-2) answered early in the second period when Nick Farmer scored a rebound goal by lofting a shot over the shoulder of Clarkson goalie Steve Perry at 2:20 to tie the game 1-1. \n“The first period was one of the worst periods we’ve had in over a decade,” Niagara coach Dave Burkholder said. “It’s no disrespect to (Clarkson), but we were spinning our tires. But after the first they had thrown everything at us and were only down 1-0. We came out in the second and actually won a couple shifts and made it 1-1. We just didn’t have enough answers. \n“It’s just one of those nights we’re going to forget and move on to our next weekend.” \nThe game stayed even for another 11 minutes and then Clarkson went on a spurt, scoring three goals in 3:54 to put the game away. \nSam Vigneault started the scoring by connecting from just outside the crease at 13:34 while Clarkson was on a power play. \nDefenseman Kevin Tansey made it 3-1 at 16:16 with his first goal of the season and his ninth career goal. \n“We took it to them and Troy (Josephs) got to the wall and made a great pass and I just shot it and it went in,” Tansey said. “When they got their first goal, they kind of jumped back into the game for a second. Getting those three goals quick was real good for us. It was important for us to get the grasp back of the game and get more in control again.” \nBrett Gervais ended the spurt by scoring at 17:28, with Vigneault picking up an assist along with Nic Pierog. \nPerry finished with 16 saves and improved to 3-0 lifetime against Niagara. \nJeff DiNallo helped Clarkson to a 34-29 edge in faceoffs by going 12-7. Freshman Marly Quince, who blocked six shots this weekend, went 8-3 in the circle. \nClarkson takes to the road for its first away games of the season next weekend, facing Merrimack on Friday and New Hampshire on Saturday.
