The boy accused of the murder, now 15, was 12 years old at the time Leila was found in a pool of blood in her bedroom on April 27, 2013. She had been stabbed 22 times, mostly in the chest, and suffered at least 14 poke wounds. The boy, whose name is not being used because he is a juvenile, was arrested in May 2013 and charged with second-degree murder in connection with Leila’s death. Dressed in a plaid dress shirt and dark jeans, he occasionally looked around the Calaveras County Superior Court Department 3 courtroom, but mostly looked directly ahead. Barney Fowler, the father, and Crystal Fowler, the stepmother, were also present. Nick Lang, 20, testified Wednesday he encountered a suspicious man sometime in April 2013, shortly before he heard of Leila’s death. Lang said he attended a party in Lockeford with a friend and, as they were driving back to his friend’s house in Lodi, they got into an argument. Lang got out of his friend’s vehicle near Victor and continued to Lodi on foot. As he was walking, Lang said he was approached by a caucasian man with long hair carrying a kitchen knife. “He told me he was walking from Valley Springs,” Lang said. “He said people were getting killed out there.” Lang said the man was 5’8 to 5’9, had facial hair and was wearing torn clothing. “He was pretty beat up,” he said. Lang said he picked up a stick and kept a distance from the man because he felt “very uncomfortable.” Lang was eventually picked up by his friend’s mother near Victor. The next day, Lang found out Leila was killed. Lang added that he has struggled with substance abuse problems in the past, but was not impaired that night. Johannes Versendaal testified Wednesday that, on the day of the murder, he saw an “unusual” man in the area around 6 or 7 p.m. At the time of Leila’s death, Versendaal lived on Hartvickson Lane, one street over from Leila’s home. “I saw someone walking across my property,” he said. “He was acting very suspicious, as if he didn’t want to be seen.” Versendaal said the man appeared to be Hispanic and was about 6 feet tall, with a stocky build. He was clean-shaven and had short black hair. As the man walked down his driveway, Versendaal said he went outside to try to get the attention of Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office volunteers. The man fled the area. “He sped off,” Versendaal said. “And that was the last time I saw him.” Kelly Panzarino, one of Leila’s neighbors, testified Wednesday that around the time Leila was killed, she saw a man in the area who “stood out.” Panzarino said as she and her husband were leaving their home to pick up their granddaughter when she noticed a man walking down Hartvickson Lane. It was “unseasonably hot” that day, she said, and the man was wearing a long-sleeved shirt, dark jeans and boots. She thought he was “overdressed for the conditions.” Panzarino said the man was American-Indian, had shoulder-length black and white hair and appeared to be in his 50s. He was between 5’10 and 6’0 and had a “very distinct” nose. “His nose had like a hook to it,” Panzarino said. Panzarino said she described what the man looked like to a sketch artist, but said the artist seemed to get frustrated with her when the drawing did not match her description. A 17-year-old girl testified Wednesday that she and a friend explored a vacant house near Leila’s home a week to a week and a half prior to Leila’s death. The girl, who knows one of the defendant’s sisters, said she asked the defendant if he wanted to join. He declined. The girl said she and her friend entered the vacant house through an unlocked door connected to the garage. As they entered the house, the girl said there were newspapers scattered all over the living room floor. In one of the rooms in the home, there was a television on the floor. The girl said the television was plugged in and playing static. “There were beer cans on the floor and a couple of water bottles,” she said. In a bathroom of the home there was toilet paper in the toilet, the girl said. The girls then entered the kitchen. There, they found paper towels and an opened box of saltine crackers on the counter. At that point, the girl said she heard an adult male’s voice say, “Get out.” “That’s when we ran,” she said. The girls fled to her house on Hartvickson Lane. The girl did not see anyone in the house, but said the voice sounded like “regular English.” Barney Fowler also took the stand Wednesday and testified that it was hot outside on the day Leila was killed. He said Leila did not want to go to a Little League baseball game nearby, and the defendant watched her while the family was gone. Fowler said the defendant was protective over Leila. “He took care of her,” he said, and the two had a “better than normal” relationship. The day Leila was murdered, Fowler said he and his wife, Crystal, received multiple calls from the defendant. During one call, the defendant said Leila had a headache and asked what to do. The next call, the defendant said an intruder had entered the home. Fowler added that the defendant’s mother is not in the picture. “He hasn’t spent the night at his mother’s house since he was 7 (or) 8 years old,” he said. The crime was reported at 12:15 p.m. Leila was taken to Mark Twain Medical Center in San Andreas, where she was pronounced dead at 1:01 p.m. The defendant was arrested May 11, 2013. He is not being tried as an adult. His trial, which began Sept. 15, is being held in open court due to a statute that allows juvenile murder trials to be public. No jury will decide the case. Instead, Calaveras County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Smith will deliver a verdict. The trial is scheduled to resume today.
