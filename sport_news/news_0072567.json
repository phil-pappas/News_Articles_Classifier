Freidag shot 88-84 Friday and Saturday to tie for 19th out of 103 golfers and lead Eastland to an eighth-place finish out of 12 teams at Red Tail Run in Decatur. \"I am so proud of my team,\" Freidag said. \"We knew we were coming in as the smallest school, and we were nervous about that. Our goal was to finish about fifth, but I am happy with how we came out and played.\" Freidag had said her \"top goal\" coming in was a top-10 finish, but that anything in the top 20 would be good. \"It would have been really nice to be top 10, but both days weren't really my day,\" she said. \"I could have done a lot better, but for not having my day, I will definitely take 19th. \"As a team, we all didn't do our best, but we all had a lot of fun.\" Bailey Heckman shot 86-89—175 for Eastland, while Grace Norton shot 89-99—188 and freshman Jenna French 113-111—224 to round out Eastland's scorin g. Class AA Girls Freeport freshman Maxine Nesemeier moved up 10 places Saturday to tie for 59th out of 107 golfers at the girls Class AA tourney at Hickory Point in Decatur. She shot 88-85—173 for the two days. \"She had a great day,\" Freeport coach Kevin Budden said. \"It was a great experience for a freshman to be down at the state tournament and then to play as well as she did. I am hoping the next three years she can go back down there and compete for a medal.\" Rockford sophomore Madasyn Pettersen won the AA title by one stroke at even par 144.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:20:15.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
