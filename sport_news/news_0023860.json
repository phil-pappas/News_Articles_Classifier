It’s important they can relate to players and that players respect them.” \nBlair, 41, and Toppert, 32, each bring a blend of playing and coaching experience. \nBlair was the 35th overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1996 NBA Draft. He played professionally from 1996-2009, mostly in Europe, after playing four seasons (1992-1996) at Arizona, where he is still the Wildcats’ all-time leader in field goal percentage and eighth in career blocks. \nBlair, who averaged 10.4 points and 6.5 rebounds at Arizona, spent the last two seasons as a student assistant and graduate assistant at Arizona. He will oversee the Vipers’ defense. \n“The thing with Joseph is he’s knowledgeable,” said Brase, who has known Blair for quite some time. “He’s a former player, he’s played a long time overseas, and since he’s retired he’s been heavily involved with coaching, especially the last two years. He brings a good dynamic as a former player.” \nBrase learned of Toppert through basketball circles. \nToppert is highly recognized for his work in player development, having spent the last two years as the Director of Basketball Development and coach for ELEV|8 Sports Institute in Florida. During the offseason, Toppert trained players preparing for the NBA Draft and international play. Additionally, he coached at many camps and clinics across the country, including the NBA Pre-Draft Combine in 2013 and 2014. \nToppert — who finished eighth overall in Cornell history in points, first in 3-pointers made and first in career games played — played professionally in the NBA D-League with Albuquerque, where he helped win a 2005-2006 championship. He played professionally in New Zealand and across Europe until 2012. \nToppert will oversee the Vipers’ offense. \n“Cody is a huge player development guy who has a lot of energy and a lot of ideas,” said Brase, who liked Toppert’s “vibe and positivity” during the interview process. “He’s a guy that lives in the gym.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:45:23.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
