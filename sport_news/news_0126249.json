They’ll take the court against the Lakers at The Pond in Anaheim, and I don’t know about you, but when I think ponds, I’m always thinking Orange County. \nThe arena is officially known as the Honda Center , but it’s always been The Pond to fans of the NHL Anaheim Ducks (and was actually known as Arrowhead Pond before the building’s ownership changed). So there’s a history lesson you really can’t do without. \nThe Warriors won’t see Kobe Bryant , who has been out several days with a bruised lower leg, but they’ll see Metta World Peace , if that helps. At the age of 36, the former Ron Artest (still addressed that way by friends) is battling guard Jabari Parker for the Lakers’ final roster spot, and he’s said to have the edge. \nAlways good for a lively quote, the Peace-dog recently told reporters he could “see the growth” on this L.A. team. “We’re the underdog team right now. It’ll be a great story in a couple years - well, this year - when the Lakers go to the playoffs.” \nNot likely. The Lakers are due for another year of conflicting agendas: the future, which is all about Julius Randle , D’Angelo Russell and Jordan Clarkson, against the wants and needs of Bryant, probably in his last year as he clogs up the Lakers’ payroll at $20 million. \nPut it this way: Big possession against a top Western Conference team. The Lakers really need to know what they’ve got in these young guys. Can they be trusted? But Kobe’s out there, wanting the ball. You think they won’t give it to him? \nAll indications point to a surge in the Warriors’ energy level tonight, although you wonder if that even matters. They’ll have four days off before Tuesday night’s season opener against New Orleans, so the real emphasis will be on specific issues, such as: \n•Defense. The Warriors play it as well as anybody, but as interim coach Luke Walton said, “We’re going out there and giving up 60 points in a half. We can’t have that.” \n•A last exhibition look at guards Ian Clark and Chris Babb , prime candidates for the final roster spot. Clark has had the edge throughout this road trip. \n•Draymond Green finding that second gear. Not terribly motivated by preseason games, and not yet in optimum shape, Green has been most notable of late for fouls - four in the first quarter against the Lakers in San Diego, then five in 24 minutes against the Clippers Tuesday night. You have to believe the sight of Anthony Davis and ex-Warriors assistant Alvin Gentry will get Green very interested on Tuesday night at Oracle. \n•Increased leadership and playing time from Shaun Livingston . He’s been excellent throughout the preseason, following through on management’s hopes to be even more valuable on the offensive end. He also took it upon himself to call out the Clippers’ Blake Griffin for a reckless-elbow approach (especially uncool in an exhibition game) Tuesday night. \n•One thing for the Warriors to realize on that score: Everyone’s coming for them this year, without letup. And some of the teams will be downright angry. \nIn closing, we offer this critique of the Lakers from the great Zach Lowe , of grantland.com: \n“This could be the most watchable awful team in NBA history. Kobe’s fight against time, and his refusal to acknowledge what it has done to his game, is great theater. He has resisted the step down from star to role player, but the Lakers have enough ball handlers now that Kobe should feel comfortable dialing back his usage. But there will be games when he loses patience with the kiddos, when every teammate seems as soft as Charmin, and he reaches down for the pivots, spins, and fadeaways that were once unguardable. Those shots rarely go in anymore, and they require more and more arc as Kobe’s hops expire. They stand against every trend of the post-2010 NBA. Still, they carry a potent nostalgia. \n“Also potent is the Lakers’ unmatched collection of unintentional comedy fodder: Lou Williams , Kobe, and Nick Young sharing one ball; Young doing literally anything; Ryan Kelly ’s hair; Metta World Peace and Marcelo Huertas being here for some reason; Robert Sacre’s bench antics; the inevitable blank stare from Roy Hibbert when Kobe screams at him; fans slowly realizing Clarkson is about to become a free agent even though the team had the leverage and cap room to push for a longer deal; and Byron Scott , dead man walking.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:47:34.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
