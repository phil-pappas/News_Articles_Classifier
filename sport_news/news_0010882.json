(Dean Rutz / The Seattle Times) The Seahawks pulled ahead once more on Marshawn Lynch's first rushing touchdown of the season. \nOne sustained drive deserves another, apparently. \nThe Seahawks put together their best drive of the game so far on Sunday, a 12-play drive that went 90 yards in 5:30 and was capped off by a Marshawn Lynch 1-yard touchdown run with 8 minutes to go. It was Lynch’s first touchdown of the season. \nThe touchdown was Lynch’s 55th with the Seahawks, tying Curt Warner for the second-most rushing TDs in Seahawks history. Shaun Alexander holds the record with 100.
