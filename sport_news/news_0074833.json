Starting times are 12:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. \nHurricane Joaquin may have a say in that, as rain is expected in the area on Saturday. \nThe Yankees arrived in town after clinching an AL wild-card berth with a 4-1 win over Boston on Thursday night. It was the franchise's 10,000th regular-season victory. \nThis three-game series between AL East rivals runs through Sunday. The Yankees open postseason play Tuesday with a winner-take-all, wild-card matchup. \nBaltimore was eliminated from contention earlier this week.
