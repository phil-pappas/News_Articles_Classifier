PAUL RODRIGUEZ , STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Lakers guard Kobe Bryant appears ready to go for the Lakers' regular-season opener against Minnesota on Wednesday at Staples Center. PAUL RODRIGUEZ , STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER By JANIS CARR / Staff Writer \nEL SEGUNDO – Kobe Bryant whipped passes to the right and to the left. He ran the fast break Sunday, participated in a full scrimmage and even engaged in some trash talking, all of which means one thing. \nBryant is back. \nAccording to eyewitnesses, Bryant, outside a bit of rustiness, appears ready to go for the Lakers ’ regular-season opener against Minnesota on Wednesday at Staples Center. \n“He looked pretty good,” Lakers coach Byron Scott said. “He ran well. Shot the ball pretty well. He was OK. We’ll see how he feels tomorrow and then we will go from there.” \nBryant has missed the past two weeks, including the final three preseason games, because of bruise on his lower left leg, an injury he suffered in the Lakers’ preseason game in Las Vegas. But the Lakers star apparently showed little effects of an 11-day layoff. \n“He was on the fast break,” World Peace said. “I was like, ‘Wow, Kobe’s back.’” \nScott admitted he harbored some concerns about Bryant’s readiness for the season heading into Sunday’s practice. \n“I told him if he couldn’t go today or tomorrow, I would start worrying,” Scott said. “So, he walked out today and said he felt good, gave me the thumbs up and went through the scrimmage and everything.” \nThat included flashes of Bryant’s competitiveness. \nWorld Peace said that during a scrimmage two players, reportedly Nick Young and Lou Williams, on the opposing team “decided to (trash) talk to Kobe. That was the wrong thing to do.” \nBryant’s team, which included World Peace, overcame a deficit to win the scrimmage. \n“I’m not going to disclose any names because we’re a very confidential organization,” World Peace said. “But it wasn’t the right move. It was definitely not smart.” \nBryant left the court to get treatment before reporters were allowed into practice, but World Peace was eager to discuss how impressive the 37-year-old guard looked. He predicted Bryant would “play well” and opponents are going to have their hands full defensively. \n“You have to double him. You’re not going to be able to guard him one-on-one,” World Peace said. “We’ll see who succeeds with that. He’s hungry. He’s excited. He looks great. He’s still playing basketball. He’s still enjoying the game. \n“That’s what’s most important. He comes out here and enjoys and plays basketball. He’s doing the right thing, taking care of his body and enjoying talking trash and playing basketball.” \nGOOD GUY AWARD \nWorld Peace already raffled off his 2010 NBA championship ring, raising $671,000 for mental health. Now, the Lakers forward is putting his 2003-04 NBA Defensive Player of the Year trophy up for auction. \nThis time, World Peace is looking to raise $2 million to help young men become better fathers and husbands. \n“A lot of kids learn how to calls girls ‘b’s’ and ‘h’s,’” World Peace said. “What about learning how to be a good father and be a good partner?” \nHe called it “family defense” and said it was related to mental health. \n“It's different, but it's all in the same genre,” World Peace said, “because a lot of families that are dysfunctional, it can cause mental health issues and mental health problems. \n“I think teaching the importance of being a good family man and being a good partner, I think that will help a lot of issues with mental health because most of that is born from the family household.” \nCUTS COMING \nJabari Brown is trying not to worry about losing the final roster spot to World Peace, a loveable veteran who is hoping for a second stint with the Lakers. \n“A lot of times you’re going to be fighting against a veteran, but it doesn’t help he has a ring, but …you know, once you won one, you want another one,” Brown said. \n“Whatever is going to happen is going to happen.” \nSAD DAY \nScott said he didn’t know Flip Saunders well, but learned about the Minnesota Timberwolves coach through their playing days and various coaching functions. Saunders, 60, died Sunday of cancer. \n“Obviously I’m saddened of Flip’s passing,” Scott said. “In my dealings with Flip, he was a terrific man. We lost a real good person way too soon.” \nContact the writer: jcarr@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:37:18.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
