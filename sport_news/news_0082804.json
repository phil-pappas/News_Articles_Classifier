(Photo by Greg Macafee) Greg MacAfee Reporter CAMP VERDE- The season is coming to an end, and the Camp Verde boys' soccer team is making their final push to make their case for the State tournament. With a 5-1 victory over Arizona Charter Academy on Saturday, they are one step closer. Wesley Loveall got the scoring started for the young Cowboys team when he put away a rebound off a Cody Fant shot. Fant took off down the left sideline and was all by himself when he ripped a shot from 15 yards out that the Bulldogs keeper was able to push away only to have Loveall ready and waiting. Daryusch Siejek tied the game at one, when he broke away from the Cowboys defense and buried one in the corner to keep the Bulldogs alive. Ten minutes after Siejek tied the game, Nathan Schultz almost put the Cowboys back on top. Cody Fant fed Schultz with a beautiful through ball that put the speedy forward into open space, only to have that ACA keeper come out from his goal mouth to stop Schultz in his tracks. Schultz was not going to be denied again though. Six-minutes later, he put one into the back of the net to put the Cowboys up 2-1, and their lead was not threatened again. Schultz almost tacked on another one 30-seconds later when Darren Franklin led him with a great pass. Schultz put the shot on net, and with the keeper beat it seemed as though it was a sure goal, only to be denied by ACA defense man Ian Jackson who made a play on the ball on the goal line kicking it out of bounds.At the 8-minute mark the Cowboys tacked on their third goal of the game. Bo Bullard pulled off some nifty foot work dribbling through the Bulldogs defense and putting a shot on goal that wouldn't be denied and the Cowboys extended their lead to two. Four minutes before the half the Cowboys tacked on their final goal of the first half. Darren Franklin chipped a ball over the Bulldog defenders to have Schultz ready and waiting. Schultz went up for the ball against Jackson and won the battle, placing a head ball into the back of the net. The Cowboys went up three going into halftime. The Cowboys were able to tack on one more in the second half, but they were not short on attempts, as they had many opportunities to extend the lead. At the 30-minute mark Bullard fed Franklin with a beautiful ball off a corner kick, but the header went wide right. Nathan Pineda almost tacked on another goal for the Cowboys when he ripped a shot from the 15-yard line that ricocheted off the crossbar. The Cowboys head into their last game of the season Tuesday evening when they travel to take on Phoenix Country Day at 4 p.m.Sitting at #12 in the AIA Rankings, Camp Verde should be set for a berth into the state playoffs with a victory or a tie against Phoenix Country Day. As of Tuesday morning PCD sits at the number six spot in the AIA rankings. -- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee and Instagram @VerdeValleyNews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:36:48.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
