An autopsy revealed two pounds of cocaine pellets inside the stomach of a Brazilian drug mule who bit a man on an Aer Lingus flight from Lisbon to Dublin.\nPathologists found $63,300 worth of cocaine inside John Kennedy Santos Gurjao’s stomach during an autopsy, according to local reports.\nIt’s believed at least one of those 80 pellets burst during Sunday’s flight causing the Boa Vista native to fall ill and die, the Irish Times reported citing a toxicology report.\nThe flight crew handcuffed Gurjao at some point during his drug-induced fit. He reportedly bit a Portuguese passenger trying to help him through a seizure, a witness told the Times.\n“You could hear him to start to ... well, screaming isn’t quite the word,” the witness told the Dublin-based paper. “It was a guttural noise, like a wounded animal.”\nA doctor and nurse aboard the flight were unable to save Gurjao. The pilots diverted flight EI 485 to the Cork airport, where paramedics pronounced Gurjao dead.\nHis travel companion, a 44-year-old Portuguese woman, was detained on suspicion of carrying drugs, but the white powder found in her luggage was identified as flour used for baking Brazilian bread.\nIt’s believed Gurjao was on his way to Dublin to study English before his Visa expired.\nIt’s not clear where Gurjao obtained the pellets of cocaine.\nnhensley@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Man restrained by Aer Lingus crew dies after biting traveler", "external_links": ["http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/man-died-on-plane-after-drugs-burst-in-stomach-1.2398015"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:12:41.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
