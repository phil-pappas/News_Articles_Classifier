Filed: Monday, October 19, 2015 at 02:11 UK Last Updated: Monday, October 19, 2015 at 02:12 UK \nFanendo Adi struck a second-half brace as Portland Timbers came from behind to beat Los Angeles Galaxy 5-2 and boost their MLS playoff hopes. \nBruce Arena 's men, who had already sealed their MLS Cup berth, came within inches of moving ahead inside just four minutes, with Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard watching a free kick cannon off the crossbar. \nIt was Leonardo 's turn to rattle the woodwork with a header on 18 minutes, before Giovanni Dos Santos fired a rebound just wide as luck continued to shine on Portland. \nThe hosts finally earned the breakthrough shortly after the half-hour mark, when Keane's first-time volley from outside the box found the top corner to leave Adam Kwarasey with no chance. \nGalaxy rested on their laurels and the Timbers started the second period well, before flipping the game on its head midway through the half. First, Adi levelled up on 65 minutes, before converting a penalty three minutes later after being fouled by Dan Gargan in the area. \nDiego Chara added a third in the final quarter as the visitors took a big step toward the points, but Keane reduced the arrears with six minutes to play. \nHowever, Darlington Nagbe struck moments later, as did Maximiliano Urruti , as Portland rounded off an emphatic second-half display to move fourth in the Western Conference by three points, with one game to play. \nThey host bottom-of-the-table Colorado Rapids in Oregon next week.
