He is Marky Bionci, 15, and today Bengals players made his wish come true. When Marky Bionci walked into Paul Brown Stadium, he was noticeably nervous. This was Marky's wish granted by the Make a Wish Foundation. He lives in the Cleveland area but his wish was to meet the Bengals and his favorite players A.J. Green and Andy Dalton. Dalton was impressed with Marky's spirals. Marky said it was the best day of his life. It was an emotional day for Marky's parents to see their son's wish come true. Marky is 15 and suffers from cystic fibrosis Marky will be a special guest of the team on Sunday when the Bengals take on the Seattle Seahawks at Paul Brown Stadium. \nFollow Larry Davis on Twitter @larrydaviswkrc and LIKE him on Facebook.
