It was the Arsenal attacker's seventh goal in nine games for club and country.\nSterling didn't add England's second goal until the 85th minute of a low-quality game, sliding in to meet Jamie Vardy's cross and put the ball in the net.\n\"We played against a well-organized team and a team that's quite intelligent in the way they played,\" Hodgson said. \"We had to work very hard for it. We attacked a lot and we had a lot of the ball.\n\"We had quite a few chances but it was a question of whether we could put them away.\"\nEngland was without injured captain Wayne Rooney, whose only appearance on the field was before the game to collect a golden boot from Bobby Charlton after breaking his England scoring record by netting for a 50th time in last month's win against Switzerland.\n1 CONNECT Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
