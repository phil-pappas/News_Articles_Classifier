(AP) — Buffalo Sabres forward Evander Kane will be out approximately four to six weeks because of an injury to his left knee. \nCoach Dan Bylsma provided the update after practice on Monday, two days after Kane was hurt in a 4-3 loss to the New Jersey Devils. Without revealing the exact nature of the injury, Bylsma said Kane won’t require surgery after hurting his medial collateral ligament. \nHe was hurt while chasing down a puck in the right corner and was struck in the knee by Devils defenseman David Schlemko. \nKane is a top-line forward who has a goal and two assists in eight games. \nThe injury is the latest setback for Kane, who was sidelined by a season-ending shoulder injury when Buffalo acquired him in a trade with Winnipeg in February.
