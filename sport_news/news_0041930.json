Why? Because it's the setting for one of the biggest action scenes in the latest Bond movie, Spectre.Released on November 6, the film will show 007 (Daniel 'I'm only in it for the cash' Craig) skulking around the slopes of this stylish Austrian resort, possibly shooting/running from baddies, although as this is Bond, let's not get too hung up on the plot.Associate producer Gregg Wilson said Austria offered everything the film-makers needed to make the all- action movie.During filming, producer Dennis Gassner said he had \"made a long journey through many countries to find the right location. We found a very unique modern facility that we were looking for.\"So, if you get an unusually high number of clients looking for ski holidays in Solden this year, you'll know why. \nWednesday, October 14, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:03:32.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
