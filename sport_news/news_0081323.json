Ramapo defeated Don Bosco in the other quarterfinal, 1-0.\nIndians goalkeeper Josh Ulin, who gave a heroic performance with an astounding 18 saves, believes that the Indians are playing with pure emotion.\nUlin's friend and classmate, Zack Latteri, died in July after a 5 1/2-year battle with leukemia.\n\"I play for Zack every single day,\" Ulin said. \"He's my motivation for everything. If he could stay strong through all he's been through, then we could all benefit from it.\"\nLin agreed.\n\"Everyone thinks of Zack every time we play,\" said Lin, who knocked home a direct free kick from about 30 yards out. \"My teammates all wanted me to take the kick. Once I hit it, I knew it was in.\"\n\"Mike Lin is a tremendous player for us,\" Nygren said. \"He showed a lot of courage today, because he was playing with an injured leg. He just curled that shot to the back of the net and that was it.\"\nLin's shot sent Bergen Catholic (9-1-2) to defeat for the first time this season.\n\"I think this is extremely disappointing, because we played a tremendous game of soccer,\" Bergen Catholic head coach Pete Berkanish said. \"We controlled a good portion of the game. When you come out on the negative side, it hurts tremendously.\"\nThe Crusaders held a commanding 21-6 advantage in shots on goal, yet couldn't collect the victory over the Indians (9-3).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:38.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
