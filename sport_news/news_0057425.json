By ANDY ROBERTSON LOG CABIN STAFF WRITER \nSaturday marked the eighth Soaring Wings of Conway races with an added feature of a marathon this year. \nThe inaugural Soaring Wings of Conway Marathon started and ended at the McGee Center with Erik Leamon, 40 of Conway, finishing in first place with a time of 1:22.50 and a pace of 6:20 per mile. \nAmanda Castillo of Soaring Wings said the event is huge for Conway because of the recognition and the economy it brings. \nIn addition to the half and full marathon, some participants took part in a half-marathon relay and children through sixth grade ran a fun run on Friday evening. \nAbout 2,000 people from various states participated in the either the half-marathon or the marathon on a rainy morning. “We were so excited because the runners came out in full force and the weather didn’t hurt at all,” Castillo said. “Runners are a little crazy though, so they’ll get out in whatever.” \nSeveral people raced for different causes such as Jajuan Archer, founder, and Carol Funkhouser from Women Own Worth, a nonprofit organization that works with victims of domestic violence. \nFunkhouser said she trained by running a lot and put a lot of heart in the race. \n“Carol asked me to run,” Archer said. “I did not train, but I was able to race and finished because I was running for the victims who lost their life in 2013 by domestic violence. I had all their names on my arms and they inspired me to finish.” \nThe race followed a familiar course for people who have ran the half-marathon in the past, but the marathon portion split at mile 10.5. \nWhere half-marathon runners turned right on Tyler Street, marathon runners took their course on the Gatlin Park Trail, through the tunnel under Prince Street, and then downtown and to south Conway before heading to the finish line. \nOne of the factors runners had to deal with was the rain that had occurred Friday and early Saturday morning. However, during the race, it wasn’t much of a factor. \n“Because of our spirit was to finish and we had a goal in mind, we didn’t care if stormed we were going to finish,” Funkhouser said. “If they called the race because of lightning, we were still going to keep course and finish our course.” \nThe benefits from the marathon and half marathon will go to the Soaring Wings Ranch, a Christian home for children from ages 2-18 who are in need of a loving, stable home. \nParticipants received an official T-shirt, refreshments after the race, and a custom medal from the age bracket and race in which they participated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:54:12.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
