KING — State Journal \nUW tight end Austin Traylor had two catches for 35 yards in Saturday’s loss to Iowa, including this reception for a first down in the fourth quarter. Buy Now M.P. KING — State Journal \nUW outside linebacker Joe Schobert accounted for eight tackles, four tackles for loss, three sacks, five quarterback hurries, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery in Saturday’s loss to Iowa. He was named the Big Ten Conference Co-Defensive Player of the Week. \nThe University of Wisconsin football team could be without two of its top pass-catchers in Saturday’s game at Nebraska. \nUW coach Paul Chryst said Monday that Austin Traylor (right arm) will miss at least one week, and wide receiver Alex Erickson is still going through concussion protocol after leaving last week’s loss to Iowa early in the third quarter. \nChryst said Traylor, who was injured late in the fourth quarter against the Hawkeyes, was scheduled to have a procedure later Monday that would give a better idea on a timetable for his return. \n“The thing that is disappointing to me is that Austin was really playing good football,” Chryst said. “And Joel (Stave) actually mentioned to me today how he’s having fun. He’ll be out this week, and we’ll find out how much more after that, but those are opportunities he won’t get back.” \nTraylor ranks third on the team with 156 receiving yards, and his three receiving touchdowns match Robert Wheelwright for most among UW players. \nErickson, the team’s unquestioned No. 1 receiver, leads UW with 26 catches and 350 receiving yards this season. \nChryst said he spoke with Erickson on Sunday and that he “feels better” but has not been cleared to play. Friendly competition \nPaul Chryst and Mike Riley — friends since Riley hired Chryst with the San Antonio Riders of the World League of American Football in 1991 — will face off for the first time as Big Ten Conference head coaches on Saturday. \nChryst doesn’t expect the competition with his former mentor to make his job any tougher when the Badgers take on Nebraska. \n“I don’t know if I learned it or it was reinforced to me by being with Mike, but the game’s not about us,” Chryst said. “It would be hard to coach against players you’ve coached. I thought what (UW defensive backs coach) Daronte’ (Jones) went through the other week (against Hawaii) would be harder. \n“I’m proud to be a coach and I’ve learned a ton from Mike, but I think one of the things we have in common is we respect the game and truly respect those who play it, and our job is to help them play it. I don’t feel like it’s me against Mike. I don’t think it will be (difficult).” \nThe two also worked together at Oregon State (1997-98, 2003-04) and with the San Diego Chargers from 1999-2001. \nBoth coaches desperately need a victory in the first season at their respective schools as both failed to win their Big Ten openers last week. UW lost to Iowa 10-6 at home and Nebraska fell to Illinois 14-13 in Champaign. \nWhichever team loses Saturday will find it difficult to catch up in the race for the Big Ten West Division title. \n“The most pressure I feel is from me,” Chryst said. “I think the most pressure, I don’t want to speak for Mike, but I’ve been around him. Mike’s at his best when people might think that it’s hard times.” Schobert honored \nUW outside linebacker Joe Schobert was named Big Ten Co-Defensive Player of the Week with Iowa defensive back Desmond King. \nSchobert was the star of Saturday’s game against the Hawkeyes in a losing effort, recording eight tackles, four tackles for loss, three sacks, five quarterback hurries, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. \n“The thing that amazes me is not just the stat line, but he does it in big moments,” Chryst said. “I love what he’s doing for us on special teams. He’s not just an effort guy. He’s got some real talent. It’s been fun to see.” Extra points \nUW’s right tackle spot on its depth chart is now listed as Jacob Maxwell OR Hayden Biegel. Maxwell, a redshirt freshman, made his first career start Saturday against Iowa while Biegel was out with an undisclosed injury. … True freshman Olive Sagapolu is now listed as the No. 2 nose tackle on the depth chart over Jeremy Patterson. Sagapolu made his first career start Saturday against Iowa and rotated with Conor Sheehy throughout the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:17:42.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
