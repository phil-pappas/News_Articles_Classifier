They should play their fullback on defense more often.\nFullback Nikita Whitlock leads the league with four appearances on both offense and defense this season, according to Stats LLC. Beginning in the team’s third game, he has played several snaps every contest as a defensive tackle, tallying one sack, two quarterback hits and two hurries, according to Pro Football Focus.\nPressuring the quarterback five times in 23 snaps makes Whitlock the league’s most efficient pass-rushing defensive tackle, according to Pro Football Focus, putting him above stars such as Cincinnati’s Geno Atkins and Miami’s Ndamukong Suh.\nYes, there are caveats to that. It’s a small sample size, and Whitlock has played mostly in obvious passing downs. It’s not clear how Whitlock, who stands 5-foot-10 and weighs 250 pounds, would handle defending running plays over the course of a full game while dealing with offensive linemen who outweigh him by 50 or more pounds.\nThere’s also one other impediment to him playing defensive tackle full-time. Whitlock currently trains mostly with the Giants offense.\n“Got to get him off that other side of the ball is what we got to do,” Giants defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said. “He doesn’t come out and practice with us on defense...He’s done a great job with that, not getting a lot of reps. When he goes out there and [I] say, ‘OK, this is the menu of calls you have,’ that shrinks. We haven’t been able to steal him too many times in practice. When we’re able to do that, we’ll expand the menu a little bit.”\nYet at this point, it’s worth trying Whitlock as a full-time defender. The current rotation of defensive linemen, which includes tackles Johnathan Hankins and Markus Kuhn and ends Cullen Jenkins and Kerry Wynn, hasn’t produced a substantial pass rush. The Giants have eight sacks, tied for league’s third-fewest. That helps explain why their overall defense is ranked 28th in yards per game and 30th in passing yards per game.\nWhitlock, 24 years old, isn’t just a regular fullback. He played nose tackle in college at Wake Forest, but didn’t think he could cut it at the position in the NFL at his height and weight, so he converted to fullback. He spent time with the Cincinnati Bengals and Cowboys before the Giants signed him to their practice squad in December 2014.\nWhitlock made the main 53-man roster after training camp this year because coaches loved his versatility and willingness to play any position. He has mostly played on special teams. As a fullback, he has appeared in 59 of 425 offensive snaps, or 14%, according to Pro Football Focus. He has played in only 31 of 448 of defensive plays, or 7%.\nOne of the friendliest players in the locker room—he recently recounted a story about how football teammates once helped him get into a nightclub even though he was wearing socks with sandals.\nWhitlock said his decision to play both offense and defense is because he wanted to get more playing time any way possible. He said he is working on getting better on both offense and defense. And also on drinking more water.\n“They do a hydration test on us every Thursday and I’ve been coming back dehydrated a lot,” Whitlock said. He now tries to carry two or three water bottles with him at all times, in part to avoid running backs coach Craig Johnson nagging him. “Coach Johnson has been on me pretty heavy: ‘Drink water. Why aren’t you drinking? I don’t see a bottle of water in your hand,’” Whitlock said.\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:20:57.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
