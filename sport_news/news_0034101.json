Because Jones was under pressure to win and get a NCAA tourney bid, so he and his team had virtually no margin of error, especially with a few nagging early injuries.\n\"When you play a tough schedule, it's demanding and the games are close and each possession is so important, you don't rotate your bench as much,\" Jones said. \"This year we're hoping with some of the experience we had from our bench guys, along with this talented group of freshmen, we can manage the minutes better. The earlier we can develop a bench, the quicker we can lower minutes (for starters) to the 27 to 30 minutes range.\"\nEven for someone like Hornsby, who has Forrest Gump-like coast-to-coast stamina, playing without the safety net of a reliable bench last season was more mentally than physically taxing.\n\"When you play a lot of minutes,\" said Hornsby, who averaged a team-leading 35.3 minutes per game, which was also second in the SEC, \"subconsciously you're going to have the foul count in your head. Nobody wants to be out of the game with two fouls at the 15-minute mark in the first half. You have to find a way to play super aggressively and not make any stupid fouls.\"\nBecause the Tigers' depth didn't often didn't go past one guard and maybe one inside player, almost all their conference games took a predictable track. If LSU stayed out of foul trouble, got off to fast starts and maintained double digit leads through the first half, it usually had enough fouls to give and plenty of fuel in the tank in the second half to hold on for wins.\nBut when that didn't happen. . .\nAlso, at the end of last season, it was clear Tigers' starters like All-SEC forward Jordan Mickey were running on fumes. His production dramatically nosedived in the last two weeks of the season and in the postseason.\n\"We wore our starters down toward the end of the year,\" LSU backup point guard Josh Gray said. \"But it's going to be better this year, because we have more depth.\"\nAny depth would be an improvement. But from watching the Tigers go through their paces before the scouts, they are light years ahead of last season with a greater number of capable versatile bodies.\n\"When we go to the bench, there's no dropoff, especially all the guards (six) that we have,\" Quarterman said. \"All of us have different types of games. It will be hard for teams to scout us.\"\nHornsby noted that LSU's post players have improved. They are all returnees from last year's team including Victor, who sat out the spring semester but practiced with the team after transferring from Arizona.\n\"They've shown a new fire that I hadn't seen in them since I've been here,\" Hornsby said. \"It's almost like they heard that they are really needed right now in their roles, and they've taken to that. They're playing with a new edge and confidence.\"\nOne reason that's happening, according to Victor, is the raised talent level has naturally increased practice intensity.\n\"We have a team full of competitive spirit, especially with the incoming freshmen,\" Victor said. \"Everybody has improved and everybody wants to win. We all realize the only way to get better is to make each other better. The more we push each other, the better this team will be.\"\nOn LSU's five-game exhibition trip to Australia in early August, only Simmons averaged more than 30 minutes (35.5) per game. Three other players who started the majority of the games – Quarterman, Hornsby and Blakeney – were in the 25 to 29-minute range.\nThe top four bench players averaged between 11.3 (forward Brian Bridgewater) and 14.0 (Aaron Epps) minutes.\n\"The way Coach Jones played us in Australia, it shows he trusts the bench,\" Bridgewater said.\nThat's cool. But let's check back on that trust once SEC play starts in January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:29:19.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
