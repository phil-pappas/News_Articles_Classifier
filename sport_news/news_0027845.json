The Cavs were under no obligation to leave their $80 million offer on the table, and from what I heard, pulled it as soon as Thompson’s qualifying offer expired. \nThompson is a restricted free agent, and Cleveland’s $6.7 million qualifying offer to him expired on Oct. 1. Thompson had been holding out for a max contract, which left him and the Cavs $14 million apart in negotiations . Now that he has let the qualifying offer expire, Thompson has until March 1 to sign an offer sheet with another team — one the Cavs would have the option of matching. As Dan Feldman of Pro Basketball Talk notes, the Portland Trail Blazers and Philadelphia 76ers are the only teams with the cap space needed to offer Thompson a max contract of five years and $94 million. Neither team is expected to make that offer. \nThompson and his agent may have overplayed their hand, as the Cavs have proven with stunts like this that they are willing to play hardball. Thompson’s best negotiating chip is that LeBron wants Cleveland to keep him, but it doesn’t sound like the Cavs are worried about LeBron leaving if a deal can’t be reached with Thompson.
