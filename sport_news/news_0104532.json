Cincinnati's three defeats have come by a combined 29 points.Scouting reportUConn will win if: Its defense stops giving up big plays, which is something Cincinnati is good at doing. The Huskies were killed by big plays last week against South Florida. Diaco said he considers that defensive performance, which was otherwise good, to be a blip. It has to be if the Huskies stand a chance to pull off the upset.Cincy will win if: Its offense is its typical self. If the Bearcats go up and down the field with ease, the Huskies have no chance because they can't score enough. UConn has to find a way to keep its offense on the field for extended periods so the defense can be fresh when it has to go up against that high-tempo Bearcats attack.Key matchupsUConn DBs vs. Cincy WRs: Cincy can run the ball effectively, but would much rather heave the ball all over the place. UConn's secondary needs to be ready for that.UConn D vs. Cincy O: Cincinnati has a whopping 15 turnovers already. UConn needs to add to that total.UConn O vs. third down: As porous as Cincinnati has been defensively, it is awfully good on third down, allowing opponents to convert on just 25 percent of its attempts.UConn Cincy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:15:38.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
