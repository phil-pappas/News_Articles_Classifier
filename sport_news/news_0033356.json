(Photo by Bill Smith/NHLI via Getty Images)\nChicago Blackhawks forward Marian Hossa is a grizzled veteran by hockey standards, but the 36-year-old intends to continue playing as long as he's having fun.\nAdChoices Hossa admitted the party is still going, perhaps with a big assist as a result of playing on a team that has won the Stanley Cup three times in six seasons. However, will Hossa still be having fun into his 40s - like 43-year-old Jaromir Jagr of the Florida Panthers?\n\"That's unbelievable that he's still playing in a high-paced game,\" the five-time All-Star told Mark Lazerus of the Chicago Sun-Times . \"There aren't many players like him. But as long as I'm healthy and having fun, I would love to play.\"\nHossa, who signed a 12-year, $62.8 million deal in July 2009, has notched two assists in the first three games of this season. The 12th overall pick of the 1997 draft, Hossa has scored 486 goals and set up 572 others in 1,175 career contests with the Ottawa Senators, Winnipeg Jets, Pittsburgh Penguins, Detroit Red Wings and Blackhawks.\n(h/t Chicago Sun-Times )\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/1021916/marian-hossa-showing-signs-slowing", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:04:45.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
