Daniels and running back Rod Smith on Tuesday after media reports indicated they planned to sign free-agent cornerback Crezdon Butler.\nThe Butler news, firs t reported Monday night by Rand Getlin of NFL Network , has yet to become official.\nBut the decision to waive Daniels and Smith from the 53-man roster means there's room for Butler and wide receiver Paul Richardson, who is set to come off the PUP (physically unable to perform) list next week.\nDaniels appeared in two games for the Seahawks after an offseason switch from quarterback to wide receiver. He caught one pass, a 12-yard reception against the Detroit Lions on Oct. 5. If he clears waivers, he could return to the Seahawks practice squad, where he spent most of last season.\nSame goes for Smith, who made his season debut last Sunday in the Seahawks loss to the Bengals and ran twice for five yards. \nThe Seahawks need secondary depth because cornerback Tharold Simon will miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery on his toe. He was placed on injured reserve last week while Smith was put on the 53-man roster.\nMeanwhile, nickel cornerback Marcus Burley has a broken thumb and cornerback Tye Smith missed Sunday's loss with a hip injury.\nButler, 28, played in 11 games (three starts) last season for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers but was waived in December. He spent training camp with the Detroit Lions but was waived before the start of the regular season. \nA fifth-round pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2010 NFL draft, Butler has played for six NFL teams after attending Clemson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:45:09.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
